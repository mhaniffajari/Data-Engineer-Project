Developing an AI model from scratch means handling large amounts of unstructured data. This is crucial for any model’s success, but it is often resource intensive with little margin for error. As AI models advance and become more accessible, these so-called “frontier” data would grow even more in terms of quality, quantity, and complexity.
Scale AI, which calls itself an AI data foundry services firm, helps AI model developers like OpenAI, Toyota, and even the US Department of Defense to label their data. Its platform acts as a foundry for the end-to-end AI lifecycle, helping clients collect, curate, and annotate data.
The company, which is based in San Francisco, has secured US$1 billion in a series F funding round, bringing its valuation to nearly US$14 billion. Backers include Amazon, Meta, and Nvidia, as well as Y Combinator, Founders Fund, and Intel Capital.
Since its founding in 2016, Scale AI has worked with companies like Microsoft, Meta, and Anthropic. Its tech has been integrated into AI offerings across industries like ecommerce, retail, marketing, and legal.
“Our vision is one of data abundance, where we have the means of production to continue scaling frontier large language models many more orders of magnitude. We should not be data-constrained in getting to GPT-10,” said Alexandr Wang, CEO and founder of Scale AI.
In a LinkedIn post announcing the news, Wang said that Scale AI will focus on expanding its cache of frontier data “that will pave our road to artificial general intelligence.”
The series F funds will go toward improving Scale AI’s model analysis work with enterprise clients and the US Department of Defense. It also bolsters the firm’s role in the DEFCON 31 red-teaming event.

The billion-dollar discussions for Snowflake to buy AI startup Reka AI have ended without a deal, Bloomberg reported, citing sources. The report did not disclose additional details.
The deal would have helped boost Snowflake’s business, as it sees generative AI as a key growth driver for its cloud-based data analytics offerings. The company’s revenue growth had slowed due to clients spending less on software, while generative AI remains a burgeoning industry.
Snowflake had also released Arctic, its own large language model, last month.
Reka AI – which was founded by researchers from DeepMind, Google, and Meta – recently launched Reka Core, its first multimodal language model. Working with images, audio, and video, Core is “competitive” with leading models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google across industry-accepted metrics, the company had said.
In a US$58 million funding round from 2023, Reka AI was valued at around US$300 million – one participating investor was Snowflake’s investment wing. Reka AI is based in San Francisco but has two Southeast Asian founders: Singaporean Yi Tay is the company’s chief scientist, while CEO Dani Yogatama grew up in Indonesia.

However, Covid 19-induced lockdowns in major Southeast Asian markets forced CEO Anthony Chow to swiftly pivot.
“In the US, we started seeing a spike in orders despite not having a physical footprint there. The US market was still growing due to the rise of rental properties. Nobody wants to own assets anymore,” Chow tells Tech in Asia.
Chow flew to the US during the pandemic to establish an office in Austin, Texas in 2022. Today, the US accounts for 60% of the firm’s business, Europe for 20%, with Asia making up the rest, according to the executive.

In the past two years, founders from Southeast Asia – especially Singapore – have increasingly expanded to the world’s top consumer market, driven by the impact of Covid-19 and the realization that conquering their home region is no longer a prerequisite for success.
In terms of strategy, this stands in stark contrast to some of the largest tech companies in the region, such as Grab and Sea Group.
But is the allure of the US market justified?
Banking on high labor cost
Igloohome sells smart locks for homeowners and businesses, so the higher the cost of labor in an area, “the more likely people [there] are going to buy our products,” Chow notes.
Igloohome’s engineering, firmware development, and manufacturing are still based in Asia, Chow says. For him, establishing a local office in the US is essential for building trust with American customers. Igloohome isn’t profitable yet, and it plans to fundraise by the end of the year.
Chee Tung Leong echoes the same sentiment, which explains why the co-founder of HR tech firm EngageRocket relocated his entire family to Silicon Valley in 2022.
EngageRocket provides an analytics platform for companies to track, manage, and retain employees. When the startup raised US$2.1 million in March 2020, it had just opened an office in Jakarta.
However, maintaining growth in Southeast Asia had its limits, whereas the software as a service (SaaS) market value in the US could reach US$150 billion this year.

Leong considers the American market to be “much more receptive” to such platforms because companies need to retain talent to avoid rehiring and higher labor costs.
EngageRocket is still in the early stages of its US expansion. Of course, competition is fierce, but founders can benefit from the US market being more product-driven compared to Southeast Asia’s relationship-driven market, according to Leong.
“The purchase decision is more about ‘can this software do the job?’ Even if they [US customers] don’t know you, they’ll keep it.”

For Singapore-headquartered LionsBot, which manufactures cleaning robots, setting up its operations in Dallas, Texas 2023 was crucial.
“There’s a big need for cleaning robots in America, and there aren’t enough people to do it,” says CEO Dylan Ng. “Outside Singapore, the rest of Southeast Asia isn’t that big on cleaning robots because manpower is more affordable.”
His firm, which raised US$35 million in a series A round last year, recently launched a 4,900-square-meter factory in Singapore. However, the majority of its customers are in the US.

“The US is a giant market – even selecting where to base was a big issue for us,” says Ng. “The other challenge is how to hire people. You definitely need to hire Americans for America.”
While it’s unclear if ongoing geopolitical tensions boost sales, Ng notes that some American buyers prefer non-Chinese robots, which “help.”
Deeper pockets
Kenneth Lou, co-founder and CEO of healthtech firm Mito Health, observes that Southeast Asia tends to follow rather than lead in tech adoption.
Longevity-focused healthcare – meaning preventive measures that help people try to live longer – has been gaining attention in developed markets, such as Singapore, Japan, and the US.
However, this trend has not yet caught on in most Southeast Asian countries due to their relatively young population.

Lou, who previously co-founded personal finance firm Seedly, notes that “everyone in the longevity” market is based in the US, making Mito Health’s expansion into the country essential.
The consumer longevity startup was established just last year and secured US$1.3 million in the same period. It operates virtual clinics that analyze blood results and other biomarkers. Mito Health intends to launch similar health-screening packages in the US by the third quarter.
“In Southeast Asia, a lot of clients can’t really afford preventive healthcare services,” says Lou. Meanwhile, the US’ spending on healthcare outnumbered even other high-income countries.
In terms of willingness to pay, Brian Tan – co-founder of Singapore kidtech firm myFirst – says his startup’s products are considered by most consumers as “premium,” and parents in the US are “crying out” for solutions to protect their kids from Facebook, Instagram, or TikTok.
MyFirst offers a social media ecosystem that includes both software and devices like watch phones, cameras, earbuds, and 3D pens. The products target children aged six to 12 years, who are not old enough to use typical social media platforms.

Last month, myFirst signed a S$15 million (US$11 million) contract with manufacturer Fu Yu to accelerate its North America expansion. MyFirst already set up an office in Los Angeles and is working with big-name US retailers like Walmart, Costco, and Best Buy.
Tan also doesn’t think his startup will benefit from the strained US-China relations even as TikTok is on the verge of being banned there, because “another addictive platform will just get its place,” he says.

Beyond market expansion
Founders Tech in Asia interviewed for this story are aware of the fierce competition in the US. A lack of preparation can lead to issues with US regulators and being easily crushed by global competitors.
However, such a move could be game-changing, especially during this prolonged tech downturn.

Mito Health, for example, believes that gaining traction in America would also open up future fundraising opportunities. For now, the focus is on cost-saving measures.
CEO Lou says that Mito Health will maintain “a lower cost base” in the US, meaning that the startup partners with labs to do the bloodwork and specimen collection while it focuses on delivering personalized health insights and recommendations.
We have a plan but let’s see how badly we’ll get punched in the face.
Some Southeast Asian startups also believe that investors in the US have a greater risk appetite and are more willing to bet on emerging investment themes like climate finance. Tech funding in the region amounted to just US$5.5 billion in 2023, a 30% decline from 2022, as Tech in Asia previously reported.
So the key is to widen the pool.
At least that’s what motivates the co-founders of GreenChain from Singapore. The startup wants to attract clients and investors for its US$15,000 monthly subscription platform, which helps financial institutions track and account for emissions associated with their lending and investment activities.
Other founders are strategizing for the future, considering potential exit or listing opportunities.
“The American capital markets are just a lot more used to software multiples,” says Leong of EngageRocket. “If you want to have a liquidation event in the US, you need to show a sizable amount of traction here.”

Singapore-based myFirst is already eyeing a potential listing in the US instead of the Singapore Exchange, which has been struggling to attract tech IPOs and which CEO Tan describes as a “lousy market” to list on.
Think global
Murli Ravi, co-founder of Tin Men Capital, agrees that the US market could be more attractive than Southeast Asia for certain product categories. However, he argues that generally, it’s quite difficult for the region’s startups to expand far away, especially those with revenues below the US$10 million mark.
This is particularly more demanding for consumer-facing businesses, which often require setting up a local presence in the US.

“Customers can be more sophisticated too and will almost certainly have different expectations from customers in Southeast Asia,” he says, and the challenges could be “like starting a brand new company.”
Pun Jaruthassanakul, Seedstars International Ventures’ investment manager for Southeast Asia, points out that most startups there are still building for the region. Still, the small increase in companies targeting overseas markets could enhance local competitiveness and attract more talent, he says.
Melvin Yuan knows firsthand that the Singapore market was too small for his first company, YFind Technologies, to thrive. Yuan moved to the US 10 years ago, and his firm – which provided an indoor positioning system – was later acquired by Ruckus Networks (formerly Ruckus Wireless) in 2013.
Yuan is now founder and CEO of Stellar, which helps founders launch and run businesses in the US and other countries by managing their entire back-office operations. The cheapest package to start a US company is priced at US$399.
His advice for founders? “Forget about Southeast Asia or the US as a region – think global,” as AI is expected to drive the rise of one-person unicorns.
Meanwhile, Mito Health has recently been accepted to the coveted Y Combinator and one of the co-founders has moved to San Francisco. “The reality is that we had to pivot,” says its CEO Lou. “We have a plan but let’s see how badly we’ll get punched in the face.”
Currency converted from Singapore dollar to US dollar: US$1 = S$1.35.

PopChill, a luxury marketplace operating in Taiwan and Hong Kong, has secured an additional US$1.3 million via its pre-series A fundraise. This increases the round’s total to US$3.1 million and pushes the company’s total capital raised to US$6.2 million to date.
The most recent contributors to the round include Top Taiwan Venture Capital and the Taiwan National Development Fund. Acorn Pacific, 500 Global, ITIC, AVA Angels Fund, and Darwin Ventures are among PopChill’s existing investors.
PopChill will use the funds to reach break-even in Taiwan by the end of the year and expand its Hong Kong operations. It is also looking to enter a new market this year, with Singapore as its primary target.
The company also plans to hire 18 to 20 people to bolster its workforce. PopChill aims to capitalize on the growing luxury resale market, which has doubled in the last four years. About US$49.3 billion of secondhand luxury goods were sold globally in 2023, according to a report from Bain &amp; Company.
PopChill said its monthly growth rate in Hong Kong was at 40% in 2023, helping the company increase total transactions by 10%. In Taiwan, its annual gross merchandise volume (GMV) hit US$18.5 million, with monthly transactions exceeding US$1.5 million.
The company has partnerships with three of Japan’s top 10 luxury resellers and several suppliers in Taiwan and Hong Kong, enabling it to offer 100,000 items on its platform. Sales of high-end brands like Chanel, Louis Vuitton, and Hermes contribute 60% of PopChill’s total revenue.
Although handbags currently account for 80% of sales, PopChill plans to add watches and jewelry in its product range in the next six to 12 months.

849543,2024-05-22T01:55:40,2024-05-22T02:14:49,"Why fintech arms of GoTo, Grab, Sea deserve more attention",fintech-arms-goto-grab-sea-deserve-attention,publish,post,https://www.techinasia.com/fintech-arms-goto-grab-sea-deserve-attention,"The performance of Southeast Asian tech giants’ fintech businesses used to be something of an after-thought. That was understandable, since these companies got their start in other segments – mobility for GoTo and Grab, and gaming for Sea.
As these companies broadened into financial services, they themselves stressed that their fintech businesses were in their early stages, and would present the results of these segments only after their “main” business units.

Photo credit: Tech in Asia

Indeed, for a while, the fintech units of these firms accounted for a small portion of their overall revenue. In 2021, fintech revenue was only 7% of GoTo’s top line, while the figures for Grab and Sea were 4% and 5%, respectively.

However, those figures have risen steadily over the past few years. As their most recent results show, the time has come for investors to sit up and pay attention to the fintech businesses of these companies.
SeaMoney overtakes Garena
Currently, Sea’s financial services business – SeaMoney – is the biggest of its peer group and the only one that is profitable.
SeaMoney was established in 2014, giving it a head start over GoTo Financial’s GoPay, which was created in 2016, and Grab Financial, which launched in 2018.

But they are all growing quickly. In the first quarter of 2024, the fintech units of GoTo and Grab were the fastest-growing divisions for each firm.
Taken on its own, that isn’t new, and is to be expected for businesses that are younger and growing off a smaller base.
However, these fintech businesses are reaching a tipping point, where their scale and high growth rates are beginning to make a material difference to overall performance.
In fact, in the most recent quarter, SeaMoney overtook gaming arm Garena to become Sea Group’s second-biggest business by revenue. This may be a sign of things to come for Grab and GoTo as well.

Crucially, SeaMoney currently sports a higher profit margin than the 10% Sea Group’s ecommerce unit Shopee achieved in Q1 2023 – its all-time high – although Garena has better margins.
While Grab’s and GoTo’s fintech units are still loss-making, if both units can achieve SeaMoney’s current margins, this will boost overall group profitability.
In their recent earnings calls, GoTo said its fintech business is expected to be adjusted EBITDA positive by the end of 2025, while Grab is aiming to achieve break even for its fintech unit by the second half of 2026.
Different playbooks
Sea, GoTo, and Grab are all targeting Southeast Asia’s 600 million population, a majority of whom are unbanked or underbanked.
Many Southeast Asian SMEs are also underbanked. In a survey of 980 SMEs in the region, around 70% of respondents said that they started their business with seed money raised from personal savings or family and friends, instead of from banks or alternative lenders.
All three players are also counting on their respective ecosystem of services to provide access to borrowers, as well as the data to determine lending terms. However, their playbooks for capturing this opportunity differ.

Photo credit: GoTo Group

GoTo has the advantage of lending to a wider range of users compared to Sea and Grab. These include consumers of its on-demand services, drivers who may need help to finance owning or renting a vehicle, and its legacy buy now, pay later business on the Tokopedia platform.
Perhaps the most significant differentiator is GoTo’s and TikTok’s joint development of a BNPL product on the merged ecommerce platform, which has been rebranded as Shop | Tokopedia.
According to Thomas Husted, who runs GoTo’s fintech division, the integration of BNPL with Shop | Tokopedia is expected to be completed “over the next few months” and will provide “the next leg up” when it comes to lending growth.
However, while GoTo’s greater range of businesses may capture a wider swath of borrowers, its business is largely confined to Indonesia, whereas both Grab and Sea can access a far greater number of potential borrowers in other countries.
For Grab, the growth in lending so far has come from GXS Bank, its digital bank joint venture with Singtel in Singapore. Notably, its digital bank in Malaysia, GXBank, has yet to make any loan products since its launch in November 2023, while its digital bank in Indonesia is not fully launched.
See also: GrabPay’s retreat is GXS Bank’s gain
During the question and answer session with analysts in the company’s latest earnings call, Grab COO Alex Hungate noted that its digital banks in Malaysia and Indonesia will become a “big driver of lending income” consistently once they start to offer loans.
However, since Grab’s digital banks take the form of joint ventures with other shareholders, it will not enjoy the full economic benefit of the returns that these banks generate.
Meanwhile, in addition to Southeast Asia, Sea can also tap on the large population of Brazil, where Shopee is one of the most visited ecommerce platforms.
Last year, Shopee bought the credit arm of Brazilian fintech Blu, which could pave the way for the ecommerce firm to offer credit directly to its customers there. Currently, SeaMoney offers financing options like cash loans to sellers in several markets, including Brazil.

Tony Hou, Sea’s CFO, told analysts during the company’s Q1 2024 earnings call that while its loans in Brazil were still “a relatively smaller share” of its entire loan portfolio, management has “a high expectation” for the market.
But SeaMoney will face formidable competitors in Brazil, including fellow ecommerce platform MercadoLibre and pioneering digital bank Nu. The former announced that it plans to invest US$4.6 billion in Brazil for this year, while the latter originated US$2.4 billion worth of loans in the country in Q1 2024 alone.
On or off
Another area of divergence is how much focus these firms place on lending within the ecosystem compared to off-platform transactions.
Grab has chosen to focus on driving transactions and lending within its ecosystem. To that end, in its most recent quarter, the company announced that it was discontinuing reporting of gross merchandise value for its financial service segment.
The company also noted that 80% of GXS Bank’s flexi loan customers were also Grab users.
In contrast, in Sea CEO and founder Forrest Li’s opening remarks to the firm’s Q1 2024 results, he noted that the company was “seeing strong growth in off-Shopee loans,” which accounted for “over 40%” of its total outstanding consumer and SME loans as of the end of the quarter.
Going forward, Li added that the company sees “further upside to improve our off-Shopee penetration across different markets as we continue to grow.”
See also: Sea’s upbeat outlook on Shopee drives enthusiasm, but can it deliver?
Both approaches have their advantages and drawbacks. Focusing on loans within the ecosystem will enable Grab to have more confidence in the quality of the loans it makes. Since it has unique data on borrowers, Grab could also reduce the risk of potential defaults by collecting repayments owed by a driver directly from their earnings on the platform. However, this comes at the expense of reducing the pool of potential borrowers.
Conversely, while seeking more borrowers outside of the Shopee ecosystem will broaden Sea’s pool of potential customers, it will own less data on these users to base underwriting decisions on.
What could go wrong?
Amid the enthusiasm that the tech players have expressed for their lending businesses, investors should be mindful that a deterioration in economic conditions may lead to an increase in credit losses, which could hit the companies’ bottom lines.
GoTo’s Husted acknowledged that some consumer lending businesses in Indonesia were already seeing increased credit losses. However, he maintained that GoTo was in a “different situation” due to its “good internal process” and a “tactical decision” made in 2023 to keep its lending growth relatively slow.
As a result, the company has not yet seen “any deterioration in credit,” sporting a non-performing loan (NPL) ratio of 1.3% in Q1 2024.
Sea and Grab claimed to enjoy NPL ratios of 1.4% and 2%, respectively, over the same period.
For comparison, the NPL ratio of DBS, Singapore’s biggest bank, was 1.1% in its most recent quarter. Meanwhile, Indonesia’s average NPL ratio as of March 2024 was 2.3%.
Beyond credit
So far, much of the discussion has been centered around the lending opportunity. The other area the tech giants’ fintech businesses are currently operating in is payments. This brings certain cost advantages, but as Grab’s Hungate noted, payments is more of “a utility business.”

Going forward, higher-margin opportunities may lie in asset management or insurtech. GXBank recently announced that it had teamed up with Swiss insurer Zurich to offer affordable insurance in Malaysia, but the initiative seems to be at a preliminary stage.
MercadoLibre has said that “asset management is a good entry door” to its fintech platform. It has over US$5.5 billion in assets under management as of Q1 2024.
Innovation may even take place in the credit business. For example, around 18% of Sea’s outstanding loans in the most recent quarter were classified as off-book, meaning that the funding for the loans was provided by other financial institutions through SeaMoney’s platform.

Some analysts said a small portion of the sovereign wealth fund could be allocated to the local bourse to boost valuations and investor confidence, although at least one felt that there was no need to do so.
To be clear, it is not the first time that market observers have called for funds from GIC – which manages Singapore’s foreign reserves – to be used to lift the stock market’s flagging fortunes.
The Singapore Business Federation raised the topic in 2016, while The Society of Remisiers (Singapore) suggested it earlier this year.

The conversation over whether GIC should expand its portfolio to include the Singapore market resurfaced again after the Financial Times reported last week that SGX is reviewing a document by the Singapore Venture and Private Capital Association that puts forth several proposals to boost the local bourse.
According to the report, one of the proposals is to allow pension and sovereign money to be invested in the stock market.
Two of Singapore’s investment entities – GIC and Temasek – invest their funds into markets, but in different portfolios.
While Temasek’s portfolio includes local listed companies, GIC’s investments are for firms outside Singapore. This is in line with its mandate to preserve and enhance the international purchasing power of the Singapore reserves it manages over the long term.
One of the sources of funds managed by GIC is the proceeds from the Special Singapore Government Securities, in which funding from the Central Provident Fund (CPF) is invested.
Why reconsider now?
RHB analyst Vijay Natarajan said that while Singapore’s gross domestic product has grown “significantly better” than other markets since GIC was set up in 1981, the local stock market has not grown in the same size and vibrancy.
“And that is where I think the opportunity comes, because GIC knows this market better,” said Natarajan.

S Nallakaruppan, president of The Society of Remisiers (Singapore), noted that many local companies were trading below book value, even with Temasek’s investments in the SGX.
Pointing out how the Japanese government’s intervention had helped to improve its market, Nallakaruppan said that as one of the more undervalued markets globally, it was “long overdue” for the Singapore government to step in as well.
However, Cheng Chye Hsern, who heads the investment team at Providend, felt that it “does not make sense” for GIC to step in given that Temasek is already doing so.
Moreover, doing so would run counter to GIC’s mandate, which is to ensure Singapore’s international purchasing power over the long term.
“It cannot be a case of ‘let’s just put the money in and push up the value’,” said Cheng. Instead, the authorities should look to attract “more exciting” companies to list on the SGX to develop a more vibrant market.
This would lead not just sovereign wealth funds, but also fund managers, to consider investing in Singapore, as they can now have access to companies that are not available anywhere else globally, added Cheng.
However, Paul Chew, head of research at Phillip Securities, felt that GIC’s entry would help to “inject new money” into the market.
On a strategic level, if GIC were to invest in local companies, the valuations of these firms can also rise to better reflect their fundamentals, he pointed out.
In turn, these companies can then become acquirers of other businesses, further adding value to the Singapore market. Otherwise, these companies become targets themselves, and investors lose out on the potential value appreciation of the company, said Chew.
Moving the needle with GIC funds
For Natarajan, the aim of investing GIC funds should be to unlock value in the market and boost long-term returns, as well as to inject liquidity and confidence into the market.
He suggested that investing a low, single-digit percentage of GIC’s portfolio funds locally could “sizably move the needle” of the SGX.
Last year, GIC invested 20% to 30% of its portfolio in developed market equities. Allocating a portion of this toward Singapore should not disrupt its overall portfolio and adhere to GIC’s goal of maintaining a diverse investment approach, said Natarajan.
To ensure liquidity and holistic growth across the Singapore market, he said that GIC can create several funds across various sectors such as real estate, technology and renewable energy. These funds should be actively invested with clear objectives, such as unlocking the value of the sector.

To “jump-start” the market, Nallakaruppan suggested that GIC allocate 10% of its portfolio to Singapore equities. In comparison, 54% of Temasek’s portfolio is in companies based in Singapore. Some 28% of Temasek’s portfolio, in terms of underlying assets, is also based in the city-state.
GIC can start off by investing in the FTSE ST Index stocks before broadening its investments to small- and mid-cap stocks, he added.
Chew said that an exchange-traded fund (ETF) focused on small- or mid-cap companies that meet environmental, social, and governance criteria could be set up as part of a public-private partnership.
Having a sovereign wealth fund invest in an ETF, rather than individual stocks, would help to reduce controversy over the choice of companies it chooses to invest in, he pointed out.
Market watchers also disagreed that it could be politically sensitive to invest GIC funds in the local market, given that part of the funds are from the CPF.
They noted that GIC is already investing funds, albeit in overseas markets. So long as the sovereign wealth fund adopted basic investment principles and poured money into worthy companies, there would not be a conflict of interest.
Investing in Singapore would also reduce investment risks as a local sovereign wealth fund such as GIC would know the landscape here better, said Chew.
“There is no better player to unlock the value of this market than a local sovereign fund compared to any other players,” added Natarajan.

Vietnamese electric vehicle maker VinFast hit a snag on the road, with one of its VF 8 electric cars getting into an accident in California last month. This incident led to the deaths of a family of four.
US safety investigators are currently studying the circumstances. TechCrunch reported.
As per the report, a complaint to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) hinted that steering problems, coupled with high speeds, possibly led to the accident. According to the complaint, the vehicle’s owner had previously experienced an uncommanded jerk in steering.
Prior to this incident, there was at least one reported complaint to the NHTSA regarding an unexpected wheel turn, TechCrunch noted.
VinFast debuted in the US in 2023, and its products received criticism from reviewers. In May of last year, the company had to recall some of its EVs due to a software glitch.
It was also reported recently that the firm is being sued in a California court for having not paid rent for a store since last May, which has now accumulated to US$356,000.
VinFast recorded a net loss of US$618.3 million in the first quarter of 2024, which is more than twice its total revenue for the same period. Despite a year-on-year increase, the company’s revenue of US$302.6 million for the quarter represents a 31% decline compared to Q4 2023.

JD.com plans to borrow US$1.5 billion from investors through a convertible senior notes offering due in 2029. The actual borrowing will depend on market conditions and other factors.
The money raised will be used to buy back some of JD.com’s shares, support global business growth, improve the supply chain, and cover day-to-day operational costs.
Early investors will have the option to buy an additional US$225 million in notes within a 30-day period starting from the offering date.
These notes will become JD.com’s senior unsecured obligations, meaning they are a high-priority debt without specific assets backing them. If not converted to stock, redeemed, or bought back by JD.com, they will be due on June 1, 2029.
However, after the announcement of convertible senior notes, the firm’s stock dropped by 3.5%.
JD.com’s board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program recently. This allows the firm to repurchase up to US$3 billion worth of shares over the next three years through March 2027.
The Chinese ecommerce platform recently also announced its quarterly results, which showed a 7% increase in revenue for Q1 2024 compared to the same period last year. Income from operations also reached US$1.1 billion, 20% higher than in the year-ago period.

Hello reader,
I have a friend who freelances for a couple of US-based firms. He’s pretty well-off, at least by our standards. When I asked him how he manages such a comfortable lifestyle, he said, “Earn in dollars, spend in rupees.”
This is the reality for thousands of freelancers in Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh, countries with depreciating currencies and a wealth of soft talent.
The same goes for exporters to the US or other Western countries. Production costs are low, but the selling prices are high. Sometimes, governments even devalue their own currency to keep the country’s businesses profitable.
But there’s a catch. To grow further, these markets need investments, and investors need profits. In developing countries with unstable currencies, investments can be risky.
If investors put money into the market, they have to beat inflation and currency depreciation to make a profit. The latter is what today’s premium story focuses on – how do VC firms deal with rapidly depreciating currencies when investing in emerging markets?
Today we look at:

Premium summary
Can savvy VCs outsmart currency depreciation in emerging markets?

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Emerging markets have long struggled to gain investors’ trust due to many factors, one of which being the fast depreciation of their currencies. However, by investing in high-growth tech startups early on, VC firms can capitalize on the strong economic growth and tech optimism in these regions, generating returns that outpace currency depreciation.


Venture edge: Venture capital’s high-risk, high-reward model is well-suited to emerging markets. While several factors can inhibit growth, investments in rapidly expanding sectors can achieve returns that outstrip both currency depreciation and traditional investment options in these regions.

Prime path: Successful VC investment in emerging markets hinges on identifying “primed markets.” These refer to markets where macro conditions can give rise to tech startups that can dominate their respective local verticals.

Investor evolution: Emerging markets are attracting diverse investors, including tech-savvy heirs of local conglomerates and large institutional investors seeking to shake up their portfolios. These markets also have a unique founder landscape, with a blend of foreign-educated founders with startup expertise and locally trained founders with deep market knowledge.

Snowflake contemplates billion-dollar scoop of SG-based AI startup

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Cloud data platform Snowflake is reportedly eyeing a US$1 billion acquisition of Reka AI, a startup developing its own large language models.


Strategic acquisition: This strategic move aims to enhance Snowflake’s AI capabilities and expand its generative AI offerings.

Reka AI’s expertise: The firm specializes in large language models with applications in customer support and content generation. Reka AI has already garnered attention and investment, including from Snowflake itself, in its US$58 million funding round in 2023.

Market dynamics: The potential acquisition comes at a time when Snowflake’s revenue growth is slowing down due to reduced software spending by businesses. By incorporating Reka AI’s technology, Snowflake can potentially revitalize its growth trajectory and tap into the rising demand for AI-powered solutions.

Global investment firm KKR has acquired a minority stake in Infinx, an Indian machine learning- and AI-powered healthtech firm.
While the financial details weren’t disclosed, a Moneycontrol report cited sources saying that KKR invested around US$150 million for the deal. According to a statement, the investment comes from KKR’s Asian Fund IV.
Norwest Venture Partners, already a shareholder in Infinx, also took part in this deal.
Established in 2012 by Sandeep Tandon and Jaideep Tandon, Infinx offers data-driven revenue cycle management (RCM) solutions tailored for the healthcare industry. These help healthcare providers process clearance and give pay estimates for patients, as well as check their benefits, among others.
Infinx also said it helps ensure accurate claims are submitted the first time around and maximize reimbursements for care providers.
Its RCM solutions cater to over 172,000 healthcare professionals across 4,000 facilities, encompassing ambulatory, acute care, and post-acute care providers, per the statement.
The company’s clientele is said to comprise 400 leading healthcare provider organizations, including hospitals, health systems, and outpatient healthcare providers.
Infinx mainly focuses on the US market, where healthcare spending reached around US$4.3 trillion in 2022. This investment aims to accelerate the company’s growth, expand its network, and support further acquisitions.
Recently, KKR also agreed to acquire India-based medical devices company Healthium Medtech for US$839 million.
Aiming to take a controlling stake in Healthium, the investment firm will complete the acquisition through a special-purpose vehicle owned by KKR-controlled funds.

Hello there,
It’s been almost 20 years since I graduated law school, but a lot of what I learned there has come in handy in my years as a journalist.
Criminal law? Check. Business law? Check. Criminals in business law? Check and check.
But in all that time, I don’t think I’ve ever used anything that I learned in contract law. I still remember some of it, and what I remember was not fun.
What I remember most is my law professor confusing the hell out of me by arguing in circles on whether something was or was not a contract.
The experience apparently scarred me so much I actually winced when I read my colleague Candice’s Big Story about Hearti Lab.
The company, which aimed at using blockchain and AI technology to offer insurance to those who usually can’t get insured, is being wound up. Unfortunately, Web3 companies shutting their doors isn’t that uncommon, but a number of Hearti’s investors are upset because of the contracts they claim they made with Hearti’s founder, Keith Lim.
The story is a lesson in the importance of founders and investors knowing the difference between what is and what isn’t a binding agreement.
In our second Big Story of the week, my colleague Peter looks at the rise of cleantech, which is shaping up to be the next hot market for tech investors in Indonesia. The sector has raised US$77.5 million so far this year.
And finally, I’ll tell you about the protests and anger being directed at companies using AI. Spoiler alert: A lot of people are afraid they’re going to lose their jobs, and some are already starting to point fingers.

AI ODYSSEY
Promising AI projects we’re noticing
Protests and AI anger grow as Google wrecks the internet
Science fiction writers had it all wrong. The villains of the AI world aren’t who you think they are.
Most Hollywood-style movies portray villains as unscrupulous, often military-based, technology-focused companies that create equally unscrupulous murder bots like Skynet or Ultron. But in the real world, instead of developing military applications, the villains are focused on – check notes – advertising, healthcare, and firms looking to cut costs in the workplace, just to name a few.
Why are we calling them villains? Because heroes don’t usually face this much anger.
In a series of protests over the past week, many people around the world have voiced their frustration not with the technology, but what the companies are doing with it.
At a strike in California last week, nurses were upset that their employer, Kaiser Permanente – the state’s second-largest employer – was moving too fast in bringing generative AI into the healthcare industry. Nurses argued that this was being done at a speed that could endanger patients and possibly threaten jobs.
While it was almost never in the headlines, every story eventually turns to job security. If you want to know who the villains are, look for the people whose jobs aren’t on the line.

Of course, in some situations, the people making the AI and using it to threaten jobs are the same. Google, which has drawn numerous comparisons to Skynet over the years, became the focus of much of the week’s anger following the company’s AI-heavy announcements at its annual I/O conference.
The company introduced an AI-enhanced Google search that will do our googling for us. It may sound harmless, but the technology has the potential to disrupt just about everything we know about the web.
With this newest iteration of Google, the popular search engine would no longer offer a list of related websites. Instead, when people ask Google a question, the software will conduct the search in the background, scrape the data, and then provide an analysis of what it finds using genAI.
No more clicking through websites. Google will handle it all, which means it will have unprecedented control over our news, travel plans, digital content, and even, uh, adult entertainment. This move could turn the company that opened the internet to billions just 20 years ago into a walled garden, reminiscent of America Online circa 2000.
Even that may not seem so bad, until you remember how Google earns its money, which includes taking money from customers who want to have search results ranked higher.
A recent article suggests that the use of “affiliate marketing” was so prolific that it was hurting the quality of Google’s search results. Basically, the summary you get could all be based on paid content.
Think you can avoid this by using an alternative search engine? Google commanded a 88% market share in search, as of 2022. Microsoft is currently the second-largest player in web search, with a market share of about 6.5%.
Microsoft has invested a total of US$13 billion into OpenAI, which already has Bing integrated with ChatGPT. The largest company without an AI-search product is Yahoo, which controls a paltry 2% of the market.
Will people care? Casey Newton over at Platformer said it best. “I suspect billions of people will be happy to receive their answers to complicated queries directly on the search results page, uninterested in where the information comes from, so long as it’s accurate enough.”
That could spell bad news for small companies and startups that may now need to pay their way into your AI search. Under the old Google search, diligent researchers could find information on even the smallest startups. Now it remains to be seen if readers will even bother looking beyond what the AI offers.

Singapore-based property portal PropertyGuru posted a narrower net loss of S$6.3 million (US$4.6 million) for the first quarter of 2024, as compared to the US$7.5 million net loss it recorded in the same period last year.
This comes after the New York Stock Exchange-listed firm made positive earnings for the previous two quarters.
Revenue for the quarter rose 11.9% to US$27 million on the back of a strong growth in its Singapore marketplace segment.
Basic loss per share for the period stood as US$0.03, as compared to US$0.045 loss per share in the year-ago quarter. Meanwhile, adjusted EBITDA rose to US$3.3 million from US$163,000 in Q1 2023.
Fintech and data services revenue stood at US$742,000 for Q1 2024, down 3% year on year. On the other hand, marketplaces revenue increased by 13% to US$25.9 million over the same period, as strong results in Singapore offset a slower recovery in Vietnam and Malaysia.
Singapore marketplaces revenue was up 25% year on year to US$17.4 million, driven by growth in both the number of agents and the average revenue per agent.
Malaysia marketplaces revenue stood at US$4.9 million, as compared to US$5 million in the first quarter last year. Explaining the decline, the company said that property pricing remains elevated relative to consumer expectations, shifting the focus to rental listings in the near term.
Hari Krishnan, CEO and managing director of PropertyGuru, noted that despite near-term challenges, the company expects a positive outlook for the Malaysian market on a reviving property-buying sentiment based on its consumer survey.
Meanwhile, Vietnam marketplaces revenue was almost flat year over year at US$2.4 million in Q1 2024, as a 13% increase in the average revenue per listing was offset by a 13% decrease in listings amid a sustained market weakness.
“In Vietnam, we are seeing a gradual improvement in the property market toward the end of the quarter, with listings on our platform hitting a 12-month high in March,” said Krishnan.
Joe Dische, the company’s CFO, highlighted “selective hiring and focused investment” for the remainder of 2024.
“We plan to continue to invest in automation, leverage our existing technologies and generative AI to both provide superior customer experiences and manage our cost base as we drive continued revenue growth. Our full-year revenue outlook of US$122 million to US$133 million and full-year adjusted EBITDA outlook of US$16.3 million to US$19.2 million are unchanged,” Dische added.

Microsoft has unveiled Copilot+PC, a new personal computer featuring a distinct AI chip for quicker processing.
In an interview with Bloomberg, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that with this new computer line, the company aims to step up competition between Windows PCs and Apple’s Macs.
Nadella claimed Copilot+PC could outshine Apple’s MacBook Air M3 by a substantial 58%. The new hardware is set for distribution starting June 18, with a starting price of US$1,000.
However, Microsoft’s partnership with AI research lab OpenAI is under scrutiny from regulators in locations like Europe, the US, and the UK. There’s a debate on whether such AI investments could impede competition or need to be regulated like merger deals.
In response, Nadella said that partnerships like its tie-up with OpenAI are actually driving competition in the fast-growing AI field.
Microsoft is doubling down on its investments in AI across markets including in Southeast Asia. In April, Nadella visited several countries in the region to announce this commitment.
The tech giant plans to invest US$1.7 billion in Indonesia and US$2.2 billion in Malaysia to build AI infrastructure. Microsoft also said it will provide AI training and support to 2.5 million people in Southeast Asia by 2025.

In his first speech following the inauguration, Wong listed several priorities for his government, including adapting the city-state to a new world order, ensuring that its people keep pace with technological advancements, and strengthening the social compact.

Founders, investors, and academics also have their own wishlist. They say that the new leadership must also consider how Singapore can maintain its competitive edge, sustain its attractiveness as a destination for capital and talent amid the rising cost of living, and potentially rethink manpower policies that have made it difficult for many tech startups to hire and sustain growth.
Many of these decisions, though, involve difficult trade-offs that Wong and his cabinet will have to agonize over.
The thorny issue of talent
Singapore ranked eighth on a global list of startup ecosystems in 2023, hailed for having a high concentration of billion-dollar companies and its connectivity to the world. In 2022, an index released by the Asian Development Bank said that Singapore had the world’s best digital environment and support system for entrepreneurs.
The city-state’s stellar scores on countless global rankings, however, can mask deeper issues.
The shortage of talent has been “a bottleneck” for companies, Mohammad Sherafatmand, CEO and founder of deeptech firm Hydroleap, tells Tech in Asia.
The shortfall has been particularly acute in areas requiring technical and operational expertise, he notes. His startup, which uses electrochemical techniques to treat industrial wastewater, can “barely find” automation engineers in Singapore. And even when it does, hiring locals is extremely expensive.

Hiring a foreigner from another country for the same role, however, would entail applying for an employment pass (EP), which comes with a minimum qualifying salary of S$5,000 (US$3,700). That number will go up to S$5,600 (US$4,200) by January 2025, when new guidelines are implemented.
This policy, however, might not be politically easy to reverse.
By raising minimum salary requirements for foreign professionals, the government had hoped to incentivize firms to prioritize hiring locals amid public discontent over perceived competition for job opportunities stemming from an influx of foreigners.
The inflow of wealthy immigrants, which contributed to higher property prices in Singapore during the pandemic, remains a thorny issue.
Getting junior software engineers has been a particular pain point because of the small pool of local talent, notes Jussi Salovaara, co-founder and managing partner in Asia for Antler. The Singapore-based VC firm is a “day zero” investor that backs early-stage startups all the way till series C rounds.
While there’s a shortfall of such talent in Singapore, Salovaara observes that many companies have little choice but to overpay for junior engineers because their counterparts in overseas markets don’t meet EP requirements at market salary rates. Or they end up hiring senior engineers instead to fill junior roles.
Even though it’s “completely understandable” to protect fresh graduates as a policy, this creates challenges for hiring technical talent, Salovaara tells Tech in Asia. The constant upward adjustments also makes the situation worse.
He cites an AI startup in Antler’s portfolio that recently shifted its base from Singapore to Vietnam as an example. “It’s lower burn, especially in the early stage, when they don’t have a lot of capital, [and] easier to get junior tech people … Nothing in their business is geographically oriented; they are also not Singaporean or Vietnamese,” Salovaara notes.
Aaron Tan, CEO and co-founder of automotive marketplace Carro, thinks a review of the EP system is needed to alleviate the talent deficiency in Singapore at the market salary rates.

He pointed out a mismatch between what companies want to pay for labor and what locals think they’re worth, and a general unwillingness among them to work in roles including bookkeeping and customer service.
High costs pricing out skilled labor
Cost remains top of mind for investors, founders, and employees alike.
“The high cost of living is a challenge when getting founders and employees to come in,” says Antler’s Salovaara.
“One problem Singapore has is that unless you make it big, you’re going to struggle,” explains Nitin Pangarkar, associate professor at the National University of Singapore (NUS) Business School.
Purchasing a house, for instance, could be a problem. “If the [government] raises the additional buyer’s stamp duty with the intention that foreigners shouldn’t buy, that same thing makes foreigners think [Singapore] can’t be a long-term option,” Pangarkar notes.
If you have global aspirations, the competition is the US and other big countries.
Singapore’s high land and energy costs also make it an expensive place to base manufacturing.
That’s one of the reasons why Hydropleap is considering more “cost-effective” options overseas as it develops its manufacturing capabilities, particularly since it’s planning to expand its solution for clients including Amazon Web Services across Asia Pacific.
A fast-eroding competitive edge
Carro’s Tan worries that Singaporeans – like any workforce – are losing their competitive edge with the increased usage of generative AI and robotics.
While a higher education level as well as proficiency in English and a Mother Tongue language used to be advantages, technologies like genAI are fast eroding that edge.
With genAI tools, “you technically don’t even have to [be able to] speak in English,” Tan notes.
Antler’s Salovaara, however, believes Singapore’s “traditional” competitive advantages – from stability in legislation and regulation to rule of law and safety – continue to make the city-state a “great place to build a company,” specifically when compared to other Southeast Asian countries. Its status as a financial hub is also a strong draw.
While Singapore does well versus Indonesia or Thailand, they are not the competition “if you have global aspirations,” Pangarkar of NUS notes. Instead, “the competition is the US and other big [countries],” the professor adds.

Singapore is “probably the easiest” city in the world for foreign founders to enter and join its program, according to Salovaara. That’s thanks to the EntrePass system, which allows founders who are not Singaporeans or permanent residents (PRs) to enter the country and build companies without first being employed.
“Enterprise Singapore has been a partner that supports any founder that works with us to get an EntrePass … that has been of supreme value.” he adds. That policy “should obviously be kept,” Salovaara says.
Other governments, however, are following suit to woo entrepreneurs.
For instance, Thailand’s Smart S visa allows tech startup entrepreneurs who have established a company in industries specified by the kingdom to work without a work permit.
“It’s going to be interesting to see how that develops and if people end up going to Thailand, particularly from the point of view of the high cost of living [in Singapore],” Salovaara says.
The remarkable success of Singapore Inc.
Policies including public-private partnerships targeting early-stage startup funding and scholarships designed to bring in talent from abroad have helped shape Singapore’s tech scene into what it is today. Tech clusters like Block71, which were designed to mimic the entrepreneurial buzz and network effects of Silicon Valley, have also contributed to the ecosystem.
“One good thing about Singapore is that when something comes from the top, you can see the change of mandate in most of the [government] agencies. That’s great for moving programs ahead,” Hydroleap’s Sherafatmand notes.
Without Block71, Carousell, 99.co, and ShopBack might not have existed.
The Iranian founder arrived in Singapore on a scholarship in 2012 to pursue a doctorate degree. While he did not plan on staying after graduation, his experience collaborating with agencies like the Public Utilities Board and Temasek-owned renewables firm Sembcorp and meeting his life partner – a Singaporean – eventually led him to change his mind.
Government support from SGInnovate and Seeds Capital, the investment arm of Enterprise Singapore, were critical to Hydroleap, especially in its early years. “If it wasn’t for the initial support that SGInnovate gave, both financially as well as non-financially, Hydroleap probably would have struggled so much,” Sherafatmand says.

Similarly, Carro’s Tan says that “without Block71, Carousell, 99.co, and ShopBack might not have existed.” Together with NUS Enterprise, he established Block71 in 2011, during his stint with Singtel Innov8 as associate director.
He pointed out that JFDI, a startup accelerator that was active between 2010 and 2015, and inventory management platform TradeGecko, might also not have existed. TradeGecko was acquired by US software firm Intuit for a reported US$80 million in 2020.
“What is remarkable about the early initiatives for Singapore’s tech sector is that they did not only sell Singapore’s growth potential, but critically the Southeast Asia story,” Yinglan Tan, founding managing partner at Insignia Ventures Partners, tells Tech in Asia.
Between 2008 and 2015, Singapore’s government seeded some S$150 million (US$111 million) across three rounds through the Early Stage Venture Fund (ESVF) scheme.
Under the scheme, the government also matched investments with select VC firms – Golden Gate Ventures, Jungle Ventures, and Monk’s Hill Ventures, among others – on a one-to-one basis, serving the dual purpose of de-risking startup investments and encouraging corporate venture funds to establish themselves in the city-state.
This highlighted the ease of doing business in the city-state, Insignia’s Tan notes. It also drew businesses from across Asia to set up their headquarters in Singapore and domicile here.
With overall funding levels in Singapore showing a year-on-year drop in 2023, particularly for startups in later stages, is this time to consider a second installment of the ESVF?
Insignia’s Tan notes that the startup ecosystem in Singapore has matured, going beyond attracting talent and capital to build companies to scaling companies globally and preparing them for public markets. At this stage, “there are more variables outside of the government’s control,” he observes.
The government can still play a role, however. For instance, it could work with other countries to co-invest in regional champions, he suggests.
Making a dent in deep tech
Questions remain over Singapore’s ability to build successful firms in deep tech – a keen focus for the government – given the lack of talent in this field.
Hydroleap’s Sherafatmand, however, is optimistic. “Singapore knows that it doesn’t have the biggest talent pool, but if they work on the technology side, build intellectual property around that, that’s something valuable.”
But growing the ecosystem will not be easy.
“The challenge for Singapore is that most customers for deeptech companies are in the US, Europe, Japan, and other countries that are either more used to the technology being sold or have greater willingness to pay for such solutions,” Insignia’s Tan contends.

This will inevitably encourage local firms to shift their headquarters as they scale, or deprioritize investments into Southeast Asia, he points out.
Antler’s Salovaara hopes to see public-private partnerships in which the government helps seed a few deeptech funds, particularly in the early stages, when international capital is lacking.
“To get more companies into the system … it’s all about seed funding,” he stresses. While generalist investors like Antler currently fill that gap, having “specialist funds” at the seed stage would improve the overall ecosystem.
You’re not going to get cancer or Alzheimer’s treatments coming out of Singapore.
Sherafatmand agrees that more can be done to support both early-stage and growth-stage companies.
“Most of the funds that can help deeptech companies to grow are foreign funds,” he says. The few Singapore-based funds that focus on deep tech are either too early-stage to move the needle or focus on late-stage companies hitting northwards of S$30 million (US$22.3 million) in revenue.
Winning games
Sherafatmand would like Singapore’s new government to double down on emerging areas like sustainability, especially as it relates to specific needs in areas like power or water.
NUS professor Pangarkar thinks Singapore should continue to focus on niches like medtech or agritech and “playing the games that it can win.”
“You’re not going to get cancer or Alzheimer’s treatments coming out of Singapore because there just is not a deep enough market. But you’re going to see some niche areas in which Singapore can flourish,” he explains.
That said, the Singapore government “has done a better job than any other government globally to support the local ecosystem,” Salovaara says. “That is a significant source of value. I hope with the new leadership, that continues, because many governments are upping their game,” he adds.

If language is no longer a moat for Singapore, what would make for a new one? Carro’s Tan believes that the answer lies in a globally minded population, one that’s well-attuned to the world and has operating experience and a good understanding of overseas markets.
He adds that revamping the formal education system to expedite the process of obtaining a diploma or degree, and reducing the service length for males in the National Service, could also go a long way.
“If you want to train more talent, more entrepreneurs, you need to shorten the education time because the [opportunity] cost is too high. If you work backwards on age, males are two years older than everyone else – it doesn’t allow that environment to fail,” Carro’s Tan says.
“I firmly believe starting young increases our odds of success,” he adds.

Indonesia’s GoTo Group has unveiled plans for its upcoming annual general meeting and extraordinary general meeting of shareholders, which involves proposed shifts in the firm’s top management.
Co-founder William Tanuwijaya and director Melissa Siska Juminto have completed their terms on GoTo’s board. Meanwhile, former Gojek co-CEO Andre Soelistyo is set to step down from his role on the board “to pursue other interests.” It is unclear how involved Soelistyo will be in GoTo’s operations moving forward.
Additionally, the company plans to make CEO Patrick Walujo eligible to hold series B shares while ensuring no dilution for current shareholders as no new series B shares will be issued.
John Prasetio, the president commissioner of the Indonesian Stock Exchange, is expected to become an independent commissioner at GoTo. He will succeed Robert Holmes Swan, who was appointed in 2021.
Moreover, the company will discuss the US$200 million share buyback program that it announced earlier this year. The scheme will undergo regular checks and potential revisions by the company’s leadership, GoTo said in a statement.
“Cash flow is improving, and as there is significant value in our stock, we believe a buyback is prudent as we look to ensure we are using our resources efficiently,” said Walujo.
GoTo recorded an 89% year-on-year improvement in adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2024, reporting an adjusted loss of US$6.2 million.

They’ve been facing short-term challenges in the form of rising business costs – due largely in part to higher taxes and inflation – as well as long-term consumer-focused considerations such as improving sustainability, digitalization, and expanding to new markets.

According to a DBS survey on local businesses, 42% of respondents said that they were worried about rising business costs while 43% ranked “ensuring consistent cash flow and managing costs” as their top priority this year.
To navigate this reality, banks – providing additional support in the form of capital and more – have emerged as an important partner to help firms achieve their long-term goals while minimizing the short-term impact of rising costs.
A greener path
One of the biggest long-term issues on local business leaders’ minds is going green, especially since the Singapore government has a plan in place to achieve net zero by 2050.
However, this green transition can be expensive. It’s estimated that the cost of reaching the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals will amount to a staggering US$195 trillion.
Add on the fact that business owners without relevant sustainability experience may not have the expertise to initiate these transformations, on top of the significant time investment and resources needed.
To assist businesses in sustainable transformation, DBS – together with Enterprise Singapore – launched the ESG Ready Programme earlier this year.
Much of the program is about supporting businesses through a holistic approach, such as by providing foundational training, advice, and support to Singapore businesses regarding sustainability. It will also offer preferential financing rates to alleviate some of the costs associated with developing and adopting green business practices.
“The ESG Ready Programme aims to help companies remove the guesswork by laying out a comprehensive roadmap with clear steps and relevant solutions, making it easier for them to take action,” Koh Kar Siong, DBS group head of corporate and SME banking, said in a statement.

Apart from this program, the bank also works directly with local businesses to support a green transition across their entire operations. One example is its partnership with local supermarket chain Sheng Siong.
The two entities are collaborating to engage up to 1,000 SMEs in Sheng Siong’s supply chain network, with DBS ultimately looking to introduce a sustainability program to help said SMEs identify, develop, and implement decarbonization plans. Further, the bank will organize upskilling courses and introduce green solutions to the firms it engages.
“It’s all about providing timely and tangible support by building an ecosystem of public- and private-sector partners,” Koh says.
Exploring new borders
Banks can also be a key partner to boost businesses’ international expansion goals, which is a key priority for more than 60% of them.
However, if the business isn’t familiar with local consumers or doesn’t have the right partner, the first step of international expansion could be challenging to navigate.
However, banks make the perfect intermediary to help SMEs bridge the gap.
DBS, for instance, has a network of services across Asia, with a strong presence in India, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Indonesia, and Singapore. As such, businesses looking to break into these new markets could turn to the bank to understand the local situation better or even work with it to enter the market effectively.

The bank currently has 100 locations in India – up from the previous figure of 28 – following its amalgamation with Lakshmi Vilas Bank.
Over in China, DBS increased its stake in Shenzhen Rural Commercial Bank to 16.69% last year, allowing it to support stronger digital transformation in the Greater Bay Area, as well as offer banking solutions for businesses looking to operate within the region.
“With our extensive regional footprint and comprehensive network outside of Singapore, this allows us to connect clients to regional and global opportunities to support their growth and expansion ambitions,” says Koh.
Staying nimble
Last but not least, staying adaptable should always be a key long-term goal for any business. As the saying goes, “adapt or die.”
In this area, banks make important partners because they’ve also got an extremely diverse set of offerings. If business owners can’t always predict what’s coming in the years ahead – and it’s unlikely that most could do it with a high level of accuracy – then it’s a good idea to work with a partner that can provide the right solutions for almost any contingency.
It’s all about providing timely and tangible support by building an ecosystem of public- and private-sector partners
For the all-important digitalization of operations, for instance, they could turn to DBS, which offers a suite of digital solutions. It includes anything from online HR and payroll capabilities to cybersecurity solutions, which aim to improve efficiency in day-to-day operations.
Another example: Perhaps a local mom and pop store has decided that they need to bolster their insurance coverage. This, too, is something that banks have in their arsenal. Case in point: the Heartland Merchant Banking Package from DBS, which includes insurance coverage – with a fee waiver of up to one year – on top of other solutions, such as accounts that don’t require a minimum balance and can make unlimited local transfers for free.
Overall, these measures are designed to support local businesses’ cash flows.
Anticipating the next few years
The partnership between banks and businesses to help the latter hit their long-term goals will only continue to evolve as time goes on.
Koh says that with DBS, the intention is to continue establishing meaningful collaborations and developing ecosystems of partners to help these small and medium-sized businesses.
“It’s a big world out there, and businesses really don’t have to go at it alone. There’s always different types of support available for firms to meet short-term challenges while achieving long-term goals,” he says. “We hope that knowing this, business owners can achieve whatever they set out to do.”
Currency converted from Singapore dollar to US dollar: US$1 = S$1.37.

Doubao, ByteDance’s ChatGPT-like offering, has eclipsed Baidu’s Ernie Bot to become the most popular AI chatbot in China, according to a Bloomberg report that cited Sensor Tower data.
Launched in August 2023, Doubao has outpaced Ernie in terms of downloads and now has more regular monthly users on Apple’s iOS. Doubao has logged almost 9 million downloads – a million more than Ernie – in the year through April. Doubao also has over 4 million monthly users in China.
ByteDance says that its AI chatbot has 26 million active users on mobile and PC in China. In comparison, OpenAI’s ChatGPT mobile app has racked up 6.7 million monthly US users.
Beyond Duobao, ByteDance is also leaving its footprint in other generative AI applications. Gauth, an “AI homework helper” from ByteDance subsidiary GauthTech, became the second-most downloaded education app in the US in April, behind only Duolingo.
Only Baidu’s Ernie offers a paid subscription among the leading AI chatbots in China. But since March 2023, Ernie has earned less than US$500,000 from subscriptions and app purchases, according to Sensor Tower data.
As such, advertising and cloud services could drive more growth for Ernie, potentially bringing in billions more in yuan this year.
Apple is also reportedly in early-stage talks with Baidu about incorporating the latter’s genAI technology into the its products in China.

Elon Musk is said to be considering an offer to set up an Indonesian factory for electric vehicle batteries after a meeting between the Tesla CEO and President Joko Widodo, Reuters reported, citing a remark by senior cabinet minister Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan.
Pandjaitan – who is the country’s coordinating minister for maritime affairs and investment – said the government “made an offer” and asked Musk whether it would be possible “to build an EV battery plant here,” more specifically for the production of cathode precursors.
“And he will consider it,” added Pandjaitan.
Indonesia has long been trying to woo Musk into investing in the country. In March last year, its government launched an incentive program for manufacturers looking to invest in the local EV market, as well as for EV retailers and individuals aiming to switch to electric.
The government of Indonesia aims to get Tesla involved in building EV factories, hoping to use the country’s nickel reserves to grow the EV industry.
According to Pandjaitan, President Widodo also suggested that Musk set up an AI center in Indonesia and that his company SpaceX build a launchpad in Biak, an island in the Papua province.
SpaceX also recently launched Starlink, its satellite internet service, mainly for Indonesia’s health sector. While the service is available for commercial use, the Indonesian government aims to prioritize remote and underdeveloped areas first.
Approximately 60% of nearly 7,500 satellites currently orbiting Earth belong to SpaceX.

We break down the big and messy topics of Asia’s tech and startup community. Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a premium subscription.
Hello reader,
Here at Tech in Asia, our business development team works hard to bring in the dough. I’ve seen them on back-to-back calls, their inboxes filled to bursting with email after email. I’ve even helped them with proposals to prospective clients, staring in awe at the detailed slide decks they put together.
They’re an important part of the company, and I admire them and their tenacity, because I could never. When I worked at a shoe shop as a teenager, my sales figures were always one of the lowest because “if you don’t want to buy, then don’t buy I guess” was my approach to the job. That’s how I learned that I’m rubbish at sales, and I started doing other things, which have led to me writing this newsletter.
Where I’m going with this is that the sales life is a tough life, and their commissions are often structured as such to incentivize and motivate them to keep hustling despite the challenges that come their way. However, sometimes conflicts arise between employee and employer over these commissions – and things can get pretty gnarly, as we learn in today’s premium story.
Today we look at:

Fintech firm Rapyd’s legal tussle with an ex-employee over unpaid commissions

AI company Sqreem’s latest acquisition
Other newsy highlights such as Golden Gate Ventures’ new fund in the Middle East and India’s newest unicorn


Premium summary
A curious case of commissions

Image credit: Timmy Loen

A former salesperson of UK-based payments unicorn Rapyd is suing the firm for over $1.1 million in unpaid commissions, which the company is contesting.


Not counted: Rapyd CEO and co-founder Arik Shtilman alleges that transactions by a client brought in by the former employee were “round-tripping,” which meant that they were only done to boost the number of transactions in the platform. He also contended that these transactions, which amounted to US$934 million from two clients, were ineligible for commissions due to the terms of the company’s compensation plan. Meanwhile, the ex-salesperson said in his affidavit that the supposed instances of “round-tripping” were valid transactions as the clients were moving their own funds using Rapyd’s products, which include a multicurrency treasury.

Negotiations not going well: Both parties negotiated over the commissions from August 29 to December 4 in 2022. The ex-employee held fast to his demands to be paid US$1.1 million, and he alleges that a deal was made during the August 29 meeting. Shtilman, however, claimed no resolution had been reached during that meeting.

Rising star: Rapyd was valued at US$15 billion in 2022. After announcing a series E round worth US$300 million in August 2021, it launched an extensive marketing campaign to recruit employees. Amid hosting lavish recruitment events, the company was reportedly preparing to lay off 10% of its workforce in 2022 and was involved in other wage and commission disputes.

Things are TotallyAwesome right now, I could Sqreem

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Singapore-based AI company Sqreem Technologies has acquired TotallyAwesome, a digital ad platform in the city-state that’s focused on marketing to Asia-Pacific youth.


I Sqreem, you Sqreem: Founded in 2006, Sqreem provides AI-powered B2B solutions that can be used to analyze digital behavior. Meanwhile, TotallyAwesome helps its clients build digital microsites, games, and quizzes for young audiences.

A totally awesome partnership: The deal aims to combine Sqreem’s AI tech with TotallyAwesome’s user base to create “precision-targeted web environments for young users and their families,” said the two companies. Sqreem also expects the acquisition to help it navigate ethical youth marketing amid rising global debates on responsible AI usage.

Making moves: This extends Sqreem’s acquisition streak – it acquired Australia-based advertising firm Trade Indy in March.

Quick bytes
1️⃣ A golden gate to the Middle East
Singapore-headquartered VC firm Golden Gate Ventures has announced the first close of its US$100 million fund in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Called the MENA Fund 1, it is based in Qatar and reportedly has US$20 million in commitments.
2️⃣ Welcome to the unicorn club 🦄
Porter, an India-based logistics startup, recently conducted a friends and family funding round, in which it was valued at US$1 billion. While it is rare to charge a higher share price in secondary transactions as compared to institution-led rounds, the premium may be a reflection of Porter’s recent performance – revenue reached US$21.1 million in 2023, up from US$10.2 million the previous year.
3️⃣ The AI opportunity
Search engine firm Baidu recorded US$4.4 billion in revenue for the first quarter of 2024, which was only a 1% increase year on year. However, its AI Cloud business outpaced overall growth, contributing to a 6% year-on-year increase in non-online market revenue to US$935 million.
4️⃣ Ecommerce going strong
From one Chinese tech giant to another – ecommerce platform JD.com reported US$36 billion in revenue for Q1 2024, growing 7% compared to Q1 2023. CEO Sandy Xu attributed this to a “focus on user experience,” which helped to drive “strong growth in the number of active users as well as user engagement.”
5️⃣ Merger maybe
Indonesian telcos XL Axiata and Smartfren are in early talks of a potential merger, the companies said in a statement. The deal, which can potentially create a US$3.5 billion entity, seeks to leverage Axiata Group’s telco expertise with Sinar Mas’ local scale and market knowledge.
6️⃣ London-bound … or not
Fast-fashion retailer Shein has reportedly been considering holding its IPO in London instead of New York, which comes amid rising geopolitical tensions between China and the US. However, executive chairman Donald Tang declined to confirm the plans in a recent interview, saying that the company wants to “explore all options.”","We look at the ongoing legal tussle between the fintech firm and an ex-employee, as well as explore AI company Sqreem’s latest acquisition.",Stefanie Yeo,Editing by Lorenzo Kyle Subido,open,0,"",https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/1715939262_Newsletter-GIF-A-curious-case-of-commissions-1200x640-1.gif,false,"",false,true,false,true,false,5,,1084,The $1.1m dispute between Rapyd and a former salesperson,"We look at the ongoing legal tussle between the fintech firm and an ex-employee, as well as explore AI company Sqreem’s latest acquisition.",,,"","",""

Photo credit: Pine Labs

Pine Labs, a merchant platform, has secured a Singapore court approval to move its operations in the city-state to India, TechCrunch reported, citing a regulatory filing. It aims to merge its entities in Singapore and India, effectively transferring assets and resources.
According to the regulatory filing, the transfer will help Pine Labs “achieve business synergies and more economies of scale,” among other benefits. These can drive the firm’s efforts for high operational efficiency.
The company joins other top Indian startups like Meesho, Razorpay, Udaan, and PhonePe that are also relocating or have relocated their overseas branches back to India.
An investor focused in Indian companies told TechCrunch that this trend may come from the fact that companies with valuations below US$20 billion get less coverage from analysts in developed markets, resulting in lower demand from institutional investors.
However, the investor noted that in India, tech companies can often raise more capital due to high demand for their services.
With a valuation worth over US$5 billion, Pine Labs is backed by investors like Peak XV, Temasek, and PayPal. In 2022, the merchant platform acquired Singapore-based fintech firm Fave in a US$45 million deal.

Alibaba has poured another US$230 million into its Southeast Asia-focused ecommerce platform Lazada, according to data from Alternatives.pe, which tracks filings in Singapore.
With this, the Chinese tech giant has poured a total of roughly US$7.7 billion into Lazada since 2016, when it invested US$1 billion into the Shopee rival to take a controlling stake.
This would also mark Alibaba’s first injection into Lazada this year. In 2023, the former invested over US$1.8 billion into the latter.
The new funding comes as ecommerce players in Southeast Asian turn to lower costs to get ahead of their competition. Lazada in particular launched its Choice offering last year, a platform that goes toe-to-toe with Temu and Shein in terms of low-cost offerings.
Before this, Alibaba said the Choice platform helped AliExpress – its global ecommerce marketplace – log over 60% order growth in the quarter ending December 2023 compared to the previous quarter. This trend continued for the quarter ending March this year.
Earlier this year, co-founder Jack Ma told Alibaba’s staff in a letter that the company has taken “a surgical approach to cure the ailments of a large company.”
This follows Alibaba taking a back seat to Pinduoduo parent PDD Holdings last year in terms of shares. Since then, the former made efforts to simplify its business structure and boost efficiency, such as increasing synergies between logistics arm Cainiao and its ecommerce business.

SpaceX has launched Starlink, its satellite internet service, for Indonesia’s medical sector, Reuters reported.
Both SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and Indonesian Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin attended the launch ceremony in Bali’s Denpasar. Before the launch, Starlink had secured authorization to provide internet services in the country, Communication and Information Minister Budi Arie Setiadi previously confirmed to Reuters.
The service seeks to extend internet accessibility in remote areas of Indonesia. Since better internet access would enable real-time data input, Starlink is expected to support the government’s efforts to alleviate health issues like stunting and malnutrition.
Sadikin said that there are currently 10,000 health clinics scattered around Indonesia, but around 2,700 remain underserved by local internet providers. Starlink has been introduced at two health centers in Bali and one on Aru Island, one of the country’s outermost islands.
At the launch event, Musk said that the service can also potentially be used to enhance the country’s education and business sectors.
Starlink currently controls about 60% of the roughly 7,500 satellites orbiting the Earth. Aside from Indonesia, it operates in two other Southeast Asian countries: Malaysia and the Philippines.
In Ukraine, the military, hospitals, businesses, and aid organizations extensively use the service. Earlier today, Starlink also announced that it’s now available in Fiji, marking its 99th supported country.

Hello reader,
I’m yet to make it onto the property ladder, and as a 30-year-old from the British Isles, that’s a big deal. Owning your own home is seen as incredibly important where I come from, but it’s never something I’ve obsessed over, partly because I don’t want to be tied down but mostly because I lack that kind of wealth.
If I was trying to buy or sell a house though, I feel like it’s a decision I would take a long time over. After all, it’s the biggest purchase many of us are likely to make.
So I don’t feel like being able to list the house I was trying to sell for free would be a huge draw. What good is penny pinching when we’re talking about a transaction worth at least six figures?
Thinking like that is partly why property portals like PropertyGuru (PGRU, NYSE) and 99.co aren’t awfully worried about Singapore’s Housing &amp; Development Board and its plan to shake up the city-state’s real estate market with a new free (for now) listing website.
As today’s Big Story by my colleague Samreen dives into, the complexities of buying a property coupled with the incumbents’ market share and experience mean no one is quaking in their boots just yet.

3 Trends to keep an eye on
Hot stocks, earnings reports, restructuring, pressure from activist investors, and more.

Photo credit: Reuters

1️⃣ Smooth seas for Sea: Sea Group (SE, NYSE) posted its financial results for the first quarter of 2024 last week, and it’s fair to say the company has enjoyed a solid start to the year.
Revenue for the quarter increased to US$3.7 billion, a 23% jump from Q1 2023. However, adjusted EBITDA was down 21% year on year to US$401 million, though that was a 3.2x increase from Q4’s result last year.
Much of the revenue growth was driven by Sea’s ecommerce arm Shopee, which enjoyed jumps in both revenue and gross merchandise value, with logistics playing an important role. On an earnings call, Sea Group CFO Tony Hou noted that more than half of Shopee’s orders in Asia are fulfilled by SPX Express, the ecommerce firm’s in-house logistics unit.
2️⃣ Grabbing profit: Grab (GRAB, NDAQ) also released its earnings for Q1 2024 last week, with the key takeaway being an all-time high adjusted EBITDA figure of US$62 million.
The result represents a US$129 million improvement year on year and led the super app to revise its 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance upward. The new guidance stands at between US$250 million and US$270 million, up from between US$180 million and US$200 million.
Grab’s CEO Anthony Tan laid credit for the result on the firm’s “focus on product-led growth.” He also said that on-demand gross merchandise value had hit new heights and that Grab’s “affordability and reliability” push was encouraging more people to use the platform and increase order frequency.
3️⃣ Views from China: It’s Q1 earnings season in nearby China too, where both Alibaba (BABA, NYSE) and Tencent (700, SEHK) recorded bumps in revenue and operating profit.
Alibaba’s revenue increased by 7% year on year to hit US$30.7 billion, driven by growth across the firm’s product lineup. Operating profit rose 13% year on year to US$15.7 billion for its 2024 financial year.
Meanwhile, Tencent’s total revenue hit US$22.5 billion for Q1 2024, up 6% year on year, led by a 26% revenue growth in its online advertising business. The company’s non-IFRS operating profit jumped 30% year over year to US$8.3 billion.

US$184 billion: The size of SoftBank Group (9984, TYO)’s portfolio with 477 companies. Vision Fund CFO Navneet Govil told Reuters that the size of the portfolio across so many companies gives SoftBank an edge over smaller rivals when it comes to investing in AI.


60%: The year-on-year revenue increase AnyMind Group (5027, TYO) recorded in the first quarter of 2024, hitting US$67 million. The Japan-based ecommerce enabler also generated roughly US$2.3 million in operating profit for the quarter.

Google vs. OpenAI: When the name of a company’s main product becomes a verb, you’d think it means the firm has the market cornered. But that might not be the case much longer for Google.
The Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL, Nasdaq)-owned search engine is firmly locked in a race with ChatGPT maker OpenAI to fundamentally change how we surf the internet. The goal is to build a search engine that functions more like conversational AI. The prize? Billions of dollars.
The retooled Google search engine will reportedly favor responses generated by the company’s own AI tech over the web links we’re used to.
Upstarts like Perplexity AI are trying to do the same thing, but a company with more resources such as OpenAI likely poses a far greater threat to Google.
That’s not all that’s under threat, as news publishers have sounded the alarm that what Google calls its attempt to “take care of the legwork” will further diminish web traffic to their sites. If Google’s AI search can answer users’ questions, why click through to a link?
Regardless of how all this plays out, it does feel like major changes to how we interact with the internet at a fundamental level are coming.

Didi Global’s co-founder Jean Liu has resigned from her roles as president and board director of the Chinese ride-hailing giant, Reuters reported, citing an internal company letter.
Liu is a former Goldman Sachs banker who helped lead Didi for 10 years. She was key to Didi’s merger with Kuaidi and its takeover of Uber China, and she helped bring in investments from firms like Apple.
She will now transition to a new position as “permanent partner,” where she will retain her current responsibilities including her role as chief people officer, as stated in the internal letter by CEO Will Cheng.
“I hope that I can focus more on the company’s long-term development in the future,” Liu said in the letter.
Her resignation comes after a tumultuous period for Didi. Days after its US$4.4 billion US IPO in 2021, the Chinese government banned Didi from local app stores due to data collection violations, which led to a US$1.2 billion fine. The firm also delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in 2022.

Snowflake, a platform for AI and data analytics workloads, is mulling a US$1 billion deal to acquire generative AI developer Reka AI, Bloomberg reported, citing sources briefed on the situation.
Reka AI develops large language models that can be used in areas like online customer support and caption generation.
The company was founded by ex-employees of Google and Meta. Yi Tay, a Singaporean, acts as the company’s chief scientist, while CEO Dani Yogatama grew up in Indonesia.
In June 2023, Reka raised US$58 million in a funding round, which Snowflake participated in. The firm is reportedly valued at US$300 million.
Purchasing Reka AI could boost Snowflake’s current business, allowing customers to use third-party AI models. It can also supplement Snowflake’s previous efforts into the AI space – its own language model, Arctic, launched in April.
Similarly, Reka launched its first multimodal language model called Reka Core in April. The company said it is competitive with the leading models of OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google at the time.
This proposed acquisition coincides with a slump in Snowflake’s revenue growth due to companies cutting down on their software purchases. This year so far, Snowflake’s shares dropped 17%.

The Philippines generates up to 61,000 metric tons of solid waste daily. However, some government initiatives and the growing adoption of a circular economy within the country’s private sector are helping to reduce this number.
One example from the tech sector is Humble Sustainability, a Manila-based cleantech startup that helps B2B clients sell their electronic equipment instead of throwing it away.
The company recently received a capital boost in a round led by Gobi Partners through the Gobi-Core Philippine Fund. The funding amount was undisclosed.
The Philippines’ National Development Company, Double River Impact, Equitrust Holdings, and other investors from the XA Network also joined the round.
“I was born and raised in the Philippines, where my childhood experiences of thrifting filled me with joy and instilled an early awareness of the value of repurposed items,” co-founder and COO Nina Mirabueno Opida said in a statement.
Unlike the usual thrift stores in the country, which mostly sell secondhand clothes and shoes, Humble Sustainability mainly offers smartphones, laptops, and appliances. The conditions of these products range from like-new items to units that are still in good condition but have no box.
The startup’s activities with several corporations have shifted over 250,000 kilograms of electronic waste away from landfills. Currently, it serves more than 75 clients, including Canva, Manulife, and Sunlife.
Humble Sustainability, which also offers reports and analysis to support customers in reaching their ESG goals, plans to explore regional expansion.
In the long term, the company, which last secured a seed round led by Seedstars International Ventures in 2022, aims to recirculate 1 billion items.

The liquidators were also present during the meeting.

The announcement shocked Hearti Lab’s creditors, a group consisting of vendors and investors, including seasoned entrepreneurs and the CEOs of publicly listed companies.
Hearti Lab owed debts amounting to more than S$2.5 million in total, and most of them would be annulled by the liquidation.
Keith, whose registered name is Lim Chee Seng, was personally on the hook for S$325,000 of the debt after the liquidation, which was completed on July 19, 2023, according to Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) documents. A bankruptcy order of above S$500,000 was also filed against him.
Described by investors as an intelligent and eloquent salesman, Keith founded Hearti Lab in 2014 to bring insurance services to the uninsured.
The goal was to use blockchain to decentralize insurance, enabling the firm to offer flexible, affordable, and personalized products covering single flights, gadgets, and even farm animals.
In 2022, the company raised a series A round with a valuation of above S$15 million. 
It touted big insurance and banking customers like United Overseas Insurance Limited (UOI), a member of the UOB Group; SOMPO Insurance, an insurance provider under Nikkei 225-listed SOMPO Holdings; and Malaysia-based Maybank. 
And yet, Hearti Lab struggled to meet its financial projections or turn profitable, according to documents seen by Tech in Asia. 
By 2022, the company and Keith had accumulated 12 court cases in total, including a criminal charge by Singapore’s Central Provident Fund Board for missing mandatory CPF payments to its employees.


An email from liquidators said that while Hearti Lab “is not denying liabilities,” it “has minimal assets” and is unlikely to “pay any of the creditors.” 
What made creditors angry, however, was not Hearti Labs’ failure or debts. Instead, they were mad at how Keith persuaded them to invest and at how he communicated the company’s financial status and liquidation.
Speaking to Tech in Asia, Keith contends that “it is common for businesses to have creditors,” adding that he is “also a creditor to other businesses and persons.”
“If anyone has evidence of fraud, they should contact the relevant authorities with the evidence,” he says. 
Dispute over shares
In 2018, the company launched its first artificial intelligence product Surety.AI, an insurance platform that was envisioned to disrupt the industry.  
Hearti Lab was also looking to expand beyond Singapore. To secure funding, Keith assured investors that they could “get their money back” by selling their shares to the company should it fail to achieve targets.

However, investors that Tech in Asia spoke to had difficulties availing of this buyback offer despite attempts to do so. 
One of the investors, Peter (name changed), had missed the deadline as he was under the impression that he had issued a loan to Keith instead.
Keith approached Peter, a notable figure in the fintech industry, in 2018 and asked him to invest in Hearti Lab. 
However, Peter never received any shares despite transferring the funds and signing a share agreement. He only found out about this when he reached out to Keith in 2020. After discovering the discrepancy, Peter pressed for the return of his money.
Keith claimed in court that there was an oral agreement involving the shares and cited concerns about Peter’s company. Since Peter was the CEO of a firm beset by rumors of fraud, his Hearti Lab shares were held in trust by Keith.
I reiterate that [Karen and Kian Huat] contributed to the failure of Hearti. 
The judge dismissed Keith’s claim on the grounds that there was no documentary evidence of an oral trust, nor were there any phone records showing that the call where the oral agreement was made took place. Keith was unable to explain why he could not produce such a record. 
Keith’s conduct was also inconsistent with someone holding shares in trust, the judge added. For instance, Keith never provided Peter with Hearti Lab’s audited financial statements. 
The judge also noted contradictions in Keith’s concerns around Peter’s company.  For instance, Keith still asked Peter to be involved with Surety.AI even after hearing the rumors about Peter’s company. 
Peter’s name and picture were also used on the marketing materials for Surety.AI.
In April 2024, the court ordered Keith to repay Peter in full.
Things did not pan out as well for angel investor Lim Kian Huat and his daughter Joyce Lim, who sued Keith over share disputes. (Tech in Asia could not ascertain whether the three are related.)  
Kian Huat lent Hearti Lab over S$1 million in a convertible loan note. But when his own business got into trouble, he talked to Keith in April 2020 about an early repayment.
Keith said he would get back to Kian Huat about his request. But three days later, Keith instead informed Kian Huat that his loans had been automatically converted into shares, triggered by the supposed capital raise with venture funds Cornerstone Venture Partners and Sony Investment Funds.

This meant that the loan would no longer be repayable. Kian Huat protested, explaining that no capital raise had occurred and he had not agreed to convert the loans into shares in the absence of such an event. 
To justify a capital raise, Hearti Lab was required to amass a total of S$4 million in funds as stated in its Convertible Loan Agreement clause. But by June 2020, it had secured only half the sum and was reliant upon the new raise from both venture funds to qualify.  
Hearti Lab had only received an email of consideration from Sony and a term sheet from Cornerstone, which do not guarantee an investment. Term sheets are commonly understood to be non-binding agreements. In the end, both funds pulled out after doing due diligence.
When asked why Kian Huat’s loan conversion was triggered even though the fundraising didn’t happen, Keith told Tech in Asia that Hearti Lab’s lawyer had advised them that the term sheet constituted a capital raise. 
This conversion notice came in 2020, at a time when Hearti Lab was slashing and freezing salaries as well as facing payment delays from its customers. Its revenue that year of S$842,000 was a far cry from its projection of over S$3 million. 
In the end, Kian Huat’s loan wasn’t converted, and his court case to get repaid was withdrawn due to Hearti Lab’s liquidation.
Did the investors ask for the liabilities? If not, why not ask for the information before investing?
During Hearti Lab’s April 2021 annual general meeting (AGM), Keith told shareholders that the refusal of Kian Huat and another angel investor called Karen Lim to convert their convertible loans into shares contributed to the company’s collapse. (Tech in Asia could not ascertain whether the investors are related to each other and/or to Keith.)
Hearti Lab also had to give up on expanding into India since the new funding from Cornerstone and Sony would have been used to pay off Kian Huat and Karen first, leaving the startup with little or nothing for the expansion, Keith told Tech in Asia.
“I reiterate that [Karen and Kian Huat] contributed to the failure of Hearti,” he said, adding that he walked away from new funds for this reason. 
Cornerstone and Sony, however, said they pulled out of the deal after conducting due diligence on Hearti Lab.
On further reflection, Keith told Tech in Asia that he had failed to align the interests of Hearti Lab and its investors.
“In our case, we have convertible loan holders whose interests were to receive regular interest rate returns and they were not looking to hold shares in Hearti,” he says.
He also conceded that he could have acted more “decisively to cut jobs and costs,” given the uncertainties brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic and how the company eventually ran out of cash. 
Alleged lack of information
As Keith grappled with unhappy shareholders, he was fighting a war on another front: creditors alleging that he had withheld information in a bid to raise funds or delay repayments. 

“If anyone has evidence of fraud, they should contact the relevant authorities with the evidence,” says Keith Lim. / Photo credit: Keith Lim

Karen Lim and another investor said that when they were considering funding Hearti Lab between 2019 to 2020, Keith did not disclose the actual financial statements of the company, which had been recording losses since at least 2018 and failed to meet projections.
The two investors and another notable venture fund also didn’t know that Hearti Lab was already involved in court cases with other creditors nor that it was being charged by Singapore’s CPF for missing staff payments.
The company’s employees received their salaries and CPFs late on multiple occasions throughout 2019, according to a former employee who spoke to Tech in Asia. Jinson Xu, Hearti Lab’s ex-CTO, left in December 2019, according to his LinkedIn page. 
Karen had issued a S$500,000 convertible loan to Hearti Lab in 2019. But when she asked for the money to be returned a year later, Keith said he could not do so, citing “insufficient funds.” 
She claimed to be “induced” by Keith “to believe that [Hearti] was operating profitably and had the ability and the capacity to repay the loans that were extended,” she said in her court affidavit against the company.



 
In response, Keith stated in his affidavit that he did not give Karen the impression that the convertible loan was a prudent investment, nor did he make representations to her about the company’s ability to repay its loans. His reasoning is that Karen had “business knowledge and a sound mind to make her own decisions.”
Keith further asked Tech in Asia: “Did the investors ask for the liabilities? If not, why not ask for the information before investing? Please note that [they] are experienced investors.”
When Tech in Asia pressed Keith for proof that he gave potential investors a fair picture of Hearti Lab’s financials, he said it was all lost after the liquidation.
Hearti Lab also got into a legal tussle with two service providers it had engaged.
Kieran (name changed), whose company provided tech talent services to Hearti Lab including managing the staff’s salaries, was owed payment amounting to over S$124,000 between January 2020 to November 2020. The debt comprised Hearti’s employee salaries that Kieran’s company handled.
Keith had told Kieran that Hearti was facing a “cash flow issue,” but the money and repayment would come in soon through investor funds and an Enterprise Singapore (ESG) development grant.
Maybe I should not have lowered my guard.
To reassure Kieran, Keith would show him investors’ interest in the form of WhatsApp texts and emails. However, Keith did not relay that he was being sued by creditors. 
“I thought that the company was OK; it had investors behind it, which is why I was OK to continue [our services to Hearti]. I didn’t want to sue him as I thought the grant money was coming in,” says Kieran.
But when the money did come in, it was frozen by the bank due to a garnishee order, which happens when the court directs a third party – such as a debtor’s bank – to repay a creditor the money that the debtor owes.
Kieran panicked when he heard about the garnishee order, because it meant the money meant for him was stuck. He then started legal proceedings against Hearti Lab and Keith, and the court gave an order in Kieran’s favor. 
Till date, however, only one third of the S$125,000 debt has been repaid.
Creditors also discovered later that Keith and Hearti Lab had shared some information that was inconsistent.
For instance, the company’s actual 2019 total liabilities amounted to S$2,465,885 on the financial statement that was disclosed to creditors during the liquidation. 
However, it was registered with ACRA as S$721,768 and S$1,599,660 on its April 2021 AGM deck that was shared with shareholders. 
An investor who spoke to Tech in Asia claimed that Keith had informed him that liabilities added up to a much smaller sum than the amounts mentioned above. 
Keith denies saying this to the investor and stressed that the company’s financial statements were reported by its CFO, and he trusts her professionalism and integrity. 
Creditors told Tech in Asia that when they reached out to ask for their money back,  Keith would give a myriad of reasons why it was not possible. This pattern would last for well over a year, punctuated with periods of silence when Lim would be unreachable.

Keith would also commit to responding by a specific date but then fail to do so. In the end, most of Hearti Lab’s creditors never saw the money materialize. 
When Tech in Asia asked investors why they did not do more due diligence before investing, they said they had trusted Keith. Most of them knew him from before or were introduced to him by mutual connections.
The investors also claimed they were not given enough time to verify information about Hearti lab.
That said, Keith did give them between one to three months to look into the company, which is not uncommon.“Maybe I should not have lowered my guard,” laments an angel investor. 
The aftermath
OneConnect Financial Technology bought Surety.AI in 2021, taking over its intellectual property license and workforce.
While the liquidation of Hearti Lab was still underway in 2022, Keith had started his new role as regional enterprise business director at insurance consultancy ReMark, a unit of France-based SCOR Group, and as an advisor at On-us, a Hong Kong-based fintech company.

Keith had listed these roles on his LinkedIn profile, which was unavailable when Tech in Asia checked on May 17. Also, his title on the On-Us website is general manager of Southeast Asia, not advisor. 
These two roles gave him an income of S$28,000 a month, according to his affidavit.
Before his LinkedIn page became inaccessible, he also listed himself as the founder of Benefit.X, a product developed at Hearti Lab but is now being used to create a patent.
He has tried to avoid bankruptcy by appealing to two creditors and sought approval from the Singapore high court to repay Peter outside of legal orders, saying that going bankrupt would affect his employment and income. 
His request for a voluntary arrangement with Peter was dismissed by the court and the bankruptcy actions are ongoing.
I had to make the decision to use the remaining cash to pay creditors or employee salaries. I chose the latter.
Contrary to what Keith had proposed to shareholders during the company’s April 2021 AGM, none of the sale proceeds were used to pay shareholder dividends or to pay creditors that Tech in Asia spoke with.
Hearti Lab had run out of funds before any repayment plans could be made, Keith explained to Tech in in Asia. “The whole liquidation process, including the sale of assets, was handled by the liquidator. I am not responsible for the distribution of payment or dividends,” he says.
Keith declined to reveal the sale value of Surety.AI. But Hearti Lab’s liquidators told creditors that the estimated realizable value of the company’s assets was only S$100 at the time of the liquidation, after Surety.AI had been sold.
Remaining creditors are not optimistic that they will get their money back, attributing their lack of faith to Keith’s unfulfilled commitments and repeated delays on repayment.
When asked about the debts that Hearti Lab failed to repay, Lim said that he considered S$2.5 million – the amount owed to investors – to be low compared to how much money other startups at Hearti Lab’s stage of development usually owe. 
When Tech in Asia asked the company’s creditors – many of whom invest in other startups and have witnessed their fair share of business closures – if their experience with Hearti Lab is typically how investing in tech startups goes, their reply was “no.” 
In response, Lim told Tech in Asia that the liquidation matter is closed, and the claims and complaints from “disgruntled” creditors are now a distraction for him. 
“I had to make the decision to use the remaining cash to pay creditors or employee salaries. I chose the latter,” he says. ","Founder Keith Lim has denied creditors’ allegations, saying, “If anyone has evidence of fraud, they should contact the relevant authorities.”",Candice Lee,Edited by Terence Lee and Eileen C.

Traditional extraction methods are notorious for their environmental damage. For instance, nickel mining operations in Sulawesi, Indonesia have led to severe deforestation and contamination of water sources with heavy metals.
However, nickel and cobalt mining is crucial for manufacturing electric vehicle batteries. And since Indonesia harbors around 22% of the world’s nickel reserves, it’s becoming a major target for EV companies.
Climate tech companies like BaniQL are trying new methods to reduce water, energy, and chemical use, thereby minimizing ecological impact. The San Fransisco-based firm has recently raised a US$1.6 million seed round led by Beenext, with participation from Seedstars International Ventures and A2D Ventures, among others.
BaniQL works to lessen the environmental impact of mining by producing nickel products from metal waste and lower-grade nickel ores through a proprietary extraction method that uses less heat and pressure.
The company is poised to capitalize on the growing market for battery materials as well, which is projected to reach US$82 billion by 2030.
BaniQL said it will use the seed funding to develop a prototype facility, expand its R&amp;D and engineering teams, and support general operations.
The company also operates in Indonesia, South Korea, Australia, and the Philippines. Its operations encompass patent development, industry collaboration, and continuous product improvement.

Hi readers,
I’ve never been a competitive person my entire life, which is why I can’t see myself as an athlete. A 100-meter dash? You mean a 100-meter walk, right? I kid, of course.
I had the opportunity to interview former Japanese footballer Keisuke Honda during the recent KL20 Summit as part of a feature story on athletes wading into the VC world.
I asked him why he stepped into a risky investment class. Usually people of his stature would put their money into real estate or some sports-related stuff, or maybe set up an academy and do private coaching.
He told me that he was always exposed to risk as a sportsman, so wearing the VC hat isn’t any different.
Playing sports and betting on an investment are two different things. But he is right to point out that his life as a sportsperson made him used to taking risks.
The life of a sportsperson is about highs and lows – there’s no middle. You are either at the top of your game or you crash and burn. You spend money, time, and effort for just a single goal.
Any financial adviser will tell you that’s a bad investment and you should diversify instead.
But there are merits, on certain occasions, where going all-in may be worth it.
To be sure, none of these athletes are going all-in as VCs. It’s just one part of their large portfolio.
A question posed to me while writing this article was whether founders would purposely undervalue their startups for some of these athletes to show up on companies’ cap tables.
It’s a good question to which I have no answers.
But what these celebrities bring to the table is a different dynamic to the VC space, especially on this side of the globe. And more are expected to throw their hats in the ring in the chase of landing the next “decacorn.”
Perhaps being risk-on in investing is one of many ways for them to continually feel like being in the ring.

Hello reader,
This week’s deals cumulatively top the US$1 billion-dollar mark.
I remember watching Who Wants to be a Millionaire as a kid and how life-changing it made a million dollars sound. Plus, it was far from easy to even get to the quarter-million mark in the game, which made it seem all the more impressive.
Then I start working in tech and – even in a tech winter – we’re seeing funding rounds worth tens and hundreds of millions get closed every week. Of course, we’re comparing money for individuals with money for large corporations, but there’s still a slight dissonance.
I guess we, as a tech ecosystem, can take some comfort in knowing that the money is out there – it just might be a little harder to convince investors to pony up for now.

Thoughtful reads
1️⃣ Product-market fit is hard to achieve…
… and there’s at least 20 ways to do it, if this article from First Round Review is any indication.
Hopefully the lessons can at least point you in the right direction.
2️⃣ Wahey, here’s another article on AI
AI is everywhere, but how much of it is real application and how much is just what’s been done before but not dubbed “AI”?
That’s a question that needs more digging into, but for now we can at least remind ourselves how to implement AI in a responsible manner.
3️⃣ How to grow a company (this subheader is a failed vegetables pun)
It’s time for another Masters of Scale episode, and this one is about a US-based fast-growing restaurant business focused on salads and grain bowls.
(I am once again reminded of the miniscule size of the Singapore market.)
4️⃣ User retention at AI companies
It’s a new frontier but an age-old challenge. This article from the Andreessen Horowitz website provides some tips for AI-native firms to encourage users to keep coming back.
5️⃣ Do androids dream of electric sheep?
I read the title of this Harvard Business Review article and immediately thought of this subheader.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk / Photo credit: Shutterstock

Electric-vehicle maker Tesla is building a data center in China to develop algorithms that could power its self-driving technology globally, sources told Reuters.
The US-based company plans to send its Chinese EV data abroad for its full self-driving system, but it has yet to get regulatory approval. Currently, Tesla also can’t offer its full US$9,000 full self-driving system in China.
Through a year-long pilot program, businesses in Shanghai’s Lingang area, where Tesla’s factory is located, might permit some data transfer without extra security checks. If successful, this could expedite autonomous driving deployment, potentially positioning China as a key adopter. This can mirror Tesla’s 2019 launch of its Shanghai Gigafactory, which steered it towards mass-market EV production.
However, experts believe that achieving full vehicle autonomy is still years away with Tesla’s current driver-assistance features in China, which require a driver’s readiness to take over.
With dwindling EV demand, Tesla has also been turning to AI-powered products like self-driving to stay ahead. It could supercharge Tesla’s numbers, given that after recent mass layoffs, the company is expected to post the lowest profit margins in six years.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has reportedly reached out to Nvidia to source graphics processing units for its China-based data center. US sanctions, however, prohibit the sale of Nvidia’s top chips in China.
Musk has also reportedly spoken with Chinese Premier Li Qiang about Tesla’s investment in a local data center and licensing its full self-driving tech to Chinese EV makers.

Singapore-based Mito Health will join Y Combinator’s Summer 2024 batch, coinciding with the healthtech firm’s US launch in Q3, according to CEO and co-founder Kenneth Lou.
Lou launched the company last year along with Tee-Ming Chew after they started and eventually exited finance firm Seedly.
“It’s been a journey of 10 years and multiple times of trying over three startups in the past to be part of the best accelerator in the world,” Lou said in a LinkedIn post.
Now with Mito Health, the pair crafts individualized healthcare plans using customer diagnostic results and wearable data, with support from AI.
The company previously told Tech in Asia that the preventive healthcare market in developed Southeast Asian and Australian cities could exceed US$4.5 billion annually.
Mito Health will participate in the Y Combinator program in San Francisco from July to September 2024, eyeing a larger healthtech presence.
“We really can’t wait to be part of the best builders in the world, creating the future together – particularly with the influx of new AI models and building on the next revolution in the industry of healthcare and medical [with] longevity,” Lou added.
The healthtech company raised US$1.3 million in April 2023, with Forge Ventures leading the round.
Besides the summer program, Y Combinator also holds a winter program from January to March. This year, 260 out of over 27,000 applicants were selected to be part of the Winter 2024 cohort, bringing the Y Combinator community to 4,500 startups and 11,000 founders in total.

Photo credit: Good Meat

Singapore-based Huber’s Butchery has become the first retailer globally to sell lab-grown meat, or meat derived from cultivating animal cells, Wired reported. The new product was made through an exclusive partnership with Good Meat, which operates under the US-based foodtech firm Eat Just.
However, the product is mostly made of plant protein, which makes it similar to other plant-based meats already being sold globally. The chicken – called Good Meat 3 – consists of only 3% animal cells.
Despite the low animal cell count, Good Meat says it has received positive consumer feedback on the product’s taste, texture, and look during testing.
The lab-made meat is priced at S$7.20 (US$5.34) for a 120-gram portion of frozen chicken, which is notably higher than traditional meat products in Singaporean markets. Elevated prices have historically deterred customers from purchasing plant-based meat.
That said, this launch is crucial for the cultured meat sector, which has been struggling to secure more capital. According to the Wired report, the global industry raised US$226 million in 2023, a significant decline from US$922 million the previous year.
Companies like Eat Just are pressured to enhance cost efficiency and profitability. For Eat Just specifically, this pressure comes on top of legal and financial hurdles.
The company also reportedly suspended operations in Singapore in March, but it said shortly after that it would resume production in the country in partnership with Huber’s Butchery. Eat Just added that it aims to produce the most chicken-alternative products this year compared to its previous years combined.

Hello reader,
There’s just something about spending time by the sea that brings me peace.
Whether the water is warm or cold, calm or squally, looking out across vast oceans is a soothing experience. Gazing out at something so much bigger than I can fathom certainly helps make whatever’s troubling me seem pretty trivial.
Swimming in those same waters only heightens the experience. There’s something freeing about letting the waves crash around you and letting go of control.
In Southeast Asia’s tech world, Sea Group isn’t controlled by the waves – it makes them. The firm’s first quarter of the year was a lot smoother than that segue, as our featured story on its financial health shows.
Today we look at:


Sea Group buoyed by solid Q1 results 
Grab records an all-time high in adjusted EBITDA
Other newsy highlights such as TikTok creators filing suit to stop the app from being banned in the US and Indian insurtech firm Go Digit raising US$141 million ahead of its IPO.

Come see Sea’s financials

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Sea Group’s first-quarter financial results are out, and it’s safe to say that Southeast Asia’s biggest internet firm is off to a strong start for 2024.
The company recorded improvements to both its top line and bottom line amid solid revenue growth from ecommerce arm Shopee.


Where Shopee goes, Sea follows: Total revenue for Q1 hit US$3.7 billion, an increase of 23% from the same period in 2023. Much of the revenue growth was driven by Shopee, which saw its GAAP revenue hit US$2.7 billion, up 33% year on year.

: While revenue was up on a year-on-year basis, Sea’s adjusted EBITDA for the opening quarter of 2024 did fall by 21% to US$401 million compared to Q1 2023. However, this was a marked improvement from the fourth quarter of 2023, when the figure stood at US$126.7 million.

Show me the money: SeaMoney, the company’s digital financial services unit, also recorded revenue growth, up 21% year on year to US$499 million. The division’s adjusted EBITDA increased by 50% from Q1 2023 to US$149 million.

Grab in the black

The first quarter of the year was a milestone for Southeast Asian super app Grab, as the firm recorded an all-time high adjusted EBITDA of US$62 million.
The figure represents an increase of US$129 million against Q1 2023.


Goal reset: The solid result has led Grab to revise its adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2024 upward. It’s now set at between US$250 million and US$270 million after previously being between US$180 million and US$200 million.

Not-so-secret recipe: In a statement, Grab group CEO Anthony Tan said the firm’s focus on product-led growth was paying off, with on-demand gross merchandise value hitting new highs. “Our push on affordability and reliability is pulling more people onto our platform and driving up order frequency,” he added.

Delivering revenue: The company’s revenue for the quarter rose by 24% year on year to US$653 million, while its loss stood at US$115 million. Deliveries made up the lion’s share of Q1’s revenue at US$350 million.

According to a survey by payments major Wise, roughly 73% of Filipinos still use traditional platforms for transferring money internationally. Additionally, only 21% of respondents said they understand hidden fees like inflated exchange rates.
With this, the company has decided to launch its Wise Account and prepaid card in the Philippines. With these services, users can receive foreign payments for free, hold money in over 40 currencies, move money to a local bank account or supported digital wallets, and spend overseas in more than 160 countries. Users can manage transactions via Wise’s website or mobile app.
Through these products, Wise aims to cater to different user groups such as freelancers, international students, travelers, and relatives of overseas workers.
The company is entering a potentially large market, considering the amount of personal remittances being sent to the Philippines – it hit a record high of US$37.2 billion in 2023.
Wise Philippines is led by country manager Areson Cuevas. Prior to joining the payments firm, Cuevas was COO at MarCoPay, a fintech service catered to Filipino seafarers.
“Wise is on a mission to expand globally and help even more customers avoid unfair exchange rates and hidden fees,” he said in a statement.
The company plans to introduce more funding options to Filipino users via bank transfers and e-wallets. Currently, customers can only top up their accounts using a bank card.
Founded in 2011, Wise has over 10 million customers across the globe, operating in more than 50 countries. In Southeast Asia, the company also has operations in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand.

Vertex Ventures Japan (VVJ) has launched its inaugural fund, the Vertex Ventures Japan Fund I. Anchored by Singapore-based Vertex Holdings and worth 10 billion yen (US$64.2 million), the fund plans to invest in Japanese startups.
VVJ aims to leverage Vertex’s global VC presence in identifying early-stage investment opportunities, inspired by Vertex’s ventures in China, Israel, Southeast Asia, India, and the US. The new fund’s launch follows Vertex Ventures Southeast Asia and India raising US$541 million for its fifth fund in September 2023.
These funds are separately and independently managed by their respective general partners, and focus on different industries.
VVJ itself focuses on deeptech, digital transformation, AI, and the creator economy. Its management team includes managing partner Takashi Tomita and general partner Tomohiro Miyasaka, who will both lead the company’s efforts to scout for investments and develop VVJ’s relationships with new and existing sources of capital.
“The innovation platform aims to facilitate collaborations between companies, universities, the central government of Japan, and local governments in Japan to accelerate the growth of startups and create the next generation of industry champions,” said Tomita.
In an interview with Nikkei Asia, Vertex Holdings CEO Chua Kee Lock said that timing of VVJ’s new fund coincides with the Japanese government’s increasing support for startups. In December 2022, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida pledged “bold investments” into areas like “startups, innovation, and decarbonization.”
Additionally, Vertex Holdings has partnered with the University of Tokyo (UTokyo) and UTokyo IPC – the university’s investment platform – to bolster startup investment as well as promote human resource and R&amp;D developments in the startup ecosystems of Japan and Singapore.

The global anime market is predicted to grow from US$25.8 billion in 2022 to US$62.7 billion a decade later.
Anime is big in Singapore too. A 2022 YouGov survey found that 52% of its over 1,000 participants have watched anime at least once. Of the 48% that haven’t done so, 21% can see themselves watching anime in the future.
To capture a piece of this market, Kendrick Wong – a serial entrepreneur who founded retail analytics platform Omnilytics and fashion app Shoppr – launched Kasagi Labo, a Singapore-based anime venture studio, in 2023.
Kasagi Labo mainly provides Japanese anime content through intellectual property licensing, distribution, and merchandising. These include original animations, limited edition merchandise, and virtual anime experiences.
In October last year, the company collaborated with Netflix and anime studio Genco to release mobile accessories based on the Pluto anime series.
Kasagi Labo recently raised US$12 million in a pre-series A round, boosting its total funding to US$20 million so far.
The round’s lead investor was Burda Principal Investments, a unit of the European media and tech giant Hubert Burda Media. CMT Digital, Superscrypt, Hashed, Sfermion, and Gold House Foundation also joined the fundraise.
Kasagi Labo will use the new funds to form partnerships and acquire existing anime IPs, it said in a statement. Wong also said that the partnership with Burda Principal Investments may help the venture studio enter new markets.
The company added that its plans align with trends stimulated by the rise of video-on-demand services. In 2020, global anime sales surpassed Japanese sales for the first time, which was attributed to an increase in anime distribution due to streaming, among other factors.

848742,2024-05-17T01:00:13,2024-05-17T03:29:04,"PropertyGuru, 99.co unfazed by new HDB home listings portal",sg-home-listings-portal-poses-threat-propertyguru-99co,publish,post,https://www.techinasia.com/sg-home-listings-portal-poses-threat-propertyguru-99co,"Singapore’s Housing &amp; Development Board (HDB) unveiled a new home listing service this week, shaking up a property listings market that has, for years, been dominated by platforms like PropertyGuru and 99.co.
Called Resale Flat Listing (RFL) and expected to officially launch sometime later this month, this service lets homeowners list their homes for sale “free of charge for the time being.” To compare, homeowners have to go through a property agent, who pays a fee to put up a listing on PropertyGuru and 99.co.

Photo credit: Housing &amp; Development Board’s website

With nearly 77% of the Singapore population living in the public housing built by the HDB, the new portal could change the way millions of Singaporeans buy and sell homes.
Darius Cheung – CEO of 99 Group, which operates 99.co – tells Tech in Asia he welcomes the move, which creates more “transparency and trust in the market.”
The exec doesn’t expect the new listings portal to impact his business. Finding a property, after all, is a “long journey” in which users spend lots of time online and visit multiple sites to make the best decision.
He adds that 99 Group’s core user group of millennials are savvy property buyers who “need a lot of additional information” – from location, travel time, nearby amenities, to transaction data – as well as price estimation tools, which the company’s platform provides.

The 99.co team / Photo credit: 99.co

“We don’t think about competition much and focus on the customer, so we see more opportunity to work with the government, who shares our same goals,” he says.
Similarly, PropertyGuru said it “welcomed the initiative” by HDB and that it looks forward to “partnering with HDB,” though it didn’t share details of what such a partnership might entail.
Game changer?
Why might HDB’s RFL service be a game changer? For starters, a portal operated by the public housing authority itself inspires trust, particularly in a space where scams and fake listings on third-party platforms remain rampant.
Listings on RFL will be “verified and non-duplicative,” according to HDB.
That’s because both flat buyers will need to produce a valid letter demonstrating their eligibility to purchase a flat before they can obtain a seller’s contact details and schedule viewing appointments through the portal. Sellers, meanwhile, will need to register their intent to sell with HDB in order to list on the platform.
This would alleviate the problem of fake and duplicate listings that afflict property listing portals. Proposals like issuing a unique serial number to each home haven’t managed to solve the problem.
HDB flats also account for a majority of residential real estate transactions in Singapore. In 2023, there were 26,735 HDB transactions, 1.6x the number of non-landed private property transactions.
The RFL service is also free of charge – at least for the time being – making it a compelling alternative to listing on PropertyGuru and 99.co, which entails fees.

A portal with only genuine listings will “definitely a benefit” for buyers, sellers, and property agents, according to a real estate broker Tech in Asia spoke to, who did not wish to be identified.
Building up such a reputation will enable the platform to attract more serious buyers, the person adds.
Asked if 99.co will consider a listings option for homeowners, CEO Cheung says the firm had done that in the past but faced a problem of fraudulent listings. In its current setup of accepting only listings from licensed and authenticated agents, the platform has “not had a case of fraud,” Cheung adds.
Too big to ignore
So, how concerned should existing players be?
In actuality – possibly not that much.
99 Group’s Cheung claims that globally, the for-sale-by-owner market is “less than 10%” of gross transaction value and is “generally very small” relative to the overall market.
Meanwhile, PropertyGuru’s market-leading position in Singapore could mean that it’s too big of a listing platform for buyers, sellers, and agents to ignore. The firm claims to have 82% of market share by engagement in the city-state, calculated by the number of visits to a website multiplied by the total amount of time spent on that website.

In 2023, PropertyGuru’s Singapore marketplace accounted for 57% of its group revenue of S$150 million (US$111.6 million), and 78% of its adjusted earnings from its marketplace, according to the company’s most recent financials. The firm also has a presence in Malaysia, Vietnam, and Thailand.
99 Group, which operates in Singapore and Indonesia, posted US$17 million in revenue for 2023, although it did not provide a breakdown by market.
PropertyGuru’s dominant position in Singapore could well insulate it from any impact of HDB’s new portal.
“I don’t think I will reduce my spend on PropertyGuru ads,” the real estate broker says, adding that while they would probably also list properties on the free RFL service, they will “definitely not disregard PropertyGuru” due to the sheer number of eyeballs it gets.
However, the source notes that as a less dominant player in Singapore, 99.co “may be overlooked” by property brokers with a newer and free alternative on the market.

Ohymyhome team / Photo credit: Ohymyhome

Cheung refutes this. The CEO notes that portals offering free listing services have been around “for a long time,” and that the firm’s revenue continues to grow every year despite that because of the value it delivers to its customers.
Nasdaq-listed Ohmyhome, for instance, allows homeowners to list properties at no cost in Singapore, and has been available since 2016.
In any case, 99 Group can also draw support from its business in Indonesia, where it claims to have a 70% market share. According to 99 Group’s website, the firm has been growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 47% since 2019.
The power of profit
While the RFL service may have a chance to shake things up in Singapore’s property market, it’s unlikely to displace the incumbent players, which also have the benefit of offering private property listings that aren’t available on the former.
Being “profit-driven,” portals like PropertyGuru and 99.co are also incentivized to provide the most “user-friendly, stable, and seamless” experience to property buyers and sellers, as well as agents, the real estate broker notes.
99 Group “invests [a] significant amount of resources in R&amp;D every year that focus on its customers’ needs,” Cheung notes.

He adds that in contrast, HDB’s initiative could tackle issues of property speculation and control market prices due to, as the board pointed out, a built-in feature that prompts sellers “if their listing price exceeds the highest transacted price of nearby units of the same flat type in the past six months by 10% or more.”
It’s too soon to determine the impact of the RFL service on the top lines of these businesses, but buyers, sellers, and agents should nevertheless welcome another player in the market – and the competitive pressure it injects into the sector.

Osome, a Singapore-based an AI-powered startup that aims to digitalize corporate management, has booked US$17 million in a new series B funding round. The fundraise is a mix of equity and debt from new and old investors, which the company did not identify.
The round is an extension of a US$25 million series B funding first raised in December 2022, bringing the total to US$42 million.
The announcement comes months after multiple customer complaints rattled the firm amid mass layoffs. By the end of 2023, the company had let go of 70 employees in an attempt to break even.
Osome co-founder and COO Konstantin Lange admitted the past year was “challenging” but sees the new funding as key to meet the firm’s goal to turn profitable. Without sharing specifics, the company said it grew revenues in 2023 while decreasing burn rate.
“All things considered, we’re pleased to have emerged from the year bigger, stronger, and better, with a renewed push towards profitability and sustainability,” Lange said.
The company said the new funding will help it develop its automation capabilities, as well as invest in customer service and marketing needs. Osome also announced that change and growth expert Joerg Ruetschi has joined the company as president and chief transformation officer “to lead the company to profitability.”
Founded in 2017, Osome employs over 400 people in Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, the UK, the Netherlands, and the Philippines.

About 90% of startups worldwide fail, and over two-thirds never even give investors a positive return.
Yet in Southeast Asia, the numbers behind startup failure remain a mystery.  Isolated figures and the occasional startup post-mortem provide an incomplete picture, and Tech in Asia has also found no comprehensive regional summary to date.
As Southeast Asia’s startup ecosystem continues to evolve, we’ve put together this piece to help you keep track of macro-level startup failure trends in the region.

Before we get started, here are a couple of caveats about the data:

Startups are deemed to be inactive if their web domain returns an error message, a for-sale advertisement, or redirects to an inactive social media page.
All charts and visuals in this piece refer only to startups that have either publicly disclosed or have verifiable operating status.

Our analysis kicks off with a look at how failure rates vary over a startup’s last year of funding.

The key causes of startup failure have been documented in a variety of studies.
A 2021 CB Insights analysis listed the inability to raise new capital, lack of market need, and competition as the top three startup killers. A separate commentary in the Harvard Business Review cited pursuing “wrong opportunities” and having too many hands on the steering wheel as reasons why startups fold.
While less significant, ecosystem maturity may have a more influential role to play in Southeast Asia, given the varying levels of development across countries in the region.

Does a startup’s funding stage also tell us anything about its odds of failure? Early-stage companies are naturally more unstable, but does their relatively smaller size contribute to this fragility? Here’s how startup failure rates compare across company sizes.

As industries boom and go bust, here’s how startup failure rates compare across verticals.

Photo credit: Shutterstock

Here are three key takeaways from JD.com’s results for the first quarter of 2024:
1. Steady revenue growth
Revenue of US$36 billion for Q1 was up by 7% from the first quarter of 2023.
JD.com CEO Sandy Xu attributed this to a “focus on user experience,” which helped to drive “strong growth in the number of active users as well as user engagement.”
2. Higher income from operations
Income from operations of US$1.1 billion was 20% higher than in the year-ago period.
CFO Ian Su Shan noted that the company’s “focus on execution” led to “improved operational efficiencies.”
3. Volatile free cash flow
However, JD.com saw significant volatility in free cash flow, swinging from a high of US$6.1 billion in Q2 2023 to a negative US$2.1 billion in the current quarter. This might raise concerns regarding the predictability of its liquidity and operational efficiency.

Here are three key takeaways from Baidu’s results for the first quarter of 2024:
1. Revenue from AI outpacing overall growth
Baidu’s total revenue for the quarter grew by just 1% year on year to US$4.4 billion. However, its AI Cloud business outpaced overall growth, contributing to a 6% year-on-year increase in non-online market revenue to US$935 million.
2. Enhanced operating efficiency and margin expansion
There was a noteworthy improvement in Baidu Core’s non-GAAP operating margin, which expanded both year on year and quarter over quarter to 23.5%. This reflects the company’s focus on enhancing operational efficiency and cost control measures.
3. Robust AI ecosystem and strategic investments
Baidu made significant strides in its AI and intelligent driving businesses. The growth of the PaddlePaddle developer community and the expansion of the Ernie family of large language models position the company to provide the “underlying infrastructure” for the rollout of generative AI in China, according to co-founder and CEO Robin Li.
He added that the company was making its Ernie models “increasingly affordable and efficient,” which should lead to “even greater opportunities ahead.”

Sqreem Technologies, a Singapore-based company specializing in AI-powered digital behavior analysis, has announced its acquisition of TotallyAwesome, a Singaporean digital ad platform focused on marketing to Asia-Pacific youth.
The financial terms were not disclosed, though the TotallyAwesome team will join Sqreem’s global workforce.
The deal comes after Sqreem acquired Trade Indy, an advertising firm from Melbourne, in March 2024. In 2021, Sqreem also acquired Gamma SSP, a programmatic ad solutions firm.
The TotallyAwesome deal aims to combine Sqreem’s AI tech with TotallyAwesome’s user base to create “precision-targeted web environments for young users and their families.” It would also help Sqreem navigate ethical youth marketing amid rising global debates on responsible AI usage, especially around vulnerable audiences.
“Our combination of tech and expertise will demonstrate how brands can precisely tailor their engagement with kids, teens, and families while prioritizing safety and trust,” said Ian Chapman-Banks, co-founder and CEO of Sqreem.
Sqreem was founded in 2006 and provides B2B solutions using AI to analyze digital behavior. These solutions cater to enterprises in advertising and various other commercial fields.
TotallyAwesome, meanwhile, has worked with clients like Lego, Nerf, and Hot Wheels to build digital microsites, games, and quizzes for young audiences. It also provides consulting, media planning, and engagement services.

We break down the big and messy topics of Asia’s tech and startup community. Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a premium subscription.
Hello reader,
The general wisdom is that people mellow out as they get older. When I was younger, I thought this meant that adults just kind of experience relatively duller or muted emotions, but as I’ve grown up, I realized it’s more a function of knowing that good and bad things all come and go.
If everything goes in – more or less – cycles, then a turnaround from whatever crisis you’re going through is just right around the corner. Similarly, the best times don’t last forever. We also become more self-reflective, and we’re able to better see the objective reasons for why things happen. All of this means we tend to become a bit more level-headed as we get older.
Similar reasons explain Zomato’s turnaround from making a loss to becoming profitable – its effective use of analytics and its prioritizing of profitability over growth (which could be said to be the “boring” or “mature” thing to do) have been the keys to its success.
Perhaps the tech industry as a whole is also becoming more mature. If that means fewer shocks and more sustainable growth and practices, I’ll happily take it.
Today we look at:

Zomato’s comeback story
AnyMind Group’s continued ascent
Other newsy highlights such as Sea Group’s encouraging Q1 financials and a synthetic biotech startup’s US$15 million series A round

Comeback stories rule, dude

Image credit: Timmy Loen

It’s currently a pretty dire time to be a Manchester United fan, but with a history replete with dramatic last-minute victories, I think I – and so many of my peers – could be forgiven for falling in love with the club when I was a kid.
Everyone loves a fighter that won’t give up, and that currently describes Zomato to a T.


A low: A year after its IPO, Zomato’s share price dropped by over 60%, which was attributed to concerns over high valuations and the correction in growth stocks as interest rates started to rise. Investors were also underwhelmed by its US$568 million all-stock acquisition of quick commerce startup Blinkit, citing issues such as tight competition in the sector and significant cash burn.

It ain’t over yet: Zomato managed to reverse its fortunes and posted its first profitable quarter in the quarter ended June 2023, only two years after its IPO. Additionally, over the past year, its stock price soared by more than 200%, peaking at an all-time high of 197 rupees (US$2.40) at the close of trading on May 3.

How it did it: Advertising revenue has proven to be a key ingredient in Zomato’s recipe for profitability, while a substantial improvement in its quick commerce operations has also helped the firm’s turnaround.

Ecommerce enabler AnyMind Group recorded US$67 million in revenue for the first quarter of 2024, an increase of 60% year on year..
It also generated roughly US$2.3 million in operating profit for the quarter, reversing a loss of US$383,500 in Q1 2023.


An introduction: Based in Japan, AnyMind provides businesses with solutions for services like planning, ecommerce and D2C, marketing, manufacturing, and logistics.

Acquisition boost: For Q1, the group’s ecommerce unit logged the biggest increase at 82% year on year, which was partly due to its recent acquisition of ecommerce enabler Digital Distribusi Indonesia.

Acquisition boost, part 2? There can potentially be more growth to unlock for AnyMind, with its acquisition of Malaysia-based Arche Digital slated to be completed by Q2 of this year.

Porter, an India-based logistics startup, recently conducted a friends and family funding round, in which the startup was valued at US$1 billion, Moneycontrol reported. In the fundraise, around 15 to 20 individuals purchased secondary shares from Porter’s ESOP pool.
The company was last valued at US$500 million in its 2021 series E round, whose investors included Tiger Global and Peak XV Partners.
The report noted that for secondary share transactions, it is rare to charge a higher share price compared to institution-led rounds. However, Porter had also conducted a similar friends and family round in early 2023, during which it was valued at US$700 million.
Still, it appears that the premium may be a reflection of Porter’s recent performance. The company noted that its revenue reached US$21.1 million in 2023, up from US$10.2 million the previous year.
A source told Moneycontrol that Porter’s annual recurring revenue has grown 3x to 4x since its last ESOP liquidation.
An intra-city logistics startup, Porter began with building a truck driver network before broadening its operations to using two-wheelers. Additionally, it has collaborated with insurance firms and non-banking financial companies to provide short-term loans and vehicle insurance to its driver partners.
Since its 2014 launch, the company has raised a total of about US$150 million. Other investors include Kae Capital, Lightrock, and Mahindra Group.

Golden Gate Ventures, a Singapore-headquartered venture capital firm, has announced the first close of its US$100 million Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Fund 1, its first fund in the region.
The fund, which is based in Qatar, has US$20 million in commitments, reported the Gulf Times. Its anchor investors are Al Khor Holding, Al Attiya Group, and Sheikh Jassim bin Jabor al-Thani.
“The combination of a supportive government with progressive economic policies, a strong emphasis on diversification and innovation, a well-educated and diverse population, and a thriving entrepreneurial spirit positions Qatar for remarkable growth,” said Vinnie Lauria, founding partner at Golden Gate Ventures.
Greentech, alternative energy, and B2B artificial intelligence are among the sectors the fund is targeting in order to complement Qatar’s established natural gas and energy industries. MENA Fund 1 also eyes edtech, fintech, and healthtech investments.
Expansion has been on the menu for Golden Gate Ventures of late. It elevated partner Angela Toy to the COO post in March to support expansion initiatives, among others – the firm had also expanded into Vietnam, Saudi Arabia, and New York.
At the same time, the Middle East and Southeast Asia appear to be cultivating closer ties in tech investments. For instance, the likes of Shein, Lenskart, and Kakao Entertainment have all raised funds from Middle Eastern investors.

847911,2024-05-16T08:00:37,2024-05-15T06:03:03,How VCs can beat currency depreciation,vcs-beat-currency-depreciation,publish,post,https://www.techinasia.com/vcs-beat-currency-depreciation,"This story was republished with permission from The Realistic Optimist, a paid newsletter covering the global startup scene. It was moderately edited to reflect Tech in Asia’s editorial guidelines.
Emerging markets have long struggled to gain investors’ sustained trust. Even for the shrewd operators that can navigate political risk, inadequate infrastructure, and low buying power, the stubborn issue of currency depreciation remains.
Many emerging markets, including the most promising ones, suffer from a common ailment: Their currencies tend to lose value over time – and do so generally faster than in developed markets:

In 2014, US$1 was worth 8.5 Argentinian pesos. In 2023, it was worth over 800 pesos.
In 2014, US$1 was equivalent to 101 Pakistani rupees. In 2023, it was worth over 200 rupees.
In 2014, US$1 equaled 168 Nigerian nairas. In 2023, it was worth over 800 nairas.


Image credit: Timmy Loen

Investors in these markets need to make sure that their return on investment beats the depreciation rate. If it doesn’t, these investors will have lost money. If it does but only by a little, they might wonder if the trouble was worth it.
Yet, these markets keep galvanizing investors as the macro tailwinds are promising with vigorous economic growth, young populations, and a hunger for technology. So far, however, the investment vehicle that can ride those tailwinds while delivering compelling returns has remained elusive.
Most investment options in these markets remain institutional. Over the past 10 years, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index (which captures the performance of large-cap and mid-cap companies across 24 emerging markets) achieved net annualized returns of 3.01%. The S&amp;P 500, which measures the performance of 500 large US companies, returned 12.39% annually over roughly the same period.
The savvy investor might ask: Why take a risk on emerging markets in the first place, as the available investment options seem to deliver mediocre returns once adjusted for currency depreciation?
Enter venture capital.
Venture capital as a way to beat depreciation
Venture capital takes its roots in the whaling industry, a risky but potentially lucrative business. Investing in whaling meant betting on 10 whaling expeditions with the understanding that nine would come back empty-handed (or not come back), while one would bring back enough riches to net a return.
That same mentality applied to tech companies gave birth to venture capital. This entails betting only on companies with the potential and ambition to become industry leaders while accepting that most will fail entirely.
Venture capitalists don’t invest in stable, steadily growing businesses. They “go big or go home” by design.
Studies have shown that venture capital returns outperform that of public markets over five-, 15-, and 25-year periods. This suggests that investing in top-quartile VCs is a great hedge against most macroeconomic headwinds. The key skill is picking the right VC managers.
This begs the question: Can venture capital make the case for emerging market investing? Investing in winning tech companies seems to be a tangible way to ride macro tailwinds, while potential returns beat depreciation by a mile.
Primed markets
The case for venture capital in emerging markets presupposes certain conditions. The goal is to generate outsized returns that, even when accounting for currency depreciation, beat both S&amp;P 500 and VC returns in developed markets.
One way to do so is to fund companies that will ride tailwinds like growing economies, young populations, and increasing tech penetration. The companies best placed to service these trends are tech startups – more specifically, tech startups looking to become leaders in digitally virgin local verticals.
You want to fund the startup that will digitize all of Central Asia’s logistics companies, the startup that will digitally bank every Southeast Asian SME, or the startup that will pioneer telehealth for Africa. And you want to fund them extraordinarily early, to capture the extraordinary returns you’re aiming for.

Identifying the markets in which these startups exist but aren’t sufficiently funded is a subtle science. Some indicators help.
Smartphone and internet penetration above 30% is primordial. If it’s under 30%, the potential customer pool is simply too small. Once it crosses 60% to 70%, there is a critical mass to build digital businesses at scale.
The early presence of ride-hailing, food delivery, and digital payments apps is another great indicator. These apps don’t have to be mature – the earlier the better actually. What their presence conveys is that people use their phones for more than just messaging and social media.
Lastly, you need at least a semblance of government enthusiasm for the topic. This enthusiasm can vary in fervor, but a verbal commitment to digitalizing the economy is a minimum.
These are the markets in which venture capital makes a lot of sense. We call them “primed markets.”
Operationally speaking, for startups
Operating a startup in these markets requires a certain nous. The challenges faced there haven’t been faced in Silicon Valley, so the playbooks haven’t been written.
One of those big, novel challenges revolves around our issue of the day: currency depreciation. Startups have two broad ways to handle depreciation, which can be combined as the company grows.
The first is to sell their product in Western markets, bringing in “stable” currency revenue. Nigerian video-on-demand startup IrokoTV has pivoted from selling to Nigerians in Nigeria to Nigerians in the West.
This makes sense from an economic perspective. However, it means abandoning the emerging market-specific tailwinds that got founders and investors excited in the first place.
The second is straightforward: Grow faster than depreciation. In primed markets, startups aim to dominate digitally virgin industries. If they get it right, their growth should comfortably surpass depreciation.
Operationally speaking, for VCs
VCs have to adapt in two aspects.
First, factor in currency depreciation when negotiating a startup’s valuation and into the founders’ USD financial projections. Doing so builds in a margin of error for both the founders and investors.
Second, VCs need to take the average exit size into account. In primed markets, the startup phenomenon is new and therefore so are exits.

There are some exciting right-tail examples, such as IPOs from Grab (Singapore), Nubank (Brazil) and Kaspi (Kazakhstan). But realistically, the average exit size will be lower than in more mature markets. This should nudge VCs to take larger percentage ownerships in their startups, to ensure relevant returns in the case of said exit.
The adequate founders
Choosing the right founders is also tricky. That said, promising founders will likely fall into one of two buckets.
The first consists of foreign-educated and foreign-trained founders, who might know startup jargon like the back of their hand but might not possess localized business acumen. The other consists of locally born and trained founders, sagaciously operating locally but without the language and demeanor investors like to hear.
How an investor mixes and matches both types is more art than science. Generally, if you as a VC have to ask yourself whether the founder is great, they aren’t.
Who is buying this thesis?
All this being said, VCs need to convince their limited partners that this emerging market thesis is correct if they want to invest. So which kind of partners are most likely to buy in?
Let’s take local money, such as industrial conglomerates or family offices based in a primed market. They are tough to convince, as they typically prefer investing in real estate or back into their business rather than funding local startups that haven’t shown exit potential yet.

However, a small window of opportunity exists in these local business magnates’ offspring.
The Western-educated heir to the business might be more inclined to see the value in tech startups.
They generally have a small amount of discretionary money to invest. If they can get their foot in the door, and you deliver on your promise as a VC, maybe they can convince their parents to follow suit.
For large institutional investors, ticket and potential exit sizes might be too small in those markets. Once again, potential investors fall into one of two buckets.

The first bucket consists of investors who have made money in other emerging markets. They know that being early is everything and since startup business models across these markets tend to resemble one another, they will be reassured by investing in something they’ve already seen works elsewhere.
The second bucket consists of very large limited partners looking to diversify their portfolio. They might be curious about these markets but don’t have the bandwidth to set up a fund for them, so they will entrust a specialized VC to do so.
Risk versus reward
The excitement surrounding emerging markets has often been subdued by the fact that investments have not justified the risk associated with them. Even fast-growing businesses can have their returns wiped out by currency depreciation.
Fortunately, tech value creation is a far greater force than macro volatility. Betting early on companies digitizing entire industries amid a fast-growing economy makes sense.
VCs that targeted markets such as Latin America when they were “primed” are among the most consistently high-performing across all venture capital.
As the tech startup phenomenon globalizes, venture capital in these markets is also significantly de-risked. People’s needs worldwide are the same, and there’s no reason to reinvent the wheel.
The more track record a business model has globally, the more enlightened founders will be at implementing it locally. When there’s a will, there’s a way.

Amid rising geopolitical tensions between the US and China, online fashion retailer Shein has reportedly been considering a public listing in London listing instead of New York. However, Shein executive chairman Donald Tang declined to confirm the plans in an interview with the Financial Times, saying that the company wants to “explore all options.”
Tang added that while Shein has made some progress in changing the perception that the company is controlled by the Chinese government, it was not enough to change US lawmakers’ minds.
Shein started the IPO process six months ago, filing initial paperwork with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. However, despite being headquartered in Singapore headquarters and not operating in China, most of Shein’s suppliers are Chinese.
The US has tightened its grip on China-linked companies in recent months. Most notably, the potential ban of short-video app TikTok has been signed into law. But the company and some creators are taking legal action to block the move.
The US is also reportedly considering a 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars, a 4x increase compared to current levels.
As for Shein, the company reported a significant boost in net profit for 2023 despite challenges. Exceeding US$2 billion, the number is a substantial increase from the US$700 million it had recorded in 2022.

Indonesian telcos XL Axiata and Smartfren are in early talks of a potential merger, the companies said in a statement. Axiata Group, the Malaysian conglomerate that owns XL Axiata, and a consortium led by Smartfren parent firm Sinar Mas have signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding to explore the merger.
Both Axiata Group and Sinar Mas intend to remain as joint controlling shareholders of the resulting entity. The merger seeks to leverage Axiata Group’s telco expertise with Sinar Mas’ local scale and market knowledge.
The two parties have been in discussion about a merger since as early as 2021. Such a deal would potentially create a US$3.5 billion entity with 100 million customers.
Axiata Group said in the statement that XL Axiata is its largest asset, and Indonesia – where it also operates Linknet, Boost, and ADA – is its “highest value creator.” Apart from Indonesia and its home country, Axiata also operates in Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Sri Lanka.
XL Axiata is profitable, most recently earning US$34 million in net profits for the first quarter of 2024, out of US$530 million in revenue. Meanwhile, Smartfren recorded its first profit in 2022, but it reported a net loss of US$6.8 million last year.

The direct-to-consumer landscape in Indonesia amid funding drought
Shopee starting 2024 with strong results amid TikTok Shop’s threat


Hi there,
Many new F&amp;B brands are appearing on online food delivery platforms in Indonesia. These D2C players aim to ride on the momentum of people ordering food online, a trend that increased dramatically during the pandemic.
Most F&amp;B players are not backed by VCs. But in recent years, some F&amp;B startups, especially coffee chains, have attracted the latter’s attention. Jago Coffee, Kopi Kenangan, Flash Coffee, and Fore Coffee are some examples.
The D2C trend has also reached other consumer sectors, such as beauty, personal care, fashion, health, fast-moving consumer goods, furniture, and even electric vehicles. All are using online platforms to sell their products directly to consumers.
Funding into the D2C space in Indonesia is drying up compared to a few years ago, though. Yet, new names continue to emerge.
In this week’s Big Story, my colleague Budi maps out Indonesia’s D2C space, complete with a list of players in each category, funding details, and the latest trends in the industry. The story also highlights Indonesian brands expanding regionally and also some regional brands coming into the country.
Meanwhile, in the Hot Take, I analyze Shopee’s strong results for the first quarter of 2024, demonstrating its continued success despite the rise of TikTok Shop in Southeast Asia.

THE BIG STORY
Mapping Indonesia’s leading D2C brands

Between 2020 and 2024 so far, direct-to-consumer players in the F&amp;B sector attracted the most funding, followed by those in FMCG.

THE HOT TAKE
Shopee thrives despite TikTok Shop’s rise

Photo credit: Shopee

Here’s what happened:

Shopee’s gross merchandise value jumped 36% year on year to US$23.6 billion in Q1 2024.
Its revenue rose 33% to US$2.7 billion from Q1 2023.
Adjusted losses of US$22 million in Q1 2024 were a fraction of the previous quarter’s US$225 million, but still worse than the adjusted earnings profit of US$208 million from a year earlier.

Here’s our take:
Shopee began 2024 with a strong set of results after ramping up investment amid intensifying competition in August 2023.
For the first quarter of 2024, the ecommerce giant posted a positive adjusted EBITDA of US$11.5 million in Asia, although other markets remained in the red.
Forrest Li, founder and CEO of Shopee’s parent company Sea Group, stated that the operational priorities for the ecommerce arm this year are “enhancing” price competitiveness, “strengthening” its content ecosystem, and “improving service quality” for buyers.
During the company’s Q1 2024 earnings call, Li claimed that Shopee had become “the largest livestreaming ecommerce platform in Indonesia” based on the average daily orders made during livestreams in the period. This comes amid TikTok Shop’s efforts to regain growth momentum in the country after being temporarily closed from October to November last year.
Indeed, Shopee has made huge investments in livestreaming and short-form videos. It offers many discounts for purchases made through Shopee Live or Shopee Video – something its rival Lazada doesn’t do.

Meanwhile, TikTok Shop appears to be less aggressive in Indonesia compared to before the closure.
Several consumers told Tech in Asia that they have been using Shopee more frequently than TikTok Shop after the latter merged with Tokopedia, as “the discounts have become fewer.”
Some TikTok Shop sellers also pointed out that they haven’t been able to achieve the same sales levels as before October 2023, with many moving to Shopee.
In November 2023, venture builder firm Momentum Works projected TikTok Shop’s market share in Southeast Asia to reach 13.9% that year. Shopee led with 45.9%, followed by Lazada with 17.5% and Tokopedia with 14.2%.
GoTo CEO Patrick Walujo has repeatedly stated that the merger of Tokopedia with TikTok Shop will make them the market share leader in ecommerce in Indonesia.
However, in February, Walujo said Tokopedia’s market share had been diminishing, especially among price-conscious consumers, due to a reduction in incentive spend.
To recapture these sellers and users, TikTok Shop and Tokopedia likely need to become more aggressive, both in pricing and in seller and affiliate acquisitions. They have the benefit of Tokopedia’s strong ecommerce ecosystem, including logistics and payments, to compete harder with the market leader.
But for now, Shopee continues to be the leading ecommerce player in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia.

Indian insurtech firm Go Digit has secured US$141 million in pre-IPO funding, TechCrunch reported, citing a filing with the National Stock Exchange of India. Anchor investors in the pre-IPO round include Fidelity, Goldman Sachs, and HSBC, as well as several Indian mutual funds operated by banks like the State Bank of India and ICICI.
Go Digit’s IPO opened for subscription yesterday. The company aims to raise about US$313 million, a drop from its initial target of US$440 million in 2022, when it initially planned to go public.
The Mumbai-based firm delayed its listing at that time due to “poor market conditions.”
Go Digit offers auto, health, travel, and accident insurance. It streamlines the insurance purchasing process as it allows clients to self-check damaged vehicles, file claims, and request services online through an app.
The startup was founded by insurance veteran Kamesh Goyal in 2018. Some of its earliest backers include Peak XV Partners – formerly Sequoia Capital India and Southeast Asia – as well as Canada-based Fairfax Group.
As of 2023, Go Digit had roughly 43 million customers and issued about 8 million policies, according to the company’s prospectus.
India’s IPO space has been flourishing, becoming the world’s top IPO destination with 57 listings last year – despite a decline in VC investment. As Tech in Asia reported, part of the reason appears to be VC firms becoming more discerning in choosing companies to back.

After becoming EBITDA profitable in its last two quarters, Southeast Asian super app Grab has maintained its momentum, hitting US$62 million in adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2024. The amount is an all-time high, the company noted, and is a US$129 million improvement year on year.
This has led the company to revise its 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance upward, from between US$180 million and US$200 million previously to between US$250 million and US$270 million.
“Our focus on product-led growth is bearing fruit, with on-demand gross merchandise value (GMV) scaling to new highs in spite of the seasonal impact we usually see in the first quarter of the year,” said Anthony Tan, Grab’s co-founder and group CEO, in a statement. “Our push on affordability and reliability is pulling more people onto our platform and driving up order frequency.”
Peter Oey, Grab’s CFO, said that the company has repurchased US$97 million worth of class A ordinary shares in March, while paying down US$497 million of its term loan B. The share buyback is part of a US$500 million scheme first announced in February.
While Grab has not disclosed an official reason for the buyback scheme, it usually signals a company’s confidence that its stock would rise, at least in the short term.
Meanwhile, Grab’s revenue for Q1 2024 rose by 24% year on year to US$653 million, while loss for the quarter was US$115 million. The firm attributed the revenue result to growth across all segments along with a reduction in on-demand incentives – the latter stood at 9.7% of on-demand GMV, compared to 10.7% in Q1 2023.
Deliveries continued to be the largest revenue source, with US$350 million for the quarter. Mobility contributed US$247 million, though it recorded the highest segment adjusted EBITDA at US$138 million.
Financial services has continued to grow, though the unit is still adjusted EBITDA negative. Grab has made some recent moves in this segment, phasing out the GrabPay card in favor of its GXS digibank while adding crypto top-ups for its Singapore users.

This is an updated version of the article that was first published on November 25, 2021. Since then, several new startups and new funding rounds have been added to the list.
2023 was challenging for direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands in Indonesia.
For one, the Indonesian government had temporarily banned TikTok Shop, disrupting the sales for many brands.
Those in the beauty and personal care segments were particularly affected, as many of them livestream on TikTok Shop to showcase their products.
Funding value in D2C fell to US$82 million in 2023, plunging by nearly 70% year on year after reaching a peak in 2022, according to Tech in Asia data. Deal count also decreased by 57% during the same period.
This funding drought is likely to continue. After nearly five months into this year, only a handful of D2C players have raised funding from VCs. These include Gently, a babycare company that secured US$2.1 million in a round led by Northstar Group, and Tjufoo, a brand aggregator that bagged the same amount before announcing its merger with Indonesia-based B2B ecommerce firm Sinbad.

Nevertheless, the country’s D2C market size is expected to grow further. For example, compound annual growth rate in the beauty and personal care category is expected to jump by 7.8% between 2022 and 2027, according to a report by boutique investment bank Favour Capital.
The report also forecasts that the market sizes of two segments –  pet care and mom and baby – will increase by 22.5% and 13.4%, respectively.
Investor interest in F&amp;B
Compared to other D2C sectors, food and beverage (F&amp;B) has seen the most investor interest in recent years.
In April, mobile cafe startup Jago Coffee raised US$6 million. The company is hoping that its concept of deploying electric coffee carts around Jakarta can differentiate it from major competitors such as Kopi Kenangan and Fore Coffee, which have shifted their their attention to international markets.

Meanwhile, baby-food manufacturer Nayz recorded a 41% uptick in revenue to 22 billion rupiah (US$1.4 million) in the first half of 2023, following an IPO on the Indonesia Stock Exchange.
That said, the F&amp;B sector is not without its challenges. Flash Coffee, which has raised at least US$70 million since its inception in 2019, exited Singapore in October 2023, citing lackluster performance compared to its other markets. Just a month later, its Thailand business was acquired by Turn Capital.
The second-largest sector after F&amp;B in terms of funding size is fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG). One of the biggest rounds in the last five years was raised by e-grocery platform Sayurbox, which bagged US$120 million from Northstar, Alpha JWC Ventures, and other investors in March 2022.
FMCG firms also have their fair share of problems. For example, Sayurbox laid off several employees from its B2C team in April 2023. The company also merged some of its B2C warehouses due to stagnant growth in the segment, shifting its focus to B2B instead.
Meanwhile, Dropezy pivoted its quick commerce business to poultry processing and distribution in December 2023, following the closure of its dark stores across Greater Jakarta.
Another notable departure from the D2C space was furniture retailer Fabelio, which declared bankruptcy in October 2022 after months of unpaid employee salaries. However, other furniture brands like Dekoruma, which has aggressively opened stores in various cities across Indonesia, are still thriving.
Going regional
D2C firms are increasingly thinking global.
Alternative protein firm Green Rebel announced last year that it planned to launch in the Philippines and Vietnam, while fashion brand Claude set up shop in Singapore in July 2022. As of February 2023, seven months into its expansion, the city-state was the biggest revenue contributor among Claude’s international markets.
Esqa, along with other Indonesian beauty brands, entered Vietnam via the marketplace Sociolla. Esqa has been profitable since 2017, even before it raised US$6 million in 2022.

On the flip side, regional D2C firms are also expanding into Indonesia. One such company is Zenyum, an oral care startup based in Singapore. Its clear aligner business was launched in Indonesia in 2019.
Meanwhile, EV manufacturer Charged Asia – also from Singapore – set up shop in 2022 and had about 1,500 vehicles on Jakarta’s roads as of August 2023. That same month, the firm received US$40 million in funding from Indonesian coal producer Geo Energy Resources.
Charged Asia competes with local players like Volta and Electrum for a piece of the Indonesia’s emerging EV industry.

This is an updated version of the article that was first published on November 25, 2021. Since then, several new startups and new funding rounds have been added to the list.
2023 was challenging for direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands in Indonesia.
For one, the Indonesian government had temporarily banned TikTok Shop, disrupting the sales for many brands.
Those in the beauty and personal care segments were particularly affected, as many of them livestream on TikTok Shop to showcase their products.
Funding value in D2C fell to US$82 million in 2023, plunging by nearly 70% year on year after reaching a peak in 2022, according to Tech in Asia data. Deal count also decreased by 57% during the same period.
This funding drought is likely to continue. After nearly five months into this year, only a handful of D2C players have raised funding from VCs. These include Gently, a babycare company that secured US$2.1 million in a round led by Northstar Group, and Tjufoo, a brand aggregator that bagged the same amount before announcing its merger with Indonesia-based B2B ecommerce firm Sinbad.

Nevertheless, the country’s D2C market size is expected to grow further. For example, compound annual growth rate in the beauty and personal care category is expected to jump by 7.8% between 2022 and 2027, according to a report by boutique investment bank Favour Capital.
The report also forecasts that the market sizes of two segments –  pet care and mom and baby – will increase by 22.5% and 13.4%, respectively.
Investor interest in F&amp;B
Compared to other D2C sectors, food and beverage (F&amp;B) has seen the most investor interest in recent years.
In April, mobile cafe startup Jago Coffee raised US$6 million. The company is hoping that its concept of deploying electric coffee carts around Jakarta can differentiate it from major competitors such as Kopi Kenangan and Fore Coffee, which have shifted their their attention to international markets.

Meanwhile, baby-food manufacturer Nayz recorded a 41% uptick in revenue to 22 billion rupiah (US$1.4 million) in the first half of 2023, following an IPO on the Indonesia Stock Exchange.
That said, the F&amp;B sector is not without its challenges. Flash Coffee, which has raised at least US$70 million since its inception in 2019, exited Singapore in October 2023, citing lackluster performance compared to its other markets. Just a month later, its Thailand business was acquired by Turn Capital.
The second-largest sector after F&amp;B in terms of funding size is fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG). One of the biggest rounds in the last five years was raised by e-grocery platform Sayurbox, which bagged US$120 million from Northstar, Alpha JWC Ventures, and other investors in March 2022.
FMCG firms also have their fair share of problems. For example, Sayurbox laid off several employees from its B2C team in April 2023. The company also merged some of its B2C warehouses due to stagnant growth in the segment, shifting its focus to B2B instead.
Meanwhile, Dropezy pivoted its quick commerce business to poultry processing and distribution in December 2023, following the closure of its dark stores across Greater Jakarta.
Another notable departure from the D2C space was furniture retailer Fabelio, which declared bankruptcy in October 2022 after months of unpaid employee salaries.

As more and more people entered the global startup scene over the years, the concept of a “tech stack” has gained popularity. Developers like using these stacks as a standard set of tools – whether programming languages, databases, or other front- and back-end systems – that fulfill all their needs, helping them build their apps or other platforms in a faster and cheaper way.
With the advent of blockchain, it is perhaps inevitable that something similar would exist for Web3 developers. That’s the premise behind Singapore-based Chainstack, which provides tools and services that allow developers to create, deploy, and scale blockchain applications – without needing to manage the underlying infrastructure.
The company has secured US$6 million from investors such as SBI Ven Capital, Sygnum, Azimut Group, and Unicorn Factory Ventures. It will use the funds to improve user interaction and process automation, aiming to set new industry standards in performance, reliability, developer support, and cost-efficiency.
“We have not needed financial support because we’re a profitable company,” Jan-Jaap Jager, CEO of Chainstack, told Tech in Asia. “However, to achieve our goals, we wanted to bring some strategic partners to the table.”
Chainstack partners with over 25 public blockchains and serves over 100,000 Web3 developers. It said that it handles over 100 billion requests monthly with a 99.99% uptime.
Notably, the company’s annual net billings have grown by 62% on average over the last two years, and it experienced a 40% increase in paid customers from January to March 2024 compared to the same period last year.

A subsidiary of Vietnamese tech giant VNG has become Nvidia’s latest partner in Southeast Asia. GreenNode, an AI GPU cloud provider under VNG Digital Business, said that it has been providing the Nvidia H100 Tensor Core GPUs to business clients since April.
Anh Tung Vu, head of product at GreenNode, said the partnership is expected to facilitate the rapid adoption of high-performance AI models for enterprises in Southeast Asia, India, Australia, Japan, and Korea.
Southeast Asian countries are actively pursuing opportunities with the US chipmaker.
Last month, Vietnamese IT conglomerate FPT also announced a partnership with Nvidia, committing to spend US$200 million to build an “AI factory” in the country.
In April, Nvidia said it would co-invest US$200 million with Indonesian telco Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison to build an AI center.
Meanwhile, earlier today, VNG also inked a partnership with STT GDC to develop data center projects in Ho Chi Minh City. As part of this venture, STT VNG Ho Chi Minh 1 will have the capability to establish a direct peering connection to VNGGames and VNG Cloud.

Shopify has sued Singapore-headquartered Shopline for allegedly copying Dawn, the technology behind the former’s customizable storefront templates. The move comes a month after Shopline launched Seed, its own customizable storefront template, in the US.
In the lawsuit, Shopify said that Shopline is “distributing a thinly disguised knockoff” that still carries “damning evidence of Shopline’s wholesale copying.” One piece of evidence is that the name “Shopify” still appears in multiple instances of Seed’s code.
“To create Seed, Shopline started by making an unauthorized copy of Dawn, translated that unauthorized copy into a different programming language, and then made largely cosmetic changes to the Dawn code,” Shopify alleged in its 17-page complaint, which was filed to the US District Court for the Southern District of New York.
The Canada-headquartered ecommerce enabler further calls the evidence “overwhelming,” from the organization of Seed’s directory layout all the way to the developer pages, which are manuals to help web developers and merchants design their storefronts.
Having launched in Hong Kong and Taiwan, Shopline has since expanded to Southeast Asia and, more recently, to Australia and the UK. Its investors include 500 Startups, Ardent Capital, and the Alibaba Hong Kong Entrepreneurs Fund, a nonprofit initiative from Alibaba Group.
In 2022, Shopline was acquired by Nasdaq-listed Chinese livestreaming platform Joyy in a US$183 million deal. The acquisition was followed by a host of departures among its Southeast Asia-based employees, including all of the region’s country managers, as well as Shopline’s co-founders.

Hello reader,
My first IT lessons at school weren’t exactly thrilling.
After we filed in on day one and took our seats in front of one of the 30 or so computers in the room, our teacher proceeded to tell us we wouldn’t be turning the machines on for months. Instead, we would be taking notes from the already outdated IT textbooks he proceeded to hand out.
Safe to say, I didn’t particularly look forward to Mr. Fulton’s classes.
Nowadays, education systems worldwide have embraced technology with much more warmth than Mr. Fulton did, luckily for the students of today. That’s part of why edtech is big business in Southeast Asia. The region’s large population and growing middle class have played a part too.
As our featured story today dives into, though, funding for edtech startups has become much harder to come by amid the tech winter and the return of offline education with the Covid-19 pandemic in the rearview mirror.
Today we look at:

A lot has changed in Southeast Asian edtech since 2021, when Tech in Asia last published a landscape report on the sector.
Funding flow has slowed down amid the end of lockdown restrictions and the beginning of the tech winter, but there are still some reasons for optimism.


By the numbers: There’s no two ways about it – there’s a lot less funding to be had. Per Tech in Asia data, in 2021, Southeast Asian edtech firms secured US$948 million in funding. The figure for 2022 and 2023 was below US$148 million, down 8.5x from the heady days of 2021.

Green shoots: That being said, VCs still clearly believe the sector has some promising young players. Since the beginning of 2023, 71% of funding deals in the region have gone to early-stage startups. One example is Vietnamese educational content provider Vuihoc, which bagged US$6 million in a series A round in July 2023.

Comparisons: Southeast Asia’s edtech scene is still relatively nascent, but the funding winter has also hit more mature ecosystems hard. Tech in Asia data shows Chinese edtech firms raised only US$49 million in 2023, down from US$1.8 billion two years before. The funding drop has also been precipitous in India, going from US$5.1 billion in 2022 to US$527 million in 2023.

In the first quarter of 2024, Shopee had increased both revenue and gross merchandise value. For the ecommerce giant to maintain the growth, however, building a long-term “competitive moat” appears to be key.
Here, logistics appears to be playing an increasingly big role. Tony Hou, CFO of Shopee’s parent Sea Group, said during the latest earnings call that more than half of Shopee’s orders in Asia are fulfilled by SPX Express, Shopee’s in-house logistics arm.
The number is even higher in Brazil, where more than 70% of orders are served by SPX Express.
When asked how SPX Express contributes to better unit economics, Hou said that one fundamental reason is that third-party logistics (3PLs) charge a profit margin to their customers, whereas doing it in-house means “we retain that margin.”
This means that SPX Express’ cost per order is lower than 3PLs in the market. In addition, the cost per order also decreased by 15% year on year for Asia in Q1.
Doing logistics in-house also lets Shopee provide a “differentiating factor” in terms of service quality. Sea Group chairman and CEO Forrest Li noted that “in the first quarter, about 70% of SPX Express orders in Asia were delivered within three days of order placement.”
Logistics aside, the company also reported a 23% drop in spending on sales and marketing. This is partly because of better performance from the marketplace in general, said Hou, but also because of better unit economics from livestreaming.
The company touted its substantial investments in its livestreaming business in the Q3 and Q4 2023, which it said have started to bear fruit. Li said that based on the average daily orders made during livestreams, Shopee became Indonesia’s largest livestreaming ecommerce platform in Q1.
“I think we do see our livestream volumes still growing in most of our markets, but the unit economics actually improved significantly for various other markets,” Hou said.
Earlier this month, Tech in Asia reported about Shopee’s efforts to compete with TikTok Shop in its social commerce capabilities. Through incentives, Shopee has actively pursued creators in Indonesia, its biggest market, to jump ship and do its livestreaming on Shopee instead.

However, as industries such as ecommerce and fintech become more challenging for VCs to secure substantial returns, which sectors are investors banking on?

Image credit: Timmy Loen

The answer might lie in cleantech.
Tech in Asia data and interviews with regional VCs indicate that cleantech has emerged as the next hot category for tech investors in Indonesia. The urgency of addressing climate change, combined with government support for the sector, makes it an attractive investment proposition.
The rise of cleantech
In 2023, Indonesian cleantech startups raised a total of US$65 million in disclosed funding. This year, they’ve raised US$77.5 million so far, according to Tech in Asia data.

Swap Energy, an electric vehicle battery-swapping startup, secured one of the largest cleantech deals of the year so far. Its US$22 million series A round in January was led by Qiming Venture Partners.
Founded in 2019, Swap Energy aims to tackle charging infrastructure limitations in the electric two-wheel vehicle segment with its over 1,300 battery-swapping stations in Indonesia. Its EV partners in the country include Smoot and Minerva Electrons.

Helen Wong, managing partner at AC Ventures, agrees that renewable energy and electric vehicles remain hot sectors for funding in Indonesia. She said this trend has been bolstered by the success of similar companies worldwide.
However, Wong notes that founders should be aware of the “capital-intensive nature of cleantech” and the “longer time to market due to complex corporate sales cycles and an uncertain regulatory landscape.”
In recent years, Indonesia has rolled out numerous policies to push EV adoption, including cutting the value-added tax on sales of battery-based electric vehicles from 11% to 1%, as well as an electric motorcycle subsidy. President Joko Widodo has been vocal in his support of EVs, and his successor, president-elect Prabowo Subianto, will likely maintain this stance.

Tauhid Pandji, Wavemaker Impact’s country head for Indonesia, is optimistic about the potential influence of the country’s government policies in driving cleantech growth. Indonesia is targeting a 17% to 19% renewable energy share in its energy mix by 2025, after abandoning its previous target of 23%.
Another positive sign is reductions in technology costs, according to Pandji. He cited declining prices for solar panels, which fell by 50% globally in 2023, as well as for lithium-ion batteries, which fell to a record low last year and have been tipped to fall by a further 40% by 2030.
Fintech reality check
Fintech funding in Indonesia has noticeably decreased lately.
Based on Tech in Asia data, Indonesian fintech firms secured only US$850 million in 2023, roughly half of the US$1.7 billion raised in the previous year. In the first quarter of 2024, fintech funding in the country amounted to only US$174 million, down considerably from the US$361 million raised in Q4 2023.
Akulaku and Qoala accounted for the largest shares of Indonesian fintech funding in Q1 2024, raising US$100 million and US$47 million, respectively.

Pandji of Wavemaker Impact attributes “the apparent slowdown in fintech funding in 2024” to “market corrections after previous investment spikes.”
As for Wong of AC Ventures, she believes that the fintech sector’s concentrated funding is a result of tighter regulations and higher capital market requirements.
In February of this year, Indonesia’s financial services authority (OJK) introduced new regulations requiring fintech lenders to submit real-time data on their transactions to the OJK.
Last year, the regulator increased the minimum equity requirement for peer-to-peer lenders from 1 billion rupiah (US$63,900) to 2.5 billion rupiah (US$159,800). The figure will eventually rise to 12.5 billion rupiah (US$799,100).

That said, Wong believes that there are still opportunities for niche fintech players to address challenges such as credit scoring for Indonesia’s unbanked segments.

In 2022, AC Ventures co-led the US$2.2 million pre-seed funding round of SkorLife, which helps users check their credit scores from Indonesia’s bureaus as well as receive financial advice to improve their credit. The VC firm also participated in SkorLife’s US$4 million seed funding round in 2023.
Agritech, waste management: still untapped
Indonesia is Southeast Asia’s largest market for agritech startups, but funding remains scarce.
Tech in Asia data revealed that so far, the country’s agritech firms have secured a mere US$9.6 million in funding this year, starkly contrasting with the US$224 million that the sector raised in 2023.
However, US$200 million of last year’s funding came from eFishery’s series D round. This fundraise, which pushed eFishery to unicorn status, was an exception to the norm.
Despite this, the VCs we spoke to remain convinced that Indonesia’s agritech sector has largely been untapped.

Agriculture contributed 12.4% of Indonesia’s GDP in 2023 and employed 29% of the working population.
Melisa Irene, partner at East Ventures, notes that agritech firms need to address the conventional nature of agriculture: low transparency, volatility, and supply-demand issues. She adds that a growing number of these startups are tapping into AI, internet of things, and drones to boost farm yields.
For example, East Ventures invested in Aria, which offers farmers drone-spraying services, a data platform to boost farming efficiency, and a “digital agronomist” that can predict soil macronutrient levels. The startup counts the likes of Triputra Group, Asia Pulp &amp; Paper, Sinar Mas, and Bayer as its clients.
However, even well-funded startups seem to face challenges. For example, poultry startup Pitik laid off a number of employees in April of this year.
The company offers farmers livestock management tech, including IoT-based systems and tools. It raised US$14 million in a series A round led by Alpha JWC Ventures in 2022.

Waste management is also emerging as a niche vertical of interest for investors in Indonesia, despite the reality that funding for the sector remains extremely rare.
“We’re bullish on the waste management sector as there are still big problems to tackle,” says Irene. “Indonesia’s plastic recycling rate is only 7%, which is considered quite low compared to other Southeast Asian countries.”
With the country’s population producing 7.8 million tons of plastic waste per year and increased pressure on companies to meet EPR requirements, there’s no shortage of potential business opportunities.
Yet, it’s a challenging niche sector to navigate. Startups in waste management often grapple with the task of educating potential users about practices like waste segregation, all while striving to bolster participation levels.
Octopus, an Indonesian waste treatment startup, has recently faced allegations of unpaid salaries and other poor business practices.
The firm’s co-founder and CMO Hamish Daud stepped down in February citing “personal reasons.” A Tech in Asia investigation in January of this year also called into question the educational background of co-founder and CEO Moehammad Ichsan.
Tech in Asia data reveals only one Indonesian waste management firm secured funding in 2023. Rekosistem, which raised US$5 million in August of last year, provides waste management consultancy services using IoT and machine learning.
Still, Pandji of Wavemaker Impact expresses strong interest in companies capable of converting raw agricultural waste into higher-value products.
For example, one of the firm’s portfolio companies is WasteX, which turns agricultural waste into biochar, a type of charcoal made from various organic materials. This can be used to improve soil quality, plant health, and crop nutrition.

US-based TikTok creators have filed a suit in the US Court of Appeals to appeal the short-video app’s potential ban in the country, Reuters reported. The creators argue the law risks limiting free expression and “promises to shutter a discrete medium of communication that has become part of American life.”
While this comes on the heels of TikTok and ByteDance’s own lawsuit, TikTok creators have found success with their legal efforts in the past. In 2020, another group of creators filed a lawsuit against then-President Donald Trump’s executive order to ban TikTok, which the court eventually blocked.
In 2020, the Wall Street Journal reported that TikTok had footed these creators’ legal fees. It is unclear whether the same case applies this time.
TikTok’s legal battle in the US adds to the string of moves both the US and Chinese governments have made to protect the data and business of their respective tech companies.
President Joe Biden’s administration argued that it is not seeking a ban on the app, but instead a ban on its Chinese ownership. But ByteDance has countered that selling the app is not possible, practically or legally, partly because of its algorithms.
A previous report noted that instead of selling its stake in the US business, ByteDance may choose to leave the country altogether.

In its latest I/O conference, Google made it clear that it is in its AI era.
The tech giant has launched a wide range of AI products built on the latest iteration of its large language model Gemini, signaling its dedication to compete in the space. The announcement came a day after ChatGPT developer OpenAI’s launch of its new AI model, GPT-4 omni.
Google launched three versions of Gemini. The 1.5 Flash, which the firm says is the “newest and fastest” model, can summarize talks, caption photos and videos, and pull data from documents.
Meanwhile, the 1.5 Pro can take on more complex instructions, with use cases like crafting a chat agent’s “persona and response style.”
Finally, the Nano is a lightweight version of Gemini, which can process image inputs on top of text.
Gemini 1.5 Pro was built with a context window of 2 million tokens, which means it is processing that amount of text to come up with a response. The full 2 million token window is exclusively available to developers, while the 1 million token window of the 1.5 Pro and 1.5 Flash are available to the public for a fee.
Google also announced AI integrations with its Android operating system – including a homework helper system and a genAI assistant – as well as with its Search, Photos, and Workplace products. The latter allows users of Gmail, Google Drive, Google Docs, and other Workplace tools to use Gemini 1.5 Pro through each app’s side panel.
OpenAI’s GPT-4 omni, meanwhile, can accept input and churn out output in any combination of text, audio, and images. With this model, users can have a conversation with ChatGPT directly.

Ilya Sutskever, co-founder and chief scientist of OpenAI, is leaving the company. Jakub Pachocki, previously the AI firm’s director of research, will take over Sutskever’s chief scientist role, the company said in a statement.
The announcement comes just a day after OpenAI unveiled GPT-4 omni (GPT-4o), the first version of its advanced AI model, which can accept an input in any combination of text, audio, and image, and respond using a combination of these media.
Perhaps infamously, Sutskever led the board vote to fire CEO Sam Altman late last year, a move he later said he regretted.
A report from The New York Times said Sutskever remained an employee of OpenAI after the planned coup against Altman in November. But after Altman’s reinstatement, Sutskever never returned to work, with Pachocki filling in his role since then, the report noted.
In a letter to employees posted on OpenAI’s website, Altman called Sutskever “easily one of the greatest minds of our generation, a guiding light of our field, and a dear friend.”
Sutskever’s next act is something “very personally meaningful” that he will share more about in “due time,” he said in a post on X (formerly Twitter). However, The New York Times noted in its report that Jan Leike, Sutskever’s co-lead on OpenAI’s Superalignment team, also left the company.

Here are three key takeaways from Alibaba’s results from the fourth quarter of its 2024 financial year:


Strong revenue growth: Alibaba’s revenue increased 7% year on year for the quarter, standing at US$30.7 billion. This comes off the back of growth across the Chinese tech giant’s product lineup. For the full year, revenue grew 8% to US$130.4 billion.


Improving operational efficiency: There has been a significant improvement in income from operations, which has risen by 13% year on year to US$15.7 billion for FY 2024. Quarter over quarter, however, the figure decreased 3% to US$3.3 billion in Q4, which Alibaba primarily attributed to increased ecommerce investments and rising employee incentives.


Expansion and technological advancement: The company’s emphasis on AI and its integration across business segments such as Taobao, Tmall, and Cainiao can provide a solid foundation for future growth.

Rapyd has denied the allegations and is contesting the lawsuit. The company asserts that the ex-employee is not entitled to the stated payouts, which is calculated based on the volume of transactions flowing through its platform.

Arguing his case, Rapyd CEO and co-founder Arik Shtilman alleged in his affidavit that one of the company’s clients, which was brought in by the former sales staff, had engaged in “round-tripping” that appeared to be done “solely for the purpose of pushing up the amount” of transactions flowing through Rapyd.
Shtilman contended that these money flows, which amounted to US$934 million from two clients, were ineligible for commissions due to the terms of the company’s compensation plan.
The CEO added that they were simply “internal transfers of funds between bank accounts and/or virtual accounts owned” by the client, and didn’t create “viable revenue” for Rapyd. Round-tripping is also commonly understood to be an unethical practice designed to inflate revenues.

As this is an ongoing case, Tech in Asia is withholding the identity of these clients, who were named in Shtilman’s affidavit. We have also asked Rapyd to elaborate on the round-tripping claims and sought answers to other questions, but the firm declined to comment.
Meanwhile, the ex-salesperson said in his affidavit that the supposed instances of “round-tripping” were valid transactions and that the clients “were simply moving their funds and their customers’ funds around the globe” using Rapyd’s products, which include a multicurrency treasury.
According to a blog post on Rapyd’s website, its treasury solution is a “collection of cash management features” that allow users to “manage liquidity, balance currencies,” and “optimize the cost and effort of global payment operations.”
The former employee added that Shtilman had actually allowed these transactions and that Rapyd had facilitated them well into 2023.
Rapyd ascent
Headquartered in London, Rapyd was founded in Israel in 2016 by Shtilman, Arkady Karpman, and Omer Priel. It has offices in cities across the globe including Tel Aviv, San Francisco, Amsterdam, Dubai, and Singapore.
The fintech company also has payment licenses in the UK, Hong Kong, United Arab Emirates, and Singapore.
In March 2022, Rapyd reached a valuation of US$15 billion, which made it the highest-valued Israeli tech unicorn at the time.
After announcing a series E round worth US$300 million in August 2021, Rapyd launched an extensive marketing campaign to recruit employees.
“Like everything we do, we do it big,” wrote Shtilman on Linkedin.

A Rapyd employee recruitment campaign launched in 2021 | Photo credit: Rapyd

In October 2021, Rapyd started using a private jet with an estimated market value of between US$10 million to US$15 million, Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported. Over the next year, the executive jet logged 100 flights to places including holiday destinations in Spain, Greece, and Thailand.
Hack the Galaxy, one of the company’s largest “employment recruitment campaign” activities, was held in Lisbon, Portugal, in 2022. Rapyd had hosted a series of such events throughout the year, including one that featured famous DJ David Guetta.
In 2015, Forbes magazine predicted that Guetta show fees could be in the seven-figure range.

Rapyd’s Hack the Galaxy event in Lisbon

However, Rapyd was reportedly “preparing to” terminate 10% of its 900-strong workforce that same year.
At around the same time, the company was named in a couple of wage disputes in the US. One of the cases has since been dismissed because the claimant did not appear for a hearing. The other case remains open.
Tech in Asia understands that Rapyd is also involved in an ongoing salary and commission dispute with a European ex-staff. The contested amount runs to five digits in US dollars.
In August 2023, Rapyd announced that it was in the process of acquiring part of payments company PayU for US$610 million. The deal was to be financed through a capital raise of US$700 million.
The entities were set to make a combined US$500 million in revenue in 2023, according to Shtilman.
Commission dispute
In the Singapore lawsuit, the ex-employee alleged that Rapyd owed him money arising from multiple deals that he had brought in. So far, the company has paid him US$180,264 in commissions – just a fraction of what he is supposedly entitled to.
Besides commissions from clients that allegedly engaged in round-tripping, the former salesperson asserted that he is owed 0.1% of the US$216 million in transaction volume generated by Funding Societies, the Singapore-based SME digital financing platform.
Shtilman’s response was that the ex-employee wasn’t entitled to commissions as the Funding Societies deal was not entered into under “standard business terms.”
The deal was part of an overall arrangement in which Rapyd Ventures – the fintech firm’s corporate venture capital arm – subscribed to shares in Funding Societies.

Rapyd CEO and co-founder Arik Shtilman / Photo credit: Rapyd

According to Shtilman’s affidavit, Funding Societies had made only a single US$100 million transaction. The CEO said this was due to a contractual obligation in the deal stating that if Funding Societies processes less than a threshold amount through Rapyd within a certain time, the latter would be entitled to redeem cash from the subscribed shares.
Shtilman noted that Funding Societies “substantially” ceased further transactions via Rapyd after the initial transfer, which bolstered his view.
Because of the role that Rapyd Ventures allegedly played in closing the deal, Shtilman argued that it was “driven by a company team selling approach” that then allowed Rapyd to change the commission structure as it saw fit.
The former staff maintains that he is eligible for the commissions, stressing that “standard business terms” were not defined in the compensation plan, and that he closed the Funding Societies deal separately from Rapyd Ventures.
Negotiations break down
Both parties negotiated over the commissions from August 29 to December 4 in 2022. The ex-employee held fast to his demands to be paid US$1.1 million.
He claimed that in a meeting on August 29, Shtilman proposed paying him in tranches for one of the deals. However, the former salesperson said he declined the offer as tax rates would increase in 2023.
Citing his contemporaneous notes and subsequent text to associates, the ex-staff further alleged that during the same meeting, Shtilman had verbally agreed to pay him “100%” of the commission for the Funding Societies deal.
Shitlman, however, claimed no resolution had been reached during that meeting. “I can only believe that it must have been a misunderstanding on his part,” the CEO said in his affidavit.

India-based 9Unicorns has launched its second fund, 100Unicorns Fund II, with a target of US$200 million and an additional US$100 million greenshoe option.
The early-stage accelerator fund also rebranded to 100Unicorns to signify growth in the country’s startup scene, which has produced 111 unicorns.
100Unicorns was founded in 2020 by Apoorva Ranjan Sharma, Anuj Golecha, Anil Jain, and Gaurav Jain. It is backed by Venture Catalyst, a global startup accelerator.
To date, it has invested in over 140 startups in industries including fintech, edtech, Web3, and deeptech. Videoverse, Trunativ, and ZyppElectric are among the portfolio firms from its first fund.
In its initial funding stage, 100Unicorns typically offers investments ranging from US$300,000 to US$1 million per startup. However, the amount could increase to US$2 million in the later stages, with co-investors participating through its first fund.
The primary goal of the second fund is to support 200 Indian startups and “propel them to join the billion-dollar club over the next decade,” said Sharma.
100Unicorns is creating a platform similar to Y Combinator to help startups with funds and mentorship so they can graduate to the next level with a proper go-to-market strategy.
“We are building a platform where we can fund deals right from idea to series C,” Sharma said in a previous interview with Tech in Asia.

Here are three key takeaways from Tencent Holdings’ results from the first quarter of 2024:
1. Growth powered by ads revenue
Total revenues rose to US$22.5 billion, marking a 6% year-over-year uptick. This was driven by strong growth in Tencent’s online advertising business, which was up by 26% year on year to US$4 billion. The company attributed this to increased user engagement as well as an “ongoing enhancement” of its AI-powered advertising infrastructure.
2. Profit up by 30% year on year
The company’s non-IFRS operating profit jumped 30% year over year to US$8.3 billion, and the operating margin expanded to 37%. The growth in operating profit margins was attributed to “high-quality revenue streams” such as in advertising, platform service fees for its Mini Games business, and ecommerce tech service fees.
3. Investment in technology and shareholder returns
Management highlighted ongoing investments in AI technology, platform enhancements, and high-production-value content. At the same time, the company’s also focusing on shareholder returns through increased dividends and a share buyback plan with a target of over HK$100 billion (US$12.8 billion) for 2024. This showed up in the sharp increase in capital expenditures to almost US$2 billion in Q1 2024 from US$608 million in the same period last year.

Japan’s tech giant SoftBank is eyeing investments in Indian data centers and industrial robotics as part of its wider bet on AI-related infrastructure, Moneycontrol reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
SoftBank may invest between US$75 million and US$150 million per deal, the report said.
It may target data center businesses of big firms or manufacturing facilities that use AI and automation. This aligns with SoftBank’s global push toward robotics, AI, and self-driving cars.
As of the end of March 2024, SoftBank had committed US$5 billion in investments in these sectors, as well as logistics. Its recent investments include those in GreenBox – SoftBank’s joint venture with robotics firm Symbotic – and Wayve, a UK-based autonomous driving company.
Notably, with potential deals in India’s AI infrastructure landscape, SoftBank would end its two-year investment break in the country.
SoftBank had heavily invested in India’s consumer internet and SaaS sectors in the past. Four firms from SoftBank’s portfolio – Zomato, PB Fintech, Paytm, and Delhivery – are already public.
Earlier this year, SoftBank was considering raising US$100 billion for an AI chip venture that could rival US-based Nvidia. SoftBank-owned chip designer Arm Holdings is also expected to launch its first AI chips in 2025.

Overall revenue rose to US$3.7 billion, up 23% from Q1 2023. While adjusted EBITDA was down 21% year on year at US$401 million, it was 3.2x higher than in the previous quarter.
Similarly, the group swung to a net loss of US$23 million for the quarter compared to US$87 million in profit a year ago, but improved from Q4 2023’s US$112 million loss.
“We have a clear roadmap for profitable growth,” said Forrest Li, Sea Group’s CEO and founder. He added that the results were a “strong start to 2024,” with the company “well on track” to meet its full-year guidance.

Investors had sent Sea Group’s shares up by 17% in the trading sessions following the release of its 2023 full year results earlier this year, in response to the company’s positive outlook for growth at Shopee.
Indeed, much of the momentum behind the positive results this quarter came from the ecommerce arm, which saw gross merchandise value jump 36% year on year to US$23.6 billion for Q1 2024.
This helped drive Shopee’s GAAP revenue to US$2.7 billion, up 33% from Q1 2023. Meanwhile, adjusted losses of US$22 million in the quarter were a fraction of Q4 2023’s US$225 million, although worse than the adjusted earnings profit of US$208 million from a year earlier.
Bookings at gaming unit Garena came in at US$512 million, 11% higher than a year ago. However, GAAP revenue of US$458 million was down 15% year on year and 10% worse than the previous quarter.
Gaming companies tend to emphasize the importance of bookings, which are a non-GAAP metric, as they represent the actual value of purchases made during the quarter. On the other hand, under accounting rules, revenues depend on assumptions such as the estimated lifetime of a player.
Meanwhile, Garena’s adjusted EBITDA for the quarter stood at US$292 million, a year-on-year increase of 27%.
Finally, revenue at SeaMoney, the company’s financial services division, came in at US$499 million for Q1 2024, up 21% year on year. Its adjusted earnings of US$149 million were 50% more than the same year-ago period.
Initial reaction to the results appears to be positive, with investors sending Sea’s shares up by over 6% in pre-market trading.

Hello reader,
It might seem bizarre, but I think some of the most successful people on this planet get bored with their success.
Or more accurately, they get bored with repeating the same method that brought them success. The best example is probably Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola, who is notorious for tinkering with a winning formula at inopportune times.
There’s a fine line between innovating to stay ahead of the competition and deviating from what made you successful in the first place for no good reason. This is why it’s so impressive when leaders are able to fight off boredom to repeat their winning formula.
VC firm Square Peg Capital seems to have a formula that works for the company, with a solid internal rate of return of 44%. As today’s featured piece explores, for Square Peg’s sixth fund, the firm is sticking to a tried-and-tested recipe in terms of size and the sectors it’s targeting.
Today we look at:


Square Peg Capital setting sights on a sixth fund 
Vietnam-based VNG missing revenue target for 2023 despite the growth of its gaming unit
Other newsy highlights such as the US government considering more tariffs on key Chinese industries and an Indonesia regulator revoking lending platform TaniFund’s business license.

Square Peg looks for the right fit with new fund

Image credit: Timmy Loen

VC firm Square Peg Capital is planning to raise its sixth fund, and similar to its fifth, it’s aiming for US$550 million.
Fundraising is expected to start at some point in the second half of this year.


More of the same: Tushar Roy, partner at Square Peg, told The Business Times that the firm saw no need to aim for a larger fund size than its previous fund given the market environment. He added that the company plans to double down on markets across Australia, Southeast Asia, and Israel.

Game plan: For this fund, Square Peg will still focus on investing in companies in fintech, AI, software as a service, and climate tech, especially those with the potential to give above-average returns. So far, Square Peg has returned over S$1 billion (US$738.8 million) to investors from 16 exits.

No stock answer: To make exits easier to come by in Southeast Asia, Roy said it was important to improve the attractiveness of local stock markets as listing venues for tech firms. In his opinion, the best stock market for a tech company in this part of the world is the Australian Securities Exchange.

2023 in review for VNG

Image credit: Timmy Loen

VNG Corporation recorded net revenue of US$298.3 million in 2023, missing the US$393.3 million target it set in July last year.
The Vietnam-based firm also logged operating losses of US$82 million for the year, though it said the results were not comparable to 2022 due to a change in accounting policy.


Game on: The company’s gaming segment grew in 2023 after a flat 2022, while its international revenue improved, according to CEO Le Hong Minh. Game publishing arm VNGGames expanded its user base by 15%, hitting 78.7 million active users in 2023.

Message incoming: VNG’s messaging app Zalo reached 75.8 million quarterly active users by the end of 2023, up by 15% year on year. Profit from Zalo’s business communication platform, which had more than 20,000 business subscribers, increased 150%.

Efficiency: ZaloPay, the company’s digital payments unit, cut its operating losses by over 40% while its total payment volume rose 27%.

1️⃣ When two tribes go to trade war
The US government could be about to slap new tariffs on key Chinese industries like electric vehicles, semiconductors, and solar power machinery, sources told Reuters. The plan looks likely to continue existing tariffs, with a focus on fields related to strategic competition and national security.
2️⃣ Shutting up shop
Indonesia’s Financial Services Authority (OJK) has revoked TaniFund’s business license and required it to liquidate its business. The peer-to-peer lending platform, which operates under local agritech firm TaniHub, failed to meet the minimum equity requirements and to implement the OJK’s supervisory recommendations, said the OJK.
3️⃣ Chips are up
South Korea is the latest country to announce plans to spend big time in chip manufacturing research and investment, with a support package worth US$7.3 billion, Reuters reported. The country also plans to build a chip cluster complex in Yongin, part of the Seoul metropolitan area.

MoneyHero, a personal finance and digital insurance player, has appointed former Alibaba executive Hao Qian as its new CFO.
In his new role, Qian will oversee the firm’s financial operations such as accounting, capital markets, compliance, and investor relations. He will also assist in strategic finance initiatives such as forging partnerships and closing M&amp;A deals.
Prior to joining MoneyHero, Qian spent nearly eight years at Alibaba Group, where he served as CFO for Lazada in Singapore, Indonesia, and Vietnam. He also worked as a senior financial analyst at Amazon and as a market risk analyst at Credit Suisse.
Established in 2014, MoneyHero provides personal finance aggregation and comparison services. In October 2023, it listed on the Nasdaq through a SPAC merger with Peter Thiel-backed Bridgetown Holdings.
The group’s revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 stood at approximately US$35 million, a 50% increase from the same period in 2022. Revenue for its Singapore business more than doubled over the same period.

AnyMind Group said it grew its revenue in the first quarter of 2024 by 60% year on year to 10.5 billion yen (US$67 million).
Meanwhile, the company generated roughly US$2.3 million in operating profit for the quarter, reversing a loss of US$383,500 in Q1 2023.
Its gross profit also improved by 57% year on year to US$24.3 million, while its adjusted EBITDA stood at US$4.3 million, which was US$3.1 million higher than the previous year.
Based in Japan, AnyMind Group provides businesses with solutions for services like planning, ecommerce and D2C, marketing, manufacturing, and logistics.
The company said its three core business units continued to grow on a gross profit basis. Its ecommerce unit logged the biggest increase at 82% year on year, which came off the back of financial contributions from continued customer growth and from its recent acquisition of ecommerce enabler Digital Distribusi Indonesia.
Meanwhile, AnyMind’s marketing unit grew 42% year on year, driven by a boost in influencer marketing offerings. Its partner growth arm, which umbrellas its services for publishers and creators, jumped 73%, attributed to growth in new mobile app publishers and global creators.
There can potentially be more growth to unlock for AnyMind, with its previously announced acquisition of Malaysia-based ecommerce enabler Arche Digital slated to be completed by Q2 2024.

Delivered every Tuesday via email and through the Tech in Asia website, this free newsletter breaks down the biggest stories and trends in emerging tech.

Hello,
I’m one of those tech journalists who can’t get behind the whole electric vehicle craze. The idea of waiting for hours while the car charges up in the middle of a road trip? Not my idea of fun.
And then there’s the price tag. Paying a premium for a vehicle that’s not exactly practical? It’s a tough sell for me.
The only thing that caught my attention about EVs was the swappable battery concept in two-wheelers. You roll up to a battery station, swap it out, and you’re on your way!
But as they say, the devil’s in the details. Turns out, setting up a network of swapping stations and keeping enough batteries on hand is no cheap feat. Singapore’s EV ecosystem is learning that the hard way.
In our first Big Story this week, my colleague Melissa takes a deep dive into why battery swapping is facing some headwinds in Singapore’s EV market. She looks at the recent exit of battery-swapping firm Mo Batteries and analyzes the hurdles that the technology faces in the country.
Meanwhile, in our second Big Story, my colleague Peter delves into Southeast Asia’s edtech scene. Despite being one of the most well-funded sectors during the pandemic, it’s now seeing a decline.
Tech in Asia’s data shows that funding in the sector has plummeted by over 8x in the last two years. The number of edtech funding deals in Southeast Asia has also dropped significantly.
Finally, in AI Odyssey, I discuss why OpenAI’s consideration to allow adult content generation in its products might be a recipe for disaster.

THE BIG STORIES
1️⃣Battery swapping faces uphill climb in Singapore’s EV market

Singapore’s rules for electric vehicles are “high on safety” and “robust,” but they “didn’t fit together” with Mo Batteries’ model, its co-founder says.

The sector is struggling amid the tech winter and the return to offline learning. But signs of optimism remain despite the reduced funding and deal count.

AI ODYSSEY
Promising AI projects we’re noticing
OpenAI’s next move could see uptick in AI-generated porn
The Khajuraho temples in the Madhya Pradesh state of India are known for various erotic sculptures. The temple is said to have been constructed between AD 900 and 1130.
And that affirms my hypothesis that no matter the creative tool that humanity gets, they’ll try to make porn out of it. It’s no wonder the earliest adopters of any new technology is the adult industry.
That’s true for 28,000-year-old rock paintings and – as it turns out – it’s also true for generative AI. In the last few months, I’ve seen numerous reports signaling an uptick in AI-generated porn.
Students in New Jersey, for instance, have already been reportedly creating and circulating AI-generated pornographic images of their classmates.
There are also Telegram bots that can generate pornographic deepfakes for just a fraction of a dollar.
Just last week, OpenAI mentioned in an update that it is now considering whether users should be allowed to create AI-generated content that’s not safe for work (NSFW) – which includes erotica, extreme gore, slurs, and unsolicited profanity – with its products.
The ChatGPT developer is exploring the possibility of providing the ability to generate NSFW content in contexts appropriate for certain age groups. “We are eager to gain a better understanding of user and societal expectations regarding model behavior in this area,” the company said in a statement.

Image credit: OpenAI

OpenAI released a document where it showed how different prompts about potentially NSFW topics can produce different results. The company said that it’ll be strict on restricting deepfakes, and the examples it showed provided responses that were as per educational guidelines.
That, however, doesn’t mean that other platforms haven’t seen this educational route being misused for proliferating pornography. Instagram, for instance, went in a similar direction and allowed educational adult content. Today, the platform is filled with pornographic content despite its no nudity rule.
Likewise, users can force a genAI model to generate porn with the help of prompt injection. This involves manipulating or altering the input prompt, which is the initial set of instructions or data provided to an AI model.
This manipulation is done to influence or control the output produced by the AI. For instance, a Reddit user was able to generate a guide on how to make a bomb via ChatGPT, while another user was able to get ChatGPT to reveal the process to make meth.
While OpenAI says they are open for discussion on whether or not it should allow NSFW content on its products, I would say it’ll be a recipe for disaster.
Already, there is a 149% rise in reported “sextortion” victims since 2019 due to deepfake technology. Any mass product generating even educational adult content will not help – especially with OpenAI soon rolling out its text-to-video model Sora.

Cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and KuCoin are now recognized virtual asset service providers allowed to do business in India, The Economic Times reported, citing a government official.
A ban on KuCoin’s website was lifted after the company payed a fine of US$42,509, while Binance is also set to return once the size of its fine is decided, said Vivek Aggarwal, director of India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU).
With new regulations, the FIU can now fully track transactions on these platforms. Aggarwal said that these exchanges will also need to submit reports of suspicious transactions soon.
The FIU currently supervises 47 entities trading and managing crypto assets in the country.
In January, the Indian government had banned some offshore cryptocurrency platforms – including Binance, KuCoin, Huobi, Gate.io, OKX, Bitstamp, and Kraken – from operating in the country as they did not adhere to the FIU’s and anti-money laundering regulations.
While Bitstamp and OKX have wrapped up operations in India, Gate.io and Kraken are still in conversations with the FIU.
Meanwhile, in the US, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao was given a four-month sentence after pleading guilty to breaking US anti-money laundering rules. Binance was also banned in the Philippines earlier this year.

Odette works for a Singapore-based small business that sells unique batik fashion pieces made in Indonesia. In true small business fashion, she wears many hats at the company, overseeing marketing while supporting the sales and customer service teams.

Odette / Image generated with Midjourney

Throughout Odette’s day at work, she uses different platforms and tools to carry out her tasks. These tools are essential to small businesses, as they help employees work more efficiently.
“Imagine being a mechanic with the greatest ideas but without tools. It will take them forever to bring those ideas to life relying only on manual labor – this is what happens to a lot of SMEs, so having the right tools makes a difference,” says Matts Fievez, Asia-Pacific managing director at Odoo, a platform offering a suite of business management tools.
While these tools do make a difference, too much of a good thing can cause problems. Let’s look at Odette’s day in detail to learn more.
(P.S. Before we go any further, note that Odette and the company she works for are entirely fictional. Any resemblance to real-life people, events, or businesses are purely coincidental.)
A day in the life of Odette
Odette starts her day by checking her email. She’s liaising with some physical retailers in Singapore to see if they’re open to carrying the company’s products. She does that while updating a spreadsheet to keep track of who responded.
She gets a ping on the company’s messaging app, where several colleagues are asking her about the upcoming Summer Sale. The pricing strategy was discussed in a channel on the app, so she has to go dig that out. The marketing plan is up on the shared drive, but for the life of her, Odette can’t figure out where exactly they’ve put the numbers for the discounts they’re doing during the sale – was it shared on the drive or over email?
Then Odette gets an email from the company designer – the marketing collaterals for the Summer Sale are done and shared through a cloud storage platform. She checks on them to make sure they’re looking good.

Image generated with Midjourney.

Odette takes a quick break from her usual work to help with some purchasing tasks – the colleague who usually handles this is on maternity leave, so Odette is helping to manage the bills from international suppliers and ensure the company has the materials it needs for the next collection. These are all on a platform she isn’t familiar with, so navigating it is difficult.
Back to the collaterals – now that they’re done, Odette needs to schedule them using the social media scheduler and set up the electronic direct mailers for the campaign through an email marketing platform. And while she’s thinking about social media, there’s a bunch of messages from customers on Instagram. Someone wants to know if the items really come from Indonesia, and another person is wondering if the Floral Summer Dress will be back in stock in a size L… and it’s all quite overwhelming.
Odette tries to check the inventory management platform, but she can’t figure out how it works, so she messages the person in charge of inventory to ask.
Before she can get back to her marketing, there’s another ping from the founder, who asks if she knows that the intern double-replied a customer with conflicting information about the returns policy because they didn’t realize that Odette had already answered that question via Facebook.
Odette’s exhausted, and it isn’t even lunchtime yet.
Too much going on at once
Odette has a lot on her plate, and the sheer number of platforms and tools certainly doesn’t help. Communicating with colleagues aside, it’s clear that she spends a lot of time tracking down information scattered across different platforms and apps.
“According to BetterCloud, in 2022, businesses used an average of 130 SaaS applications, ” says Fievez. “Most small businesses nowadays run their companies with numerous standalone apps, but they’re not doing so in the most efficient manner.”

A study found that workers toggled between different apps and websites nearly 1,200 times a day, spending almost four hours a week reorienting themselves after switching to a new app. This doorway effect could impact productivity too – how many times have you switched apps at work and forgotten what you were going to do?
Having too many disparate tools can also influence a team’s ability to communicate and collaborate, as well as how they feel about work.
“In the long run, this affects company morale by increasing stress and frustration over ineffective communication and overwhelming workloads,” Fievez explains.
Streamlining the process
Managing these tools effectively is therefore essential. Businesses should streamline the number of apps they use and ensure that their teams are operating on the same platforms – for example, instead of some people using Dropbox and others using WeTransfer, everyone should agree on one service.
Another solution is to find services that provide multiple tools within a single platform. Odoo, for one, offers a comprehensive suite of business management apps that address multiple needs.

“Businesses can choose and integrate the specific modules they need, making it a flexible and customizable solution,” Fievez adds.
Odette’s company, for example, could leverage Odoo’s customer relationship management, ecommerce, accounting, and messaging tools to streamline its operations.
Additionally, companies should use platforms designed to be as consistent as possible, hence making it easy for users to navigate and minimizing the doorway effect.
“With an easy-to-use, intuitive, and colorful user interface, Odoo is more ‘instinctive’ for workers to navigate,” shares Fievez.

For Odette, this means that instead of struggling with the inventory management software and having to ask a colleague for information, she can access details easily because the app is laid out in a similar way as the marketing platform she uses daily.
Odoo also facilitates cross-department collaboration – the finance team doesn’t have to ask about everyone’s bills because it has access to the platform, and each team can easily generate reports about their activities for the company’s founder, thus reducing back-and-forth and data inconsistency.
To a more comprehensive experience
According to Fievez, aligning the tools a company uses is crucial in driving growth.
“With scattered tools and teams operating in silos, businesses often find themselves spending more time on cross-checking or manual approval rather than improving quality of services and strategizing upcoming plans to grow the team,” he says.
Eventually, this leads to delayed decision-making, reduced autonomy, and low morale that ultimately impacts what the company can achieve, he adds.
Taking a comprehensive approach to business management solutions doesn’t just make workers more efficient, but it also makes them happier – and that’s good news for Odette, her co-workers, and the company she works for.

Uber Technologies is planning to acquire Foodpanda’s Taiwan business for US$950 million in cash. The deal, subject to regulatory approval, is expected to close in the first half of next year.
Once completed, the deal is said to be one of the largest international acquisitions in Taiwan. Also, Uber plans to purchase US$300 million in new shares from Delivery Hero, Foodpanda’s parent company.
Delivery Hero said in a statement that it will continue operating Foodpanda Taiwan until the closing of the sale. After this, Foodpanda Taiwan’s consumers, merchants, and delivery partners will be transferred over to Uber Eats.
The acquisition aims to combine Uber’s efficiency with Foodpanda’s wide Taiwanese network. According to the statement, consumers would also benefit from Uber’s northern Taiwan network combined with Foodpanda’s deep southern presence.
Delivery Hero CEO Niklas Östberg said the company will focus resources on other global sectors “where we feel we can have the largest impact for customers, vendors, and riders.”
In February this year, Delivery Hero said in a statement that it ended talks with “the main negotiating counterpart” in a potential sale of its Foodpanda operations in some Southeast Asian markets. Östberg said at the time that Delivery Hero’s Asia-Pacific business was “strongly positioned to drive profitable growth at scale.”
While he didn’t disclose the negotiating counterpart, Delivery Hero had reportedly been speaking to Grab about the sale.
However, Delivery Hero said it was still open to merger and acquisition deals that “can create value to shareholders and with high certainty of closing.”

SoftBank Group currently has a US$183.6 billion portfolio with 477 companies, a factor Vision Fund CFO Navneet Govil believes gives the Japanese investment giant an edge over smaller rivals in the realm of AI, the exec told Reuters.
Govil said that with its size, SoftBank can rally its portfolio firms to give it a better grasp on how they can use generative AI and large language models. “When you have 477 portfolio companies, you can facilitate synergies, which isn’t possible if you’re a smaller platform,” he added.
However, the CFO said that the Vision Fund is not yet investing in companies based on how they fit into this ecosystem of AI-powered businesses.
The exec added that SoftBank is measuring the potential revenue gains of its portfolio firms by deepening the connections between them. These firms can be customers or suppliers of one another, or help each other break into new markets. To date, SoftBank has brought in 50 of its portfolio companies to Japan.
While the exec noted that SoftBank has been investing less recently, the group still injected roughly US$4 billion into companies in each of the last two years.
The Vision Funds posted an annual gain of 724.3 billion yen (US$4.6 billion) in the financial year ended March 2024. This reverses a loss of US$33.8 billion in the previous financial year.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman / Photo credit: Y Combinator

Open AI has unveiled GPT-4 omni (GPT-4o), the first version of its advanced AI model.
GPT-4o isn’t confined to text, the AI research lab says. It can accept input in any combination of text, audio, and image, and can churn out any combination of these media.
With this new model, users can have a conversation with ChatGPT directly. “The new voice (and video) mode is the best computer interface I’ve ever used,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a blog post. “Getting to human-level response times and expressiveness turns out to be a big change.”
With an average response time of 320 milliseconds, GPT-4o is designed to match human response times in conversations. It outperforms its predecessor, GPT-4 Turbo, with non-English content, but matches it in performance on text in English. GPT-4o is also 50% cheaper to deploy.
Safety was a priority in GPT-4o’s development, which included post-training model refinement and training data filtering, OpenAI said. Over 70 external experts reviewed the model as well.
GPT-4o can be accessed on the ChatGPT platform beginning today. Developers can also access GPT-4o in the API as a text and vision model, with its new audio and video capabilities slated to launch later to a group of trusted partners.
The new model’s launch comes after OpenAI rolled out Sora, a model that can create videos from text, in February.

In Southeast Asia, education is big business.
That’s no wonder, given how the region has a population of more than 690 million as well as a growing middle class with rising incomes and aspirations that’s looking to spend on their children’s education. These are among the reasons why online education in Southeast Asia is projected to exceed US$2 billion in revenue by the end of this year.
Despite this positive outlook, many edtech players in the region seem to be facing headwinds. While the sector was flush with VC money until 2021, funding has plummeted in recent years.
Tech in Asia data shows that funding value hit below US$148 million in the last two years, tumbling by more than 8x from its peak of US$948 million in 2021. The number of edtech funding deals also dipped by over 3.5x.

While lockdowns during the pandemic created a rush towards online learning and spurred investment in edtech, money has been less forthcoming since the return to offline education. In addition, the tech winter has not spared the sector: Tech in Asia data shows that several startups mentioned in our 2021 edtech landscape map have become inactive, ceased operations, or pivoted their business.
Some examples include Indonesia’s Zenius, which had temporarily halted its services starting January amid operational challenges, and Vietnamese edtech platform Kyna, which has pivoted to focus on online English teaching with Kyna English.
Besides this, many other edtech firms had to cut jobs and scale down. Indonesian edtech major Ruangguru, for instance, laid off hundreds of employees in 2022. Another player from the country, Binar Academy, reduced its headcount by 20% that same year, while LingoAce terminated hundreds of staff in 2023.
See also: Misfires and failed bets: why school’s out for Zenius after 20 years
That said, VCs seem to still believe in edtech’s promise as they have backed new players in Southeast Asia. Early-stage companies have secured the majority of investments, according to the chart below.

One such startup is Vuihoc, which provides educational content such as video lectures and quizzes to users in Vietnam’s Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. It raised US$6 million in a series A round in July 2023.
There was one large late-stage deal last year: Vietnam’s EQuest Education Group US$120 million fundraise in March 2023. MindX, another edtech firm based in the country, scored US$15 million in a series B round the following month.
In terms of where the investment is flowing within the region, it’s perhaps no surprise to see Singapore-headquartered firms on top of the list, attracting US$982 million in funding over the last three years.

That said, a large chunk of the funding in Singapore came from one deal: Emeritus’ US$650 million round. But even excluding this deal, Singapore still is the top investment destination for edtech, drawing over 2x the amount of funding received by Vietnam, which is no. 2 on the list. Indonesia follows closely at third place.
Since 2000, Vietnam’s government has committed to spending 15% to 20% of its annual budget on education, making the country an attractive market for private investment.
Meanwhile, having the largest population in Southeast Asia – more than 279 million – makes Indonesia a natural destination for edtech inflows.
A similar view from China and India
Southeast Asia’s edtech scene is still relatively nascent compared to those in China and India. However, the tech funding winter has affected the sector in these markets.

In 2021 and 2022, funding for India’s edtech industry dwarfed that of Southeast Asia’s. But it was a different story last year as funding for India’s edtech firms shrank by almost 10x, while deal count was slashed by more than half.
The post-pandemic return to offline learning contributed to Indian edtech’s funding slump, while the 99% drop in valuation of embattled unicorn Byju’s was also a factor in turning investors off the sector.

After years of outstripping Southeast Asia, funding and deal count in China’s edtech industry have fallen behind since 2022. The decline came after the 2021 “Double Reduction” education reform, which pushed for changes such as banning K12 tutoring businesses from raising funds through stock listings and foreign capital.

With eight investments, Indonesia-based East Ventures has been the most active investor in Southeast Asia’s edtech space since the start of 2022. Singapore-based VC Antler ranked second on the list.

Photo credit: Shutterstock

The US is likely to impose a 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars, a 4x jump from the current 25% rate, sources told Financial Times (FT).
The hike, along with tariffs on other greentech products from overseas, is expected to be announced soon, the report noted.
China’s increased production capacity – a move supported by its government – may lead to an oversupply of cheap EVs in global markets, according to FT.
The potentially higher tariffs could have stemmed from China seemingly overtaking the US in the cleantech industry, including solar panel production. It may also boost Democrats’ anti-China image, in turn affecting the upcoming US presidential elections.
“A quadrupling of this tariff rate, however, would more effectively shield US auto manufacturers from unfairly traded Chinese vehicles before they can gain a foothold in the US market,” said Wendy Cutler, vice president and managing director at the Washington, D.C. office of the Asia Society Policy Institute.
In April, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also voiced concerns about China’s global market power during her visits to Guangzhou and Beijing.
The US and China have already locked horns over a potential ban or forced sale of TikTok in the US. The short-video platform and its parent firm, ByteDance, are pursuing legal action in in response to this matter.

Jejakin, a climate tech startup based in Indonesia, has raised US$2.7 million in a funding round joined by Indogen Capital and East Ventures, among others.
Indonesia is among the countries most susceptible to the effects of climate change, such as rising sea levels, harsh weather, and farming disruptions, according to a report from the Asian Development Bank.
Jejakin can mitigate these effects by helping businesses compute their operational emissions, oversee climate actions, and contribute directly to climate change abatement strategies.
Apart from running carbon offset marketplace CarbonSpace, Jejakin also enables business to implement and track sustainability initiatives.
The fresh funds will be used for tech research, development, and market expansion. Since Jejakin was established in 2018 by Arfan Arlanda, Sudono Salim, Andreas Djingga, and Haris Iskandar, it has onboarded clients like Gojek, BCA, and Telkomsel.
Jejakin supports the Indonesian government’s measures to combat climate change, such as setting up a carbon exchange that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions for certain sectors such as energy and manufacturing.

Photo credit: Housing and Development Board’s website

The Housing and Development Board (HDB) of Singapore has unveiled a new resale flat listing (RFL) service, which lets homeowners list their flats for sale or hire an estate agent for the job.
Called the HDB Flat Portal, the platform enables buyers to browse and compare new and resale flat options. Meanwhile, homeowners will be able to automatically fill listings with details such as the address, flat type, and floor area using HDB’s data.
Sellers will also be notified if they list a price more than 10% above the highest recent nearby price, making for a “more sustainable property market in the long run,” according to HDB.
Although a soft launch of the HDB Flat Portal has already occurred, the official unveiling is scheduled for later this month.
The free service aims to create a “transparent, reliable, and trusted marketplace” for listing and transactions of HDB resale flats, the board said.
The list of flats available for sale on the open market will be consolidated with the current data on the HDB flat portal, which includes new build-to-order flats, loan services, and financial tools. Sellers need a valid intent to sell, and buyers need an HFE letter to access the full suite of services.
Such a platform is poised to directly compete with established property portals in the city-state, such as PropertyGuru and 99.co. The former previously said that it is exploring M&amp;A options as well as AI integrations to boost its business.

SoftBank’s Vision Funds have posted an annual gain of 724.3 billion yen (US$4.6 billion) in the financial year ended March 2024, over a loss of US$33.8 billion during the previous financial year.
This result included gains associated with the Vision Funds’ investments in chipmaker Arm and other subsidiaries of SoftBank.
For the quarter ended March 2024, the two Vision Funds, including the LatAm funds, reported a loss of US$369 million on investments.
However, both Vision Funds sold a total of US$22 billion in investments in FYE March 2024. This includes full exits from 17 portfolio companies, including Arm, as well as partial exits from other portfolio firms.
While Vision Fund 1 has investments in companies such as ByteDance, DiDi, GoTo, and Grab, Vision Fund 2 has made bets on Carro, Cars24, and Flipkart.
Overall, SoftBank Group reported a net income of US$1.3 billion for FYE March 2024, a turnaround from a US$5 billion net loss in the previous financial year.
SoftBank has been making a shift in its strategy, focusing on an AI-centric portfolio. Founder Masayoshi Son is reportedly considering raising US$100 billion for an AI chip venture that could rival US-based Nvidia.

We break down the big and messy topics of Asia’s tech and startup community. Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a premium subscription.
Hello reader,
I’ve read somewhere that when really successful people start getting into things that aren’t within their domain of expertise, it’s akin to having finished the “main quest,” spending their time relaxing and completing “side quests” instead.
Think of how someone like Bill Gates decided to just spend the rest of his life on philanthropic endeavors, or famous actors and actresses opening their own cafes.
For some Asian sports stars, their side quest comes in the form of working in the VC space, setting up their own investment firms and  backing startups. Today’s story takes a closer look at these efforts and what drives these sporting icons to throw their hat in the ring.
Today we look at:

Asian sports stars joining the world of VCs and startups 
Fragrance subscription firm I’vre shutting down
Other newsy highlights such as Motherswork’s new offline store in Vietnam and Line Man Wongnai’s potential IPO in 2025


Premium summary
A different ball game

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Some big names from the sporting world have gotten into the VC space, including the likes of Joseph Schooling, former competitive swimmer and Singapore’s first Olympic gold medalist, and Keisuke Honda, a former member of Japan’s national football team.
Tech investments are a different ball game compared to sports, so what’s driving these stars to join the fray?


Star power: Being famous in their own right gives many of these athletes an edge when investing in startups, as they can capitalize on that fame to secure competitive deals, according to VCs and analysts Tech in Asia spoke with. 

Big fishes, smaller pond: Unlike the US, Asia is a much less saturated space for celebrities in the VC space. Sports stars in the region can thus command a lot more attention when they’re trying to get in on the latest deals. 

Staying focused: Now that they’ve retired, many sports stars are simply looking for something to stay active in, even if it’s not physical. One former athlete told Tech in Asia that while she could no longer compete in sports, she can remain sharp through investing.

I’vre causes ire

Image credit: Timmy Loen

I’vre, a high-end fragrance subscription service based in Singapore, has closed its business. The move comes amid a police inquiry into complaints of wrong charges and uncompleted orders. Let’s take a closer look underneath all the chaos.


Word against word: I’vre co-founder Christian Kwok told The Straits Times that the company has honored all remaining orders and refunds. However, some customers have told the publication that they are still waiting on repayments.

Unwanted attention: In December 2023, the company started being investigated by the police due to customer complaints about unfulfilled orders and refunds. 

O$P$: Tech in Asia previously reported that several former employees were still owed salaries for October and November 2023. Kwok said at the time that I’vre would pay out the salaries it owes.

Bangladesh-based B2B platform ShopUp said its revenue stood at US$129 million for its 2023 financial year, up from US$83 million in FY 2022. Vashistha Maheshwari, the firm’s CFO, said that the company turned monthly EBITDA positive in December 2023.
“Our focus on positive unit economics has led to gross margin positivity and reduction in our adjusted losses for the FY ending June 2023,” added Maheshwari.
ShopUp merges finance, transaction processing, and supply chain services. This model builds a link between brands, factories, and small businesses with its microfulfillment centers.
The firm offers these services through the Mokam, Redx, and Onkur brands.
Currently, ShopUp runs 427 centers, serving 31 million people in Bangladesh. The company said it plans to increase its centers to 700 by December 2025.
It also aims to roll out its business in other developing markets, focusing on the Gulf region.
Afeef Zaman, ShopUp’s CEO, said that “SMEs are the cornerstone of economic prosperity in these regions, and our aim is to empower them, driving growth and creating value across emerging markets.”
The development follows the company raising US$30 million in debt funding last year, consisting of US$20 million from UK-based debt provider Lendable and US$10 million from Bangladesh’s The City Bank.
Other backers of ShopUp include Peter Thiel’s Valar Ventures and Peak XV’s Surge.

Hello there,
I rarely pay attention to ads. In fact, if I search for something and see an ad as the first result, I almost always skip to the first “real” search result.
My aversion to ads certainly isn’t stopping platforms like Zomato (ZOMATO, NSE), the Indian food delivery giant, from expanding their advertising businesses.
As my colleague Samreen shares in this week’s featured story, a recent survey found that nearly 63% of respondents already advertised on Zomato’s platform in March 2024. This was up from 54% in September 2023.
The company’s success in attracting advertisers is but one of several factors that have driven its share price to all-time highs this month. Over the past year, it has gone up by more than 200%, outperforming the benchmark Nifty 50 index. This marks a big change from its initial performance after going public in 2021 – shares had plunged by over 60% in the year that followed.
Find out more about how Zomato engineered this remarkable comeback – and whether this is sustainable – in Samreen’s piece.

THE BIG STORY

From bust to boom: Zomato turns the tide
Ads revenue, the Blinkit acquisition, and data analysis have helped turn Zomato’s fortunes in a few months after the post-IPO crash

3 Trends to keep an eye on
Hot stocks, earnings reports, restructuring, pressure from activist investors, and more.

Line Man Wongnai CEO Yod Chinsupakul / Photo credit: Line Man Wongnai

1️⃣ Line Man Wongnai reiterates IPO plans : The CEO of the Thailand-based food delivery platform said the company plans to go public in 2025 on either a Thai or US exchange, adding that a dual listing was also possible.
This is broadly in line with what Line Man Wongnai’s CFO told Tech in Asia in an interview last September.
A listing of the firm, valued at over US$1 billion, would be another significant milestone for Southeast Asian tech. Unlike companies like Sea or Grab, Line Man Wongnai is currently focused only on the Thai market, although it may consider expanding into other Southeast Asian countries post-IPO.
The hit in share prices that public Southeast Asian players have suffered will affect the valuation that Line Man Wongnai can hope to attract from public investors. Yet, if interest rates start to go down over the next few months, 2025 might prove as good a time as any to list.
2️⃣ SGX: a dose of reality: Every few years, stakeholders seem to freak out about the state of Singapore’s equity markets and propose various tonics aimed at reviving trading volumes and the number of public listings.
In the latest example of this, a Financial Times report stated that the city-state’s government agencies were studying proposals by an investor association to shake things up.
However, Lawrence Wong, who takes over as the country’s prime minister later this week, injected some realism into the debate recently. In his response to a parliamentary question, Wong noted that stock exchanges in developed markets such as the UK and Hong Kong were facing challenges, too.
It’s hard to see how Singapore can ever compete with what Wong noted was the “deep and liquid capital market and investor base” in the US.
That won’t stop people from trying. And once in a while, such measures might actually bear fruit: corporate governance reforms in Japan are cited as contributing to improved performance of the local stock market, although other factors such as a reallocation of assets from China have also played a part.
But bear in mind that Japan remains one of the world’s largest economies, home to many world-beating enterprises.
Perhaps the key to reviving markets in Singapore is to improve the performance of the companies already listed there. For example, DBS (Do5, SGX) delivered a record first quarter profit recently and was rewarded with a S$100 billion (US$74 billion) market capitalization – unprecedented for a Singapore firm.
3️⃣ GoTo’s private placement: Indonesian tech firm GoTo Group (GOTO, IDX) announced that it intends to issue 120 billion shares, 10% of its total issued and paid-up capital, via a private placement.
While the exact price it plans to sell these shares at was not disclosed, this may net the company around US$500 million, going by its closing share price on May 9.
Previously, GoTo had announced up to US$200 million of share buybacks.
Typically, companies buy back shares with excess capital that they do not need and wish to return to shareholders. Why launch a buyback if you are then going to raise even more capital from investors?
The opportunity for the private placement might only have come about after the buyback decision was made. However, this does raise questions about how the company is thinking about capital allocation.

The one you didn’t see coming
We spotlight the story that had everyone talking and social media buzzing during the past week.

Photo credit: Apple

Apple causes a stir with new iPad ad: To launch its latest iPad Pro model, Apple (AAPL, NDAQ) CEO Tim Cook posted a new ad on social media.
Set to the tune of All I Ever Need Is You, a 1972 single from pop duo Sonny &amp; Cher, the ad shows various items humans have used to entertain and educate themselves over the years, from musical instruments to books, and even an old-school arcade video console.
However, the twist is that these items are being crushed by a giant compressor.
Particularly poignant is a yellow ball representing an emoji that gets compressed till its eyes pop out.
What’s left at the end? The new ultra-thin iPad.
Some have criticized the video for depicting the “wanton destruction” of these historical items and lacking respect for creative equipment and creators.
Even those who understand what Apple is trying to convey say that it doesn’t resonate.
So what is the company really trying to say? Simply that the iPad is an all-in-one destination for education, entertainment, and expressing creativity. Few people would dispute that. But the choice of song does make one feel nostalgia, and a sense of loss – despite the title.
And maybe someone should have rethought the optics of squeezing a lovable emoji till it exploded.
Whatever the case, Apple has apologized for having “missed the mark” with the ad. This fracas isn’t likely to hit iPad sales materially – as they say, there’s no such thing as bad publicity!

That’s it for this edition – we hope you liked it!
Happy investing and see you next week!

Vietnam-based VNG Corporation generated net revenue of US$298.3 million in 2023, below the US$393.3 million target it had set in July last year. It also logged operating losses of US$82 million and a post-tax net loss of US$91 million for the full year.
However, due to a change in accounting policy, VNG said its results for the year are not comparable with its numbers from 2022.
CEO Le Hong Minh, however, said that the company’s gaming segment grew in 2023 after a flat 2022, while its international revenue continued to improve.
The firm’s game publishing arm VNGGames grew its user base by 15%, reaching 78.7 million active users in 2023. Bookings – a metric that estimates cash spent by users – also hit US$311.6 million, a 20% rise year on year. Over 26% of bookings came from international markets.
The company also introduced 10 new games and collaborated with Riot Games to publish League of Legends and Teamfight Tactics in Vietnam.
“We also continue to invest in innovation and growth engines such as AI and enterprise products,” Le added. “All of these will underpin VNG’s success in 2024 and beyond.”
Zalo, VNG’s messaging app, also reached 75.8 million quarterly active users by the end of 2023 – a 15% improvement year on year.
Profit from Zalo’s business communication platform, which had over 20,000 business subscribers, surged 150%.
Notably, ZaloPay, VNG’s digital payment service, cut down operating losses by over 40% while increasing total payment volume by 27%.

South Korea plans to roll out a support package focused on chip manufacturing research and investment, which will cost over 10 trillion won (US$7.3 billion), Reuters reported.
Finance minister Choi Sang-mok said that the country will reveal more details on the plan soon. With this initiative, the government aims to boost the semiconductor supply chain, focusing on chip materials, essential equipment makers, and fabless companies.
The minister suggested that sector-specific policy loans might be a part of the scheme. These loans may come from a fund co-financed by the government and private institutions.
Additionally, South Korea intends to build a chip cluster complex in Yongin, which is part of the Seoul metropolitan area. This complex is expected to create at least 3 million jobs over 20 years.
In January, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol had already announced plans to prolong tax credits for investments in the local semiconductor sector, which aims to stimulate job creation and attract skilled professionals to the industry.

This surge goes beyond the recent global and domestic enthusiasm for Indian equities. The benchmark-based index Nifty 50, for instance, only advanced by around 20% over the same period.

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Zomato’s bull run is not a flash in the pan. Investment bank Goldman Sachs recently raised its stock target price for the company to 240 rupees (US$2.90), up from the previous 170 rupees (US$2), and a further upside of 22% from the current all-time high.

Reversal of fortune
The 18 months following Zomato’s US$1.2 billion public listing  in 2021 had not painted such a rosy picture.
A year after its IPO, the company’s shares plunged by more than 60%, thanks to concerns over high valuations and the correction in growth stocks as interest rates started to go up.
Investors were also underwhelmed by Zomato’s US$568 million all-stock acquisition of grocery delivery startup Blinkit, citing issues such as tight competition in the sector and significant cash burn.
But loss-making Zomato reversed its fortunes and posted its first profitable quarter in the quarter ended June 2023, only two years after its stock market debut.
“No one expected Zomato to become profitable so quickly,”Pushkar Singh, co-founder of startup advisory and investment firm Tremis Capital, tells Tech in Asia.

How did Zomato thrive in the highly competitive food delivery and quick-commerce sectors, especially considering that its primary competitor, Swiggy, recorded losses of US$200 million in the nine months to December 2023?
Ads, acquisitions, analytics
Advertising revenue has proven to be a key ingredient in Zomato’s recipe for profitability. This involves restaurants running ads on the Zomato app to enhance their visibility.
“It is a very high-margin vertical, and almost the entire growth [in revenue] flows through directly to the bottom line,” Abhisek Banerjee, internet lead analyst at ICICI Securities, tells Tech in Asia.
Zomato does not disclose separate figures for its ads business in food delivery, but for reference, ecommerce titan Amazon’s ads business is estimated to have “well over 50%” operating margins. This is comparable to Zomato’s overall adjusted earnings margins of around 3.5% in the quarter ending December 2023.

Photo credit: Shutterstock

Zomato’s ads business operates on a revenue-per-click model, with the company charging a specific amount from restaurant partners based on each click generated by the ad.
Ad intensity on food aggregator platforms has “increased significantly” between September 2023 and March 2024, according to an ICICI Securities survey shared with Tech in Asia.
Out of the 220 restaurants across 40 cities in India that participated in the survey, nearly 63% said they were advertising on food aggregator platforms in March compared to 53% in September last year.
Advertiser experience had improved from 88.1% to 90.7% positive experience during the period, the report noted.
“It’s a lever that continues to grow and excite the markets,” Banerjee says.
However, running too many ads runs the risk of turning off users. For example, Amazon has been criticized for “no longer giving customers what they want” as ads have pushed out actual search results.
A substantial improvement in its quick commerce operations also contributed to the success of Zomato’s stock.
When the company bought Blinkit in 2022, the value of the acquisition was not immediately apparent to many. It was even written off as a “poison pill” for Zomato, requiring high levels of investment and presenting logistical challenges.
However, Blinkit is now proving to be an elixir for its parent firm. Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal even went so far as to say that Blinkit could become bigger than Zomato’s food delivery business in a year.

Zomato also expects Blinkit to turn profitable on an adjusted EBITDA basis by Q1 of its financial year 2025.
Blinkit dominates India’s quick commerce market, capturing 46% of market share by gross merchandise value in the quarter ended December.
The primary driver behind Blinkit’s success is its average order value (AOV), which is currently around 630 rupees (US$7.5). In comparison, the majority of customers who use quick commerce have an AOV ranging from 200 (US$2.40) to 400 rupees (US$4.80).
This can be attributed to the platform’s extensive range of products – possibly around 10,000 SKUs – that, in turn, enhances the value of each transaction.
Zomato’s “effective use of analytics” is also crucial in shaping Blinkit’s success, according to Banerjee of ICICI Securities. By analyzing granular data, Zomato can identify the distinct preferences of different localities, enabling it to cater to specific product demands effectively.
Prioritizing profitability over growth has also contributed to its success. In early 2023, Zomato announced that it had ceased operations in 225 smaller cities as its performance in those areas was “not very encouraging.”

That same year, the company also implemented a platform fee of 2 rupees for customers to drive its net profit margin. The fee, which has gone up over time, currently stands at 5 rupees.
Further increases in mandatory fees could eventually backfire for Zomato. However, this has not yet proved a huge deterrent for the company’s core base: urban consumers, who are prioritizing convenience over discounts for now, explains Satish Meena, an India-based analyst with Datum Intelligence.
Mostly outperforming global peers
As a result of the measures outlined above, Zomato now has some of the highest expected revenue and adjusted earnings growth rate among its listed global peers between 2024 and 2026.

The positive sentiment surrounding Zomato and the food delivery industry in general bodes well for Swiggy, as the SoftBank-backed company prepares for a US$1.2 billion listing.
Although Swiggy is not yet profitable, it is a major player in the sizable Indian food delivery market. In the first half of 2023, it commanded approximately 46% of the market compared to Zomato’s 54% share.

The duopolistic nature of the market should bolster Swiggy’s case for its upcoming IPO.
Investors’ bullish outlook on Zomato’s Blinkit is also likely to be positive for Swiggy, especially considering that it also operates a quick commerce vertical called Instamart on its platform.
Instamart is currently the no. 2 player in the quick commerce sector, capturing 27% of the market share. It trails behind Blinkit, which has 46%.
Following Zomato’s lead, Swiggy has also begun offering partner restaurants data-derived insights to assist in making expansion decisions.

However, Singh of Tremis Capital remains unconvinced that food delivery platforms have fully grasped how to achieve the optimal unit economics for their businesses.
He emphasizes the need to further refine data for demand prediction, inventory management, and operational logistics, which includes determining the appropriate number of active stores and delivery fleets.
But for now, the market appears to be counting on Zomato’s continued success, and Swiggy may benefit from this enthusiasm, too.

Hello reader,
I recently got back to work after a few weeks away on military reservist.
If there’s one thing that being back in green has taught me, it’s that you really can’t judge a book by its cover. That unassuming corporal could be a robotics engineer in his civilian life, while the charismatic lieutenant could be between jobs, delivering food for Grab in the meantime.
I’m not passing any value judgments on what’s a “good” job or not – all this just shows that you can never really tell what’s beneath the surface. As you look at the big numbers in this newsletter, remember that there’s a ton of moving parts and unknown people keeping things going behind the scenes for these firms.
Let’s not forget the efforts of the people on the ground even as we celebrate these milestones.

Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (OJK), Indonesia’s financial services authority, has revoked the business license of TaniFund, a peer-to-peer lending platform operating under local agritech company TaniHub.
The company failed to meet the minimum equity requirements and to implement OJK’s supervisory recommendations, the regulator said in a release. TaniFund is also obliged to liquidate and establish a center for information and public complaint services for the public.
OJK said it had progressively imposed administrative sanctions on TaniFund, limited its business activity, and consistently communicated with the company.
However, the regulator said that “by the specified deadline, the management and shareholders failed to resolve the issues, resulting in the revocation of TaniFund’s business license.”
TaniFund has struggled with bad credit. Local media outlet Kompas noted that from October 2022 to early 2023, its 90-day repayment success rate had declined from 50% to 36%.
By the end of 2022, OJK had received 29 customer complaints against TaniFund concerning default cases. Later on, a group of TaniFund lenders reported the platform to the police, with 14 billion rupiah (US$872,900) in losses between 129 investors.
TaniFund parent TaniHub has conducted at least two rounds of layoffs. Several of its C-level executives have also left the company amid allegations of misused VC funds by the management.
TaniHub most recent funding round was in May 2021, when it raised US$65.5 million from MDI Ventures, BRI Ventures, and other investors. Apart from TaniFund, the company also offers ecommerce and logistics support through TaniHub Food Solutions and TaniSupply, respectively.

Photo credit: Line

The Japanese government is said to be “effectively” pushing South Korea’s Naver to sell its shares in Line’s holding company, Korean news outlet Hankyoreh reported.
Following a data leak that affected Line’s Japanese users, Japan’s Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications issued orders to Line operator LY Corporation to reform its corporate structure, among other things. LY Corporation is a subsidiary of A Holdings, which is a joint venture of Naver and SoftBank Group.
While the Japanese government hasn’t explicitly asked Naver to sell its stake, local industry sources have taken the move to be an order for Naver to transfer its stake to SoftBank.
Japan’s Personal Information Protection Commission has also requested an investigation into Naver’s role in the Line data breach. The commission’s South Korean counterpart hasn’t responded yet, according to sources.
Korean insiders and experts have found it unusual for a foreign government to influence a domestic company’s actions, the report said. However, the South Korean government has remained mostly quiet.
While Line is headquartered in Tokyo and is Japan’s most popular messaging app, it began as part of a South Korean gaming company called NHN Corporation, which was Naver’s predecessor. Line has since grown far beyond a social app, having ventured into food delivery, digital banking, and blockchain.

Private equity and venture capital firms are increasingly going global, investing in companies across multiple countries, or even continents. But much of the back-end administrative work is still done either in a more laborious, manual way, or in a way that requires several different platforms or tools.
That’s the premise behind Singapore-based Linnovate Partners, which bills itself as a premium servicing firm for alternative assets. The firm uses technology to help its institutional clients manage fund administration, investor relations, and regulatory compliance, among other things.
Linnovate Partners has recently closed a US$40 million funding round from SeaTown Holdings, a Temasek affiliate, through its SeaTown Private Capital Master Fund. The fintech firm will use the money to scale operations, among other things.
Founded in 2016 by Henry Lin, Linnovate Partners also offers portfolio monitoring and reporting services. They are supported by the company’s cloud-based platform called Raise, which consolidates all the functions needed for alternative investing into one system.
In addition to Singapore, the company has multiple offices globally, including in London, San Francisco, and Shanghai, according to its website.
Currently, Linnovate Partners administers over US$130 billion in assets for its clients, which number more than 600 private equity and VC funds. Prior to founding the firm, Lin was a managing director of France-based alternative investment management firm eFront, which was acquired by BlackRock in 2019.

Photo credit: Shutterstock

US President Joe Biden is about to announce a new tariff scheme targeting key Chinese industries, such as electric cars, semiconductors, and solar machinery, sources told Reuters.
The plan is likely to continue existing tariffs, though there appears to be a focus on fields related to strategic competition and national security. While the Office of the US Trade Representative gave the recommendations awhile back, Biden’s announcement has been delayed after internal debates.
The tariffs differ from what was suggested by former president Donald Trump, which would apply to all Chinese exports rather than specific sectors. Biden’s officials, however, believe this measure might trigger inflation.
The US is also said to be reviewing Chinese activities in the shipping and logistics industry, which may lead to extra levies. These steps may trigger a response from China, adding to the already high tensions between the world’s biggest economies.
China has been dominating EV production and sales. In 2023, the country accounted for 60% of global EV sales, and brands like Wuling and BYD have pursued growth in countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia.
BYD in particular has been a major competitor to Tesla: The former overtook Tesla as the leading EV maker in the fourth quarter of 2023, though Tesla regained the position in Q1 this year after the Chinese brand’s sales plummeted by 43%. Nonetheless, BYD’s rise has prompted Western automakers to adapt their EV strategies to stay competitive.

Hello reader,
I once asked an ex-colleague what his dream job or career path was.
His reply? “I want to be a CEO.”
That felt extremely wrongheaded to me, especially since he didn’t have an answer when I asked what kind of company he wanted to found or lead. This was like the career version of form over function – it sounded like he just wanted the glamor and prestige that comes with the title without thinking about how he could help others or solve problems.
I think that acting without a sound motivation or intention in place only leads to pointless pivot after pointless pivot, causing harm to others along the way. Just think about all the companies that expanded furiously just because funding was cheap and easy to get and have had to conduct layoffs in the last couple of years. It is downright irresponsible.
This may explain both the recent reticence of VCs to invest in Indian companies as well as a potential bounceback in the coming years as more firms focus on achieving profitability and sustainability. Check out today’s premium article for the details.
I guess money eventually talks – I just wish it would reply faster instead of only thinking up the right response hours after the party, in the shower.
Today we look at:


Why VCs are holding off investing in Indian companies for now

Life is just cycle after cycle

It’s a tale as old as time. Work hard to build something from scratch; the good times come and hubris takes over; a crash and burn; then we rebuild again.
That seems to be happening in India’s tech scene. The more things change, the more they stay the same, and all that.


Very public: The country was the world’s top destination for IPOs in 2023, with 57 listings that collectively raised 494.3 billion rupees (US$5.9 billion). This was an upswing from 40 IPOs in 2022. However, VC investment in India actually declined nearly 63% between 2022 and 2023, while deal count fell from 1,611 to 880. Average deal size also dropped from US$16 million to US$11 million during the same period.

Mo’ money, mo’ problems: According to industry observers Tech in Asia spoke to, since 2023, VCs in India have become more discerning of the businesses and founders they back because many of their past investments have fallen short of their expected returns. Scott Shleifer, a senior advisor at Tiger Global, also noted that many startups in the country faced governance issues and struggled to achieve profitability.

Sustainable growth: Nevertheless, companies that have prioritized profitability over growth are now lining up their IPOs for 2025. Firms such as payments platform MobiKwik and travel tech startup Ixigo, which delayed their public listing plans to get into the black, will now pick up the pace and go to the market, as they have turned profitable.

Azara AI, a Singapore-based no-code AI platform, works much like a chatbot: Give the platform a prompt and it will generate the solution for you.
The startup, which has started generating revenue, has also raised US$1 million over the past year.


Roll call: Investors include Singapore-based VC firm Iterative VC, 500 Startups founder Dave McClure, Untapped Capital’s Yohei Nakajima, and angel investors from Meta and Airbnb.

How can I help you today: According to Azara AI’s website, the platform has “AI agents” that are specialized on a number of company needs such as customer service, operations, and human resources. The company claims that when given the right prompts, these agents can be integrated into a business’ existing workflow, automate tasks, and process data.

Connecting muscle: “Azara generates workflow, writing the code behind the scenes and intelligently routes to all the plugins your business already uses,” co-founder and CEO Jason Sosa says in a video.

The Malaysia-headquartered used-car marketplace also said it has sold more than 500,000 cars since its 2015 founding, with 150,000 of them sold last year. Meanwhile, revenues from Carsome Capital surged by over 80% in 2023, marking the second year in a row of net profits for Carsome’s financing and insurance arm.
2️⃣ Big (drop) if true
Oyo is in talks to raise funds at a valuation of US$3 billion or less, TechCrunch reported, citing people briefed on the situation. The amount is a far cry from the India-based hospitality firm’s US$10 billion valuation in 2019, when its founder Ritesh Agarwal looked to borrow US$700 million to buy back shares.
The potential fundraise might include secondary sales, possibly reducing Oyo’s value to around US$2.5 billion. If the proposed deal happens, the firm’s valuation would be lower than its total disclosed capital raised to date of US$3.2 billion.
3️⃣ Sounding like the Arsene Wenger of the tech world
Ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt told Bloomberg that he had once considered acquiring the short-video app, though he is “not currently looking” at a deal.
This comes amid TikTok’s lawsuit to block the US government’s potential ban. The short-video app argues that the law – which would pressure TikTok’s parent ByteDance to sell the app within a year or risk a ban – restricts free speech. Schmidt also criticized the law, suggesting that regulating TikTok would be more appropriate than an outright ban.
4️⃣ Merge first, then IPO
Indonesia-based brand aggregator Tjufoo and B2B ecommerce firm Sinbad are merging, with the deal set to be finalized by June. Both companies will retain their respective brands, but they will have a new parent company called Horizon Group.
TJ Tham, Tjufoo’s co-founder and CEO, will lead Horizon Group. He said that the group will raise funds and plan an IPO.
5️⃣ It’d be great to just pay for everything on one app no matter where I am
Tencent sees Southeast Asia’s increasingly connected QR payment systems as an opportunity for WeChat Pay, the Chinese tech titan’s mobile payment and e-wallet service.
A Tencent executive told Tech in Asia that joining cross-border QR systems could let WeChat Pay – known in China as Weixin Pay – explore interoperability among digital wallets. This could also help the platform better serve tourists traveling to and from China.
6️⃣ One less Workmate
Mathew Ward, co-founder of blue-collar staffing platform Workmate, is leaving his CEO post, he said in an announcement on his LinkedIn page. The move comes over eight years after he co-founded the startup, and less than two years after it was acquired by Japanese HR conglomerate Persol Asia Pacific.

As founder Masayoshi Son shifts his focus toward semiconductors and AI, SoftBank Group’s Vision Fund has sold off or written down its publicly listed holdings over the past few years, Bloomberg reported.
Its US-listed portfolio, for one, has shrunk by nearly US$29 billion since late 2021. The cause is a mix between SoftBank selling off stakes and a decline in market value for firms like Coupang, DoorDash, and Grab.
Son’s strategy shift comes after the rise of chip company Arm, which was valued at around US$106 billion following its IPO last year. SoftBank’s 90% stake in Arm is now worth more than SoftBank in its entirety.
Now, the staff size at the Vision Fund has decreased, with the remaining staff mainly tasked with finding the best moments to sell assets and/or reverse any losses. While there have been talks in the past about more Vision Funds to follow the first two, it’s unclear whether this plan will materialize.
For now, Son is said to be considering a US$100 billion investment in a chip venture, which would rival Nvidia and provide semiconductors for AI development.
After being in the red in the first half of 2023, the SoftBank Vision Fund did post a gain of US$3.6 billion during the December quarter of 2023. Both Vision Fund 1 and 2 sold investments worth US$19.5 billion in the period, including full exits from 13 portfolio companies.
In another sign of its AI shift, SoftBank has also sold most of its stake in Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba.

TikTok is now attaching labels to AI-made content, the company announced on Thursday. According to a Reuters report, hyper-realistic AI content will be removed if they are not correctly labeled, said Adam Presser, TikTok’s head of operations.
The platform uses a digital watermark system called Content Credentials, which was set up by the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity, a project from a US nonprofit.
For authenticity, both the AI tool’s developer and the content-publishing platform must use the watermark. ChatGPT creator OpenAI already uses this system, with YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook following suit.
Earlier this year, 20 tech companies signed an agreement to partner up and thwart deceptive AI content from disrupting elections worldwide.
ByteDance – TikTok’s parent firm – was recently mandated by a US law to divest the short-video app or potentially face a ban. In response, both TikTok and ByteDance have filed lawsuits to contest the law, asserting that it infringes upon their First Amendment rights.

VC firm Square Peg Capital is looking to raise another US$550 million fund, with fundraising to start some time in the second half of 2024.
This will be the sixth fund the company has raised, following a similarly sized fifth fund.
Tushar Roy, partner at Square Peg, told The Business Times that there was no need to increase the fund size given the market environment.
The company will double down on its investments and activities in markets across Australia, Southeast Asia, and Israel, with plans to expand its team in Singapore, he added.
Leila Lee, Square Peg’s head of distribution, has been promoted to partner and will spearhead the fundraising effort.
“We are trying to be disciplined with our fund sizes. As an emerging markets-centric fund manager, we are aligned to what’s the optimal fund size given the state of maturity we’re seeing,” Roy said.


Square Peg will be continuing its current strategy with the new fund, focusing on the fintech, AI, SaaS, and climate tech sectors. It intends to make three to four investments a year, in line with its tenets as a high-conviction investor, focusing on companies that could give above-average returns.
The VC firm has returned over S$1 billion (US$738.8 million) to investors, taking its distributed to paid-in capital ratio to 4.6x. These returns have come from 16 exits at an average multiple of 6x, giving Square Peg an internal rate of return of 44%. These exits span IPOs to sales on the secondary markets and trade sales.
Square Peg’s track record is above average given that most VC funds have reported few exits in the past two years. As interest rates rose, investors moved money out of higher-risk assets and into fixed-income investments – meaning there has been less money for startup funding and growth companies.

That said, Roy sees a light at the end of the tunnel. “We’re coming out of a low point of the market,” he pointed out. “We have companies being approached for an M&amp;A even as they plan to go public.”
The relatively nascent startup ecosystem in Southeast Asia has made exits even tougher to come by, but Roy sees this situation improving as more startups and corporates look toward M&amp;A as a means of expanding in the region.
One thing Southeast Asia does need to work on, he said, is improving the attractiveness of its public exchanges as listing venues for tech stocks.
While the Indonesia Stock Exchange has played host to a number of tech listings, most debutantes saw their share prices fall post-IPO. Meanwhile, the Singapore Exchange has been struggling to attract large tech listings.
Roy believes the best exchange for a tech company in this part of the world is the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). Square Peg has helped companies list on the ASX before, saying that it is an exchange that understands tech and provides liquidity.
“But I do hope that in the next five to 10 years, there is an emerging exchange that is strong in the region itself,” Roy added. “I think that will do wonders for the industry, but we will need a lot of work to get there.”

OpenAI is ready to launch an advanced search tool that could rival Google and AI search startup Perplexity, with sources telling Reuters that the announcement can come as soon as Monday, May 13.
The schedule puts the announcement on the same week as Google’s annual I/O event on May 15, during which the reigning search giant would introduce more AI-powered products.
OpenAI’s new tool will build on ChatGPT’s capabilities, allowing users to get responses containing web information, including citations from reputable sources. The new product may also provide answers in the form of images, in addition to text, wherever relevant.
Although linked with Microsoft’s Bing for paid users, ChatGPT has struggled to provide accurate and timely information. The new tool may change that, which underscores the increasingly intense competition in the AI space. Google, for one, has launched large language models and chatbots akin to OpenAI’s products.
Meanwhile, Perplexity – founded by an ex-OpenAI researcher – is gaining ground in the AI search interface field, with its response system incorporating citations, images, and text. The platform has 10 million monthly active users.
On the other hand, OpenAI’s user base has fluctuated after successfully introducing ChatGPT in late 2022, which saw 100 million monthly active users at the time.

Nominations are now open for the Emerging Enterprise Awards 2024, which recognize young businesses across Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia, and Malaysia that demonstrate entrepreneurial spirit, innovation, and resilience.
Jointly presented by The Business Times and OCBC Bank, the annual awards are now in their 17th year. They are open to companies with up to 10 years of operations, or up to three years for the Most Promising Startup and Most Promising Sustainability Startup awards, and an annual sales turnover of up to S$20 million (US$14.8 million) or the company’s local currency equivalent.
Applications for the Emerging Enterprise Awards 2024 close on June 7. Interested businesses can find more information and sign up here.
Chen Huifen, editor of The Business Times, noted that the Emerging Enterprise Awards have been a “beacon of possibility” for young enterprises since their launch in 2008.
“In the tapestry of entrepreneurship, small and fast-growing businesses represent the vibrant threads of innovation, passion, and resourcefulness,” said Chen.
This year’s award categories include the Emerging Enterprise Award and the Emerging Enterprise Sustainability Award.
The flagship Emerging Enterprise Award recognizes young businesses that demonstrate an enterprising mindset, while driving consistent, significant, and sustainable growth, and scaling up and expanding overseas. This award will be given out to up to three enterprises.
Additionally, one enterprise that demonstrates a strong startup spirit and has developed a unique and commercially viable idea with long-term potential will stand to walk away with the Most Promising Startup Award.
Separately, the Emerging Enterprise Sustainability Award, which was introduced in 2023, recognises small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that are capitalizing on growth opportunities in the green economy, embedding sustainability in their businesses, and leveraging technology and new solutions to transition to low-carbon businesses and industries.
There are two awards under this category: the Emerging Enterprise Sustainability Award (up to three recipients), and the Most Promising Startup Sustainability Award (one recipient).
Head of emerging business and commercial banking cash at OCBC Christie Chu noted that both award categories received strong participation last year from the “rapidly growing” pool of new and young businesses around the region.
“It shows that the awards remain a compelling platform to showcase and celebrate the achievements of SMEs and resilient entrepreneurs across the region,” said Chu.
This year’s prizes include a two-year interest-free term loan of up to the equivalent of US$149,000 in the winner’s local currency, and a consulting package for growing businesses worth US$22,300.
Past winners of the Emerging Enterprise Awards include gaming-chair maker Secretlab, smart bicycle helmet maker Lumos Labs, and rewards platform ShopBack.
The Emerging Enterprise Awards 2024 are supported by Mastercard, Rajah &amp; Tann Asia, RSM – Singapore, the Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Enterprise Singapore, and Paia Consulting.

847682,2024-05-10T01:00:02,2024-05-13T12:57:28,Why the VC arena is the new playground for Asian sports stars,vc-arena-playground-asian-sports-stars,publish,post,https://www.techinasia.com/vc-arena-playground-asian-sports-stars,"Gone are the days when a star athlete would merely make headlines for throwing lavish parties or purchasing properties. These days, they make newsreels for investing in tech and startups.
Former tennis player Serena Williams was among the earliest personalities to draw attention to athletes in the venture capital space. One of her notable investments is Indonesian coffee chain Kopi Kenangan. Today, she runs Serena Ventures.
Asian athletes are following suit. Last month, Joseph Schooling – a former competitive swimmer and Singapore’s first Olympic gold medalist – announced his entry into the VC space as a founding partner at Swaen Schooling Capital, along with investment banker Cliff Go and serial entrepreneur Ben Ling.
More recently, Keisuke Honda, a former member of Japan’s national football team, threw his hat into the VC ring with X&amp;KSK.

What draws some of these names to the risky world of startups and tech? The hunt for the next big thing, Honda tells Tech in Asia.
Decacorn hunting
Honda’s VC firm X&amp;KSK has team members both in Japan and the US. He is currently raising US$100 million for its debut fund, where he serves as general partner.
He operates the fund with Kohei Yamamoto, who previously worked at Rakuten, and Justin Waldron, a renowned internet entrepreneur.
Honda tells Tech in Asia that he has raised about 30% of the fund’s target. While the fund is sector agnostic, it is mainly considering Japanese startups that have a presence overseas. 
The X&amp;KSK is looking to support 30 Japanese startups, and Honda is eyeing at least one of them in his portfolio to be a “decacorn,” or a company with a valuation of at least US$10 billion. 
Meanwhile, Schooling’s firm – established in 2022 – is focusing on early-stage investments in three areas: impact and sustainability, sports and wellness, and tech.
Swaen Schooling Capital is also open to creating “original businesses in-house” and forming strategic partnerships.
To date, there have been no announcements of investments made by Swaen Schooling Capital. A company spokesperson tells Tech in Asia the firm will “get in touch” when it’s ready to make public announcements.
Banking on fame
VCs and analysts tracking this space believe that former athletes are celebrities in their own right. So by virtue of their fame, they would be able to invest in deals that are otherwise hyper-competitive.
For Williams, she invested in Kopi Kenangan via a fund run by music artist and producer Jay-Z.
Similarly, Honda tells Tech in Asia that he got his first taste of the VC life when he co-founded Dreamers VC with Hollywood actor Will Smith in 2018. The firm invested in projects such as Elon Musk’s Neuralink and The Boring Company.

As an angel investor, Honda had “profitable exits” from firms like ecommerce platform Makuake. He has also invested in the likes of e-scooter firm Luup KK and blockchain company Layerx KK.
Unlike the US, Asia is a much less saturated space for celebrities in the VC space. This means the likes of Honda and Schooling are still considered “premium,” where their celebrity status allows them to command enough attention to get into the latest deals and startups, a Kuala Lumpur-based venture builder tells Tech in Asia.

Moreover, analysts we spoke to believe that athletes-turned-investors can readily tap into a wide business diaspora, especially if they are from Japan, South Korea, or China. Businesses from these countries have large networks abroad, including in Southeast Asia.
On his part, however, Honda remains committed to seeding Japanese firms. He tells Tech in Asia that he is eyeing Southeast Asia, but at the moment he remains non-committal.
Avoiding a bleak post-retirement phase
For some athletes, the VC space helps keep them away from the retirement blues.
A former Malaysian athlete who only wanted to be known as Sue tells Tech in Asia that she is considering angel investing as a means of diversifying her portfolio and as a way to “still be in the game.”
As she got older, Sue realized endorsement deals were hard to come by, and her sponsors were pulling away one by one as they paid more attention to younger athletes.
To mitigate the impact of losing sponsors, she decided to invest in equities and real estate. She also opened a cafe.
“The cafe bombed,” Sue says, citing Kuala Lumpur’s competitive coffee space, and she lost 500,000 ringgit (US$105,000).

Her other source of income is providing personal training services. It was here where a client of hers talked to her about angel investing in the tech and startup space.
Coincidentally, a friend of hers also runs a startup and is planning on raising a round among friends and family. She is considering the offer to invest.
When asked why she waded into a risky investment, Sue says that being an athlete itself was “risky” due to the possibility of injuries and the fact of being left in the lurch post-retirement.
“I trained from when I was five years old and right till 27. That was the only thing I knew, while my friends amassed skills, got a degree, and some got married. Being poor post-career is real,” she shares.
Sue adds that she misses the “high” of competing and believes that while she could no longer step into the sporting arena, she could remain sharp through investing.

Raising funds is a crucial aspect of any business venture, especially for startups that require financial support to grow and succeed. However, this can be a tedious and challenging process, with significant differences in the time it takes to secure investments between funding stages.

One of factors that can affect the time gap between funding stages is the industry or sector in which the startup operates. For instance, healthcare companies require more time and resources to develop products and obtain regulatory approval, which can result in longer periods between funding rounds.
Conversely, software and ecommerce startups can develop and scale their products faster, so they could have shorter lulls between funding rounds.

The state of the broader economy and financial markets can also play a role. In times of economic uncertainty or market volatility, investors may be more cautious and reluctant to invest, leading to longer periods between funding rounds.

The time between funding stages is critical in determining a startup’s runway. If a startup takes too long to raise its next round of funding, it may run out of cash before achieving its milestones. Consequently, this can lead to layoffs, downsizing, or even bankruptcy.

In contrast, startups that secure funds more quickly have a longer runway, allowing them to invest in growth, hire new employees, and develop new products or services. This can result in higher revenue and a more robust customer base, increasing the startup’s chances of survival.

Raising funds is a crucial aspect of any business venture, especially for startups that require financial support to grow and succeed. However, this can be a tedious and challenging process, with significant differences in the time it takes to secure investments between funding stages.

One of factors that can affect the time gap between funding stages is the industry or sector in which the startup operates. For instance, healthcare companies require more time and resources to develop products and obtain regulatory approval, which can result in longer periods between funding rounds.
Conversely, software and ecommerce startups can develop and scale their products faster, so they could have shorter lulls between funding rounds.

The state of the broader economy and financial markets can also play a role. In times of economic uncertainty or market volatility, investors may be more cautious and reluctant to invest, leading to longer periods between funding rounds.

The time between funding stages is critical in determining a startup’s runway. If a startup takes too long to raise its next round of funding, it may run out of cash before achieving its milestones. Consequently, this can lead to layoffs, downsizing, or even bankruptcy.

In contrast, startups that secure funds more quickly have a longer runway, allowing them to invest in growth, hire new employees, and develop new products or services. This can result in higher revenue and a more robust customer base, increasing the startup’s chances of survival.

The founders of aCommerce Group are considering divesting shares in the Thailand-based firm via a deal that would value it at between US$200 million and US$300 million, sources with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg.
Shareholders, including co-founder and CEO Paul Srivorakul, have contacted potential buyers and are reportedly working with a finance consultant for the possible sale.
In a statement to Tech in Asia, Srivorakul said aCommerce does not comment on capital raising or exit initiatives.
However, he added that the company had reached net income profitability in the fourth quarter of 2023, following three consecutive quarters of EBITDA breakeven.
“In 2023, we experienced a significant 18.6% increase in our end-to-end merchandising value, greatly outpacing the sector’s average,” Sriborakul said. He also noted that aCommerce’s expansion into live commerce and investments into AI “position [it] well for continued growth.”
Established in 2013, aCommerce helps businesses manage, market, and develop their online stores. It also provides consultation and traning as well as warehousing and fulfillment services.
The company operates in Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines. Some of its customers include major brands like L’Oreal, Adidas, Unilever, and Nescafe.
NTT Docomo Ventures, KKR-backed Emerald Media, and MDI Ventures are among aCommerce’s current investors.
Notably, the firm once considered an initial public offering but decided against it. At that time, it was reportedly seeking to sell 1.6 billion shares, representing approximately 35% of its share capital. It was aiming to raise between US$250 million and US$300 million.
However, aCommerce laid off some of its employees in June 2023, citing a shifting business landscape as one of the factors behind the move.

Venturi Partners has bought 5.12% of K12 Techno Services shares for US$27 million from Navneet Learning, a subsidiary of educational and children’s book publishing firm Navneet.
Operating in India’s private education domain, K12 Techno Services provides a integrated curriculum and multimedia teaching aids to over 800 private schools, reaching over 300,000 students across the country. Additionally, it offers assessment and administrative solutions for teachers, school management teams, and marketing teams.
The company said that over the past five years, its revenue has grown at a compound annual growth rate of around 40%.
Venturi Partners made the investment through its maiden US$180 million consumer-focused fund.
After finalizing the fund in April 2022, Venturi Partners aimed to invest in growth-stage startups between series B and series D, with check sizes ranging from US$10 million to US$40 million.
Venturi will join existing shareholders such as Peak XV Partners, Kedaara Capital, Sofina Ventures, and Navneet Learning to aid K12 Techno Services’ management.
Peak XV Partners partially exited from K12 Techno Services in September 2023, when the edtech firm secured an undisclosed investment from Kedaara Capital. The Venturi Partners deal, meanwhile, provided a partial exit to Navneet Learning.
K12 Techno Services will now be part of Venturi Partners’ investment portfolio in India and Southeast Asia, which includes Livspace, Country Delight, Believe, Pickup Coffee, and Dali.

ByteDance’s founder Zhang Yiming, while still a Chinese citizen, has chosen Singapore as his current residence, Fortune reported.
Zhang’s current residence was revealed in TikTok’s lawsuit against the US legislation that requires ByteDance to divest itself of TikTok.
In 2022, The Information also reported that Zhang had been spending most of his time in Singapore, with people close to him claiming at the time that his move may have stemmed from tighter tech regulations in China.
Legal documents of the lawsuit show Zhang owns 21% of the company – worth around US$40 billion when taking into account ByteDance’s US$268 billion valuation as of December 2023. The remaining 79% of ByteDance is held by global investors and employees.
Some other top execs, such as ByteDance co-founder Liang Rubo and TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, also reside in Singapore.
Notably, TikTok and its parent firm ByteDance are pursuing legal action to combat a US law that mandates ByteDance to sell the short-video app.
ByteDance was given until January 19, 2025 to sell TikTok, failing which the app will be blocked nationally. But according to the lawsuit, selling off TikTok is not conceivable from a practical or legal standpoint.
In the past, ByteDance declared that should it lose the battle to have the app banned in the US, it would decide to sell rather than close its US operations.

Singaporean retailer Motherswork has opened an offline store in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. This marks the company’s first leap into click-and-collect shopping, allowing customers to choose between home delivery and pick-up for online purchases.
Christina de los Reyes, country manager of Motherswork in Vietnam, said there is a rising demand for quality family products in the country. “This market presents a potential annual revenue of US$7 billion and a growth rate of 30% to 40%,” she added.
Motherswork – which was acquired by theAsianparent owner The Parentinc earlier this year – offers toys, strollers, books, and nursery products. It sells these products through an online platform as well as physical shops.
Aside from its newly opened branch in Vietnam, Motherswork has 10 other offline shops: two in Singapore and eight in China. These stores sell maternity and babycare items from over 300 brands, including the likes of Avent, Joolz, and Stokke.
The Singaporean retailer also has a proprietary line of baby beddings and decor that it offers under the Little Rei brand.
With its entry to Vietnam, Motherswork will have to deal with the country’s rapidly aging population and low birth rate. Its expansion also puts it in direct competition with Con Cung, which currently has over 700 offline stores across the country.

Hello reader,
Sticking to your guns is hard at the best of times, but it must be even harder when you’re in a leadership position at a loss-making company.
Today’s featured story looks at Singaporean biotech firm Mirxes, which has released some mixed financial results ahead of a looming IPO in Hong Kong.
Despite seeing its losses swell to more than US$70 million, the company recently took out loans worth a total of over US$27 million in a bid to speed its path to going public.
From the outside, that may not add up, but those inside the company are likely confident that they have the right approach. Time will tell, but regardless, conviction like that is worth taking notice of.
Today we look at:


Mirxes sees revenue and losses increase as IPO approaches 
TikTok and ByteDance launch lawsuit to keep app in US

Premium summary
Mixed bag for Mirxes

Image credit: Timmy Loen

With Mirxes’ anticipated Hong Kong IPO coming up within the next six months, the Singaporean biotech firm has reported some mixed financial results.
While the company’s revenue grew 36.2% year on year to US$24.2 million in 2023, its total losses also surged 21.8% to US$70.4 million.


Costs rising: Per its filing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the increase in losses was mainly due to higher spending on research and development, which grew 22.3% year on year to US$22.6 million. The company’s general and administrative expenses also increased by 20% over the same period.

All systems go for IPO: Mirxes, which develops test kits for the early detection of cancer and other diseases, announced its plans to list in Hong Kong last July. Its latest prospectus shows that it took out a loan for US$25 million in April 2024 and received loans worth a total of over US$2.7 million from co-founder and CEO Zhou Lihan the month before. The firm told Tech in Asia that it took the short-term loans out in order to speed up its journey to going public.

Revenue mix: About 72% of the company’s revenue is generated from its early detection and precision multi-omics segment, which consists of the GastroClear and LungClear products. GastroClear, which is used to detect gastric cancer early, is Mirxes’ core product.

News spotlight
TikTok fights back

Image credit: Timmy Loen

TikTok is fighting tooth and nail to stave off a ban in the US, and it’s taking that fight to the courts.
The short-video app and its parent firm ByteDance are pursuing legal action in the country to stop a law that would ban or force a sale of TikTok, Reuters reported.


Locking legal horns: The law, which has been ratified by US President Joe Biden, gives ByteDance until January 19 next year to sell TikTok – failure to do so will result in a nationwide ban for the app. TikTok and ByteDance believe the law is in contradiction of the First Amendment free speech rights of the US Constitution.

Nuts and bolts: The lawsuit claims that it would be practically and legally unfeasible for ByteDance to sell TikTok. It also says that the Chinese government has “made clear” that it would not allow ByteDance to divest its recommendation engine, which drives its success in the US.

Ownership by the numbers: ByteDance also argues that 58% of its ownership is held by global investors like BlackRock, General Atlantic, and Susquehanna International Group. The company’s Chinese founder holds just 21%, with the rest owned by employees, including 7,000 Americans.

Thai food delivery firm Line Man Wongnai is planning to launch its IPO in 2025 on either a Thai or US exchange, TechCrunch reported, citing CEO and co-founder Yod Chinsupakul.
A dual listing in both countries may also be a possibility, the executive added.
Valued at over US$1 billion, the firm has raised over US$372 million from investors such as Z Holdings, BRV Asia, and Singapore’s GIC.
Starting as a restaurant review site in 2010, Wongnai merged with food delivery firm Line Man in 2020. The merger gave Line Man Wongnai access to Line, Thailand’s leading messaging app with over 50 million users.
Now Line Man Wongnai provides services like food delivery, restaurant reviews, and ride-hailing. It also acquired Rabbit Line Pay, a payment platform, and point-of-sale startup FoodStory in 2023.
Chinsupakul said the company plans to expand the services of its two acquired companies and invest in Line Man Wongnai’s tech team, with a focus on data and AI.
For its overall business, Line Man Wongnai said it will currently focus on the Thai market. It may also consider expansion into other Southeast Asian countries after its IPO.
GrabFood is currently the most popular food delivery player in Thailand, according to data from Statista, but Line Man Wongnai is not far behind.
However, there is still room to grow for food delivery firms in the country. According to Statista data, only 27.14% of Thai people order food online, and just 17.34% use online grocery delivery services.

Photo credit: Rize

Rize, a Singapore-based agritech startup, has secured US$14 million in a series A funding round co-led by Breakthrough Energy Ventures, GenZero, Temasek, and Wavemaker Impact.
The company plans to use the funds to boost its presence in other markets like Indonesia and Vietnam. It also aims to increase its team of agronomy experts to over 100.
Rize’s platform gathers key agricultural information needed for sustainable farming. By consolidating data on farm performance and crop yields, the company helps rice farmers adapt to climate change, improve their crops, and reduce expenses and water consumption.
The agritech firm focuses on alternate wetting and drying (AWD) as well as direct seeding rice (DSR) to save water and reduce methane emissions without compromising the harvest. AWD is a water-saving technique in rice farming that alternates between flooding and drying the field, while DSR is a method of directly sowing rice seeds into the field, eliminating the need for transplanting seedlings.
According to data from the World Bank, rice farming is currently responsible for 10% of global methane emissions and as much as 33% of Southeast Asia’s methane emissions. Meanwhile, data from the International Rice Research Institute shows that the rice industry accounts for over a third of the global irrigation water usage.
Another Singapore-based firm in this space is DayaTani, which secured US$2.3 million in new funding in January this year. The company mainly focuses on Indonesia, helping local farmers enhance yields.

I’vre CEO Christian Kwok / Image credit: Tech in Asia

High-end fragrance service I’vre has shuttered its perfume subscription business. This comes amid a police inquiry into complaints of wrong charges and uncompleted orders.
I’vre co-founder Christian Kwok told The Straits Times that the company has fulfilled all remaining orders and refunds. However, some customers have told the publication that they are still waiting on repayments.
In December 2023, the company started being investigated by the police due to customer complaints about unfulfilled orders and refunds. At the time, I’vre had stopped taking new orders to focus on honoring existing ones, according to Kwok.
Questioned about these incidents, the co-founder said that internal issues like staff shortages made “the entire process” for this “messy.”
Despite this, the company was selling roughly 100 luxury perfume bottles at US$55.4 each in March 2024, The Straits Times noted, citing an email from I’vre to one of its customers.
Last year, Tech in Asia also reported on the issue. At the time, Kwok acknowledged that some customers were overcharged due to human error.
Tech in Asia also reported that several ex-employees were not paid salaries for October and November 2023. Kwok, however, said that I’vre would pay out the salaries it owes.
Amid issues with investors, the exec also said in his interaction with Tech in Asia that I’vre was acquired by an unnamed entity. However, a search on Singapore’s business registry at the time found no information on the acquirer.

Elon Musk’s xAI is set to raise new capital as soon as this week in a round that would push its valuation to around US$18 billion, Bloomberg reported, citing sources.
In April, it was reported that Musk’s AI venture was looking to raise up to US$6 billion in the round, with Sequoia Capital among the investors.
Talks are still ongoing and details such as the timing and the company’s valuation are still up in the air, the people said.
With its chatbot named Grok, xAI is seeking its place against rivals like OpenAI in the competitive AI chatbot market.
Recently, Musk changed Grok to an open-source model. The move came as he accused OpenAI of not being open despite the company’s name as well as its initial promise to make its tech publicly accessible.
Musk has highlighted that the news summaries would rely on posts from X users, with the feature being accessible only to paid X Premium subscribers.
Notably, X has used Grok to give users a summary of news events. Musk mentioned that these summaries will be updated with new information as it becomes available. However, recent reports have surfaced regarding Grok spreading fake news on X.

In April, Singapore-based Mo Batteries bowed out of the EV race in the city-state, just a year into a trial of its battery-swapping solution. The company cited high costs and the complexity of commercializing its solution in the city-state for the move.
With this exit, only one operator remains in the pilot: Taiwan-headquartered Gogoro.

Mo Batteries’ withdrawal raises questions about whether swappable batteries are still viable in Singapore in light of other EV charging solutions, which are springing up across the country.
Lower costs, higher adoption
EVs with swappable batteries are but one option for drivers in Singapore looking to make the switch from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. Others have fixed batteries that require charging.
As batteries can account for between 30% to 40% of an EV’s price tag, taking out this component can slash the upfront costs of an EV.
In China, consumers can purchase Nio’s ET5 – an electric sedan – for 298,000 yuan (US$41,300) if it comes with a battery and pay 228,000 yuan (US$31,600) for one without. Those opting for the latter pay less upfront, but they fork out a monthly fee of at least 980 yuan (US$136) for a battery lease.
Rather than recharging batteries when they run low, drivers of EVs with swappable batteries either pay a fee each time they require a new battery or take a monthly subscription based on their level of use.
In a typical set-up, EVs make stops at battery-swapping stations – a garage-like structure – scattered around a city. At some of these stations, drivers can manually do the swap, while in others, robot arms switch out spent batteries for fully charged ones.

The process is commonplace in China, where players such as Nio operate more than 3,500 battery-swapping stations. It also takes around five minutes, putting it on par with a fuel stop at a petrol station.
In contrast, using EV chargers can take up to eight hours at a standard charging point in Singapore.
Swapping operators, however, bear the cost of the batteries, which is expensive. Building out a network, which involves swapping stations and a surplus of batteries, is also highly capital intensive.
Mo Batteries, which works with fleet operators looking to make the transition into EVs, sought to design an efficient solution that reduces the amount of charging infrastructure – such as battery inventory – a fleet operator needs.
The company’s software and proprietary algorithms predict driving behavior based on a person’s usage patterns, enabling fleet operators to meet charging demand with the least number of batteries – in turn, lowering their operating costs.
Not a fit
Speaking to Tech in Asia, Mo Batteries co-founder Tom Strietberg says the trial had gone “very well” and that the firm had achieved its goals of understanding the demand for e-motorbikes and costs of operating charging infrastructure in Singapore.
The company had chosen Singapore as a testbed because of its relatively high spending power and the population’s general willingness to adopt EVs. The high cost of petrol in the country was also a factor, as it raises the cost of owning an ICE vehicle.

But what threw a spanner in the works, Strietberg says, was a slew of regulations governing safety standards around EV charging in Singapore that were released by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) in December 2023.
Under the LTA rules, all charger systems have to comply with a national standard, and all EV charger models to be type-approved and certified by the agency. This would have required making modifications and seeking approval for existing equipment such as battery chargers and docking stations as off-the-shelf equipment couldn’t be used, entailing additional cost for Mo Batteries.
Operators of charging equipment and EVs also had to obtain the necessary licenses, while a “record-keeping requirement” added “another layer of complexity,” Strietberg explains.
While Singapore’s regulations are “very high on safety” and “robust,” he says that when added to the costs of running the business, this “didn’t fit together” with Mo Batteries’ business model.
Mo Batteries, which is now looking to offer its fleet management software in markets like Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam, isn’t the first battery-swapping player in Singapore that had to take its solution abroad.
Singapore-headquartered Oyika, which develops battery charging and swapping infrastructure for EVs, also worked with local e-motorbike brands at one point. It has since expanded to Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Cambodia, but it doesn’t appear to be offering its solution in Singapore at the moment. The company could not be reached for comment.
The Mo model
Unlike Gogoro, which is trialing its battery swapping solution on its own SmartScooters in Singapore, Mo Batteries does not make EVs or batteries.
“Our business model was always not to manufacture any equipment,” Streitberg explains. “The margins available for manufactured vehicles are relatively thin, and the technology and capital investment required to build your own batteries is enormous.”
Instead, Mo Batteries’ fleet management software is designed to work with “any e-motorbike and battery,” he says. Fleet operators that work with the company are free to adopt suitable e-bike models on the market.
However, focusing on software instead of hardware likely posed challenges for Mo Batteries, according to one industry observer.
Without a standard set of vehicles and batteries, the firm could not ensure that riders’ experiences were uniform across trials, notes Akshay Prasad, senior engagement manager at management consultancy Arthur D. Little in Southeast Asia.
Aspects of product performance such as acceleration and thrust can vary widely depending on the vehicle mix, but by prioritizing software, Mo Batteries “didn’t pay so much attention” to these areas, Prasad says.
“From a strategy perspective, I think they got that wrong,” he adds.
During the trial, Mo Batteries did not operate battery-swapping stations where riders returned empty batteries. Instead, the batteries were returned to a central location to be charged.
The firm’s co-founder Streitberg pointed out how this approach is cheaper than building a network of charging stations.
If you ask me whether [battery] swapping as a concept will work in Singapore, I would say no, it will not.
Mo Batteries’ eventual plan, he shares, would have been a “multimodal” approach that combines providing centralized charging with a battery delivery service to workplaces and other locations, and running several battery-swapping stations.
But Prasad contends that centralized charging and delivery would have entailed added delivery costs while preventing Mo Batteries from enjoying cost savings that come with operating charging stations.
Operators that run charging cabinets, he explains, get a price arbitrage when batteries are programmed to charge in the night or at off-peak periods – times when utility firms charge less for power consumption. “I think that is something which [Mo Batteries] was not able to capitalize,” Prasad says.
Could the trial have gone differently had Mo Batteries worked with other partners? Streightberg stresses that its trials with postal carrier Singapore Post and security solutions provider Certis, the “two largest e-motorbike fleet operators in Singapore,” were “all successful.”
Swap or no swap?
By many accounts, Singapore is ready for an EV transition. Its high gross domestic product per capita, commitment to expand public charging infrastructure, and subsidies on the purchase of EVs make it among the most market-ready places in the world, following Norway and China.

But while some observers are confident of Singapore’s electrification targets, they do not see battery swapping as the solution.
“If you ask me whether [battery] swapping as a concept will work in Singapore, I would say no, it will not,” says Prasad of Arthur D. Little.
“Whenever you’re talking about electrification targets of any country, you need to look at the vehicle or mix and decide whether swapping or charging makes sense,” he adds.
You need scale, which the Singapore market does not offer you.
A feasibility study by Arthur D. Little in 2023 found battery swapping to be the most viable for two-wheeled and three-wheeled vehicles, and particularly when used by businesses, because of their higher average daily distance traveled rates.
B2B fleet operators like ride-hailing or food delivery companies, which depend heavily on two-wheelers, are strongly motivated to cut costs. The study also found that battery swapping can save close to 26% compared to ICE vehicles or 19% compared to EVs with fixed batteries.
Battery swapping also decreases downtime for drivers compared to a charging alternative. In turn, this can be more productively spent on work, improving a company’s top line.
Singapore, however, has a small population of two-wheeled vehicles to begin with. In 2023, there were just over 140,000 motorcycles and scooters on the roads – less than 15% of the overall vehicle population.
“You need scale, which the Singapore market does not offer you,” Prasad stresses.
Fully electric by 2040?
That’s not to say battery swapping is entirely out of the question in Singapore.
A Gogoro spokesperson tells Tech in Asia that its pilot in the country is “going well.” Gogoro has also received “overwhelming positive feedback” from its partners, automotive group Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage and food delivery platform Foodpanda plus its riders.

The spokesperson adds that Gogoro is in the final stages of its application process with the LTA on the nationwide charging standard, before moving towards a commercial deployment with existing partners. Gogoro’s test period is expected to conclude in September 2024.
One firm’s setback in battery swapping is unlikely to derail Singapore’s 2040 targets, which include plans to build 60,000 charging points with over a third underway.
Singapore’s charging infrastructure is far from where it needs to be, but the LTA has ramped up efforts to expand it and increasing that coverage is “a function of time,” Prasad says.
As things stand, potential battery-swapping players could be deterred by the apparent policy focus towards EV charging, which could result in worries over “whether the government will promote [their] services or not,” Prasad points out.
“I think that deters a lot of the major swapping players from entering the market,” he notes.
With “clear sustainability goals for four-wheel vehicles” laid out in Singapore’s Green Plan 2030, Gogoro says it looks forward to similar targets being rolled out for two-wheeled vehicles as well.
Despite the setback, Mo Batteries’ Streitberg agrees that EV adoption is just a matter of time as EV costs go down, existing ICE vehicles fully depreciate, and people “get used to seeing charging points around.”
When this happens, “I think the change will be very rapid,” he says.
Currency converted from Singapore dollars and Chinese yuan to US dollars: US$1 = S$1.36; US$1 = 7.23 yuan.

Singapore needs to be realistic about the global trends affecting the city-state’s equities market and the actions that can be taken to change them, said Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong on Wednesday.
Wong, who is also the country’s finance minister, said that the conditions for Singapore’s stock market to attract companies to list remain challenging.
But he also noted that stock exchanges in developed markets, such as the United Kingdom and Hong Kong, suffer from the same problem.
Global proceeds from IPOs continue to decline, falling 33% in 2023. In Asia Pacific, they fell even more at 44%, said Wong.
“Strong-growth companies backed by private equity and venture capital have the option to remain private for longer in the high-for-longer interest rate environment. Those that choose to go public tend to gravitate to the US due to its deep and liquid capital market and investor base,” he added.
Wong was responding to a parliamentary question by Member of Parliament for Sengkang GRC Louis Chua, on whether the existing measures to increase the attractiveness of Singapore’s stock market have been effective. Chua also asked whether the government would encourage private-owned companies in which it holds equity to list on the Singapore Exchange (SGX).
The Financial Times recently reported that the country’s government agencies are studying proposals by an investor association – which includes state funds such as GIC and Temasek – to shake up its struggling stock market.
Wong, who will take over as Singapore’s prime minister next Wednesday, noted that the government and SGX have implemented several initiatives to shore up listings. These include a range of funds to support high-growth enterprises, as well as grant schemes to defray listing costs and increase research coverage of Singapore-listed stocks.
SGX has also tried to broaden market access by working with Thailand’s stock exchange on depository receipt listings. A depository receipt represents shares in a foreign company traded on a local stock exchange, and it gives investors the opportunity to hold shares in the equity of foreign countries.
While the government will continue to encourage companies incubated in Singapore to list on the SGX, Wong noted that GIC and Temasek “operate on a commercial basis and have a mandate to deliver good long-term returns for the benefit of Singapore and Singaporeans.”
“They regularly engage their portfolio companies on options to create shareholder value, which may include a listing in Singapore,” he said. “However, the final listing decisions will have to be made by the companies themselves, based on their commercial objectives and growth plans.”

Tencent sees Southeast Asia’s increasingly connected QR payment systems as an opportunity for WeChat Pay, the Chinese tech titan’s mobile payment and e-wallet service.
Speaking to Tech in Asia on the sidelines of this year’s Money 20/20 conference, a Tencent executive said that joining cross-border QR systems could let WeChat Pay – known in China as Weixin Pay – explore interoperability among digital wallets. This could also help the platform better serve tourists traveling to and from China.
“As the infrastructure is being unified, it would be easier for us to eventually help the economy grow on both sides,” said Wenhui Yang, deputy managing director of business development at Tenpay Global, Tencent’s cross-border payments unit.
In 2022, Tenpay Global launched a campaign that connected more than 10,000 merchants at Singapore hawker centers, using SGQR with Weixin Pay. Such initiatives could be replicated across Southeast Asia, according to Yang.
If implemented, a region-wide integration would enable Chinese users to scan Southeast Asia’s national QR codes, while also linking WeChat Pay and other digital wallets in the region. Japan is also exploring a similar move.
Yang acknowledges that Tenpay Global needs to bolster its branding efforts overseas, as China – where WeChat Pay has about 935 million active users – remains the primary focus of its mother company, Tencent.
In cross-border payments, Tenpay Global is falling behind its competitor Alipay+ because of WeChat’s limited use cases abroad, according to an analysis by fintech consulting firm Kapronasia.
In recent months, Alipay+ has expanded aggressively in Southeast Asia and other overseas markets.

Workmate co-founder and CEO Mathew Ward / Photo credit: Workmate

Mathew Ward, co-founder of blue-collar staffing platform Workmate, is leaving his CEO post, he said in an announcement on his LinkedIn page. The move comes over eight years after he co-founded the startup, and less than two years after it was acquired by Japanese HR conglomerate Persol Asia Pacific.
Ward tells Tech in Asia that he “will be stepping away entirely and won’t have a role with the business moving forward.” After Ward’s departure, managing director Andrew Senduk will lead the business side, while head of product Andriano Winatra will lead tech and product.
According to Ward, both Senduk and Winatra will report to Takayuki Yamazaki, CEO of Persol Asia Pacific.
“The problem we have worked to solve is an incredibly hard one – to change the way the blue-collar labor market operates in Southeast Asia,” Ward wrote in his post. “We have not achieved the mission yet, but we have come a long way – employing over 100,000 workers and paying out close to US$100 million in wages to workers since we started.”
Headquartered in Singapore, Workmate started offering its staffing services in Indonesia and Thailand in 2016. Using its proprietary AI-powered algorithm, the platform matches pre-screened workers to companies.
The startup began as a job-matching platform but eventually pivoted into offering staffing services. Workmate’s website lists the likes of Foodpanda, eFishery, Fresh Factory, and Carousell as clients.
Workmate has raised almost US$20 million in disclosed funding from investors like Wavemaker Partners and Gobi Partners. Its acquisition – reportedly for an eight-figure US dollar sum – came amid the tech winter in October 2022.
In his LinkedIn post, Ward shared the company almost “died” three times, having less than two weeks’ worth of cash on two separate occasions.

While AI tools have begun proliferating globally, especially after the arrival of ChatGPT, Jason Sosa found that many AI tools available today are made by engineers for other engineers – not regular employees. This means many businesses, especially those without large war chests to develop in-house AI teams, remain on wait-and-see mode with regards to AI.
That’s the solution that Singapore-based Azara AI, where Sosa is CEO and co-founder, aims to provide. While no-code AI platforms are nothing new, Azara AI’s interface works much like a chatbot: Give the platform a prompt and it will generate the solution for you.
The startup, which has started generating revenue, has also raised US$1 million over the past year. Investors include Singapore-based VC firm Iterative VC, 500 Startups founder Dave McClure, Untapped Capital’s Yohei Nakajima, and unidentified angel investors from Meta and Airbnb.
According to Azara AI’s website, the platform has “AI agents” that are specialized on a number of company needs such as customer service, operations, and human resources. The company claims that when given the right prompts, these agents can be integrated into a business’ existing workflow, automate tasks, and process data.
“Azara generates workflow, writing the code behind the scenes and intelligently routes to all the plugins your business already uses,” Sosa says in a video posted on his LinkedIn page. The company operates on a subscription model, though the website does not disclose pricing.
Sosa co-founded Azara in 2023 with Steve Messina, an IBM alum, and Shahid Chishty, who previously served as chief investment officer in California-based VC firm Portola Valley Partners.

Indonesia-based brand aggregator Tjufoo and B2B ecommerce firm Sinbad are merging, with the deal set to be finalized by June. Both companies will retain their respective brands, but they will have a new parent company called Horizon Group.
TJ Tham, Tjufoo’s co-founder and CEO, will lead Horizon Group. He said that the group will raise funds and plan an IPO.
With the merger, Sinbad aims to become a standalone brand, as opposed to just a distributor of other brands. Meanwhile, Tjufoo will primarily handle the group’s distribution aspects.
Founded in 2022, Tjufoo calls itself a “house of brands” offering distribution services, research and analytics, and an optimized supply chain infrastructure for small businesses in Indonesia. Tham founded the company after leaving Grab, where he served as CEO for GrabWheels, among other roles.
Tjufoo first raised an undisclosed amount of seed funding in 2022 in a round led by TNB Aura. It then extended that round with a US$2.1 million fundraise in January 2024 from Binus Investama and other investors.
Meanwhile, Sinbad’s platform allows retailers to order items, primarily fast-moving consumer goods, directly to manufacturers. The company raised US$5.5 million in series A funding in 2022, according to Tracxn data, and counts the likes of Centauri Fund and KB Financial Group as investors.
While several ecommerce roll-up players have struggled in recent times, Tjufoo says that it is profitable. Other peers have also thrived: Singapore-headquartered Una Brands, for instance, hit EBITDA profitability earlier this year.

Hello reader,
Climate change is a real and scary problem. Here in Singapore, the days have been blistering hot recently. I don’t remember the weather being this scorching 10 years ago, and I worry about what the world will be like for future generations. Is it going to be some Mad Max-esque wasteland?
That’s why climate tech startups are so important. While we have the science to create some truly transformative solutions, these companies still need money to turn their visions a reality. However, the public sector alone can’t support this growing industry, and this is where the private sector needs to step into the picture.
Today we look at:

What needs to be done to address the climate tech funding gap

The climate tech funding gap

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Climate tech is important, but the sector struggles to get the funding it needs. There’s a private funding gap of approximately US$2 trillion in the industry, according to global consulting firm Deloitte. How can we fix this?


Demystify: Climate tech solutions often involve complex technologies, and startups in the space can find it difficult to explain the mechanics underpinning their solutions. By being transparent and open about the science and processes behind what they do, founders can more easily persuade investors that their ideas are feasible. 

De-risk: Climate tech can seem like a high-risk space, which makes investors wary. Startups can mitigate this in a number of ways, such as developing resilient and stable supply chains, reducing dependence on partners through vertical integration, and diversifying their pool of clients. 

Design: Climate tech firms take a longer time to break even and scale compared to other tech segments. The traditional 10-year VC fund model may not be the best choice, and investors need to get creative and design fund mechanics to account for climate tech’s unique challenges.

Carsome, a Malaysia-headquartered used-car marketplace, hit quarterly positive EBITDA for the first time in Q1 2024, the company said in a statement. It did not disclose hard numbers, but it partly attributed the development to a “significant” improvement in gross profit per unit, which rose 48% year on year.
“While we are on track to achieve the group’s first full-year profitability this year, we are also continuing our long-term vision of driving profitable growth and extending our leadership in the region and the industry,” co-founder and CEO Eric Cheng said, adding that the untapped potential in Carsome’s market is “immense.”
The firm also said it has sold more than 500,000 cars since its 2015 founding, with 150,000 of them sold last year. Meanwhile, revenues from Carsome Capital surged by over 80% in 2023, marking the second year in a row of net profits for Carsome’s financing and insurance arm.
The used-car marketplace, which operates in three other Southeast Asian markets aside from its native Malaysia, is reportedly eyeing a public listing. In June 2023, it raised an undisclosed amount of funding, which appears to be part of its IPO preparations.
The company has also reshuffled its top management, appointing a new group CFO as well as a COO over the past year. It has not publicly announced when and where it will go public.

Photo credit: Tech in Asia Indonesia

Oyo is in discussions to raise fresh funds at a valuation of US$3 billion or less, TechCrunch reported, citing people briefed on the situation. The amount is a far cry from the India-based hospitality firm’s US$10 billion valuation in 2019, when its founder Ritesh Agarwal looked to borrow US$700 million to buy back shares.
The potential fundraise might include secondary sales, possibly reducing Oyo’s value to around US$2.5 billion. If the proposed deal happens, the firm’s valuation would be lower than its total disclosed capital raised to date of US$3.2 billion.
However, these potential terms are still under discussion and nothing is confirmed.
Oyo has rejected any claims of a valuation dip, saying no transactions or valuation talks have been finalized.
Back in 2022, SoftBank – one of the Indian firm’s major investors – had also reduced its valuation of the company to US$2.7 billion.
In January this year, Malaysian sovereign fund Khazanah Nasional was reported to be in talks to lead a US$400 million round in Oyo. However, it’s unclear where those talks currently stand, and whether they are distinct to the one TechCrunch reported.
Oyo had announced plans for an IPO last November, but the listing was eventually delayed. That was the second time it had done so – the company had also planned to go public in 2021, when it would have raised roughly US$1.2 billion at a US$12 billion valuation.

The decision-makers at Indonesia-based fintech firm Akulaku
GXBank’s foray into microinsurance
The players in Singapore’s crowded fintech space


Welcome to The Top Up! Delivered every fortnight via email and through the Tech in Asia website, this free newsletter breaks down the biggest stories and trends in fintech. Get it in your email inbox by registering here.
Hi there,
I’m probably in the minority for never having tapped on a buy now, pay later (BNPL) service, although I did choose to pay in installments for my iPhone and iPad.
Despite the headwinds in recent years, it is possible to run a profitable BNPL business – Atome Financial’s operating income rose to US$170 million in 2023.
While its largest user base is in Indonesia, the company expressed excitement about Malaysia and the Philippines, where it said there is “much less competition.”
One of Atome’s biggest competitors in Indonesia is Ant Group-backed Akulaku, though it has faced its fair share of challenges.
In this week’s Big Story, my colleague Budi maps out the decision-makers at Akulaku and notes that its BNPL offerings were found by Indonesia’s financial services authority (OJK) to have violated supervisory obligations.
The fintech unicorn, which was seeking a US listing in 2022 via a SPAC merger that would value the combined entity at US$2 billion, was prohibited from offering BNPL services from October 2023. But these restrictions were lifted in March this year.
Meanwhile, the share price of Bank Neo Commerce (BNC) – Akulaku’s affiliated digital bank, in which it owns a 27% stake – is down 90% from its peak in late 2021.
The responsibility of turning things around now falls on Eri Budiono, who was appointed CEO of BNC last week.
On the topic of digital banks, in this week’s Hot Take, we take a closer look at the Malaysia-based digibank GXBank – a subsidiary of GXS Bank in Singapore – which announced a partnership with Zurich Malaysia. 
Together, both firms aim to provide microinsurance products to underserved Malaysians. Why launch a microinsurane product in Malaysia? Read on to find out.

In April, the fintech firm appointed a new CEO for Bank Neo Commerce, its digital bank, whose share price has fallen around 90% since its 2021 peak.

THE HOT TAKE
What will it take for GXBank and Zurich Malaysia’s partnership to succeed?

GXBank’s launch in Malaysia / Photo credit: GXBank

Here’s what happened:

GXBank, the Malaysia-based subsidiary of GXS Bank, announced a 10-year exclusive bancassurance partnership with Zurich Malaysia.
Their first product, which aims to protect individuals from unauthorized transactions resulting from cybercrime, is slated to be launched in the third quarter of this year.
Both firms will co-create microprotection products for underserved Malaysians.

Here’s our take:
Launched in November 2023, GXBank is younger than GXS Bank, its Singapore parent born as a joint venture between Grab and Singtel. Yet, the Malaysian digibank is also the first of the two to launch an insurance product.
In fact, GXBank has gone a step further by announcing a decade-long exclusive partnership with the Malaysian arm of Swiss giant Zurich Insurance Group.
Protecting individuals from unauthorized transactions resulting from cybercrime, as well as those initiated by electronic scam messages, does seem to make sense. According to recent reports, online fraud cases in Malaysia doubled between 2019 and 2023, and losses exceeded RM1.3 billion (US$270 million) last year.
However, neither GXBank nor Zurich Malaysia has provided any further details, such as the pricing, coverage, and duration ahead of the product’s launch.
Similarly, while both parties said they would jointly develop digital insurance products that are “simple, user-friendly, and affordable,” they were mum on what types of insurance products these would be.
Microinsurance products are available in bite-sized portions and generally don’t require medical tests and other documentation. They are often pitched as a more affordable form of insurance coverage, and the sum insured is also lower than in traditional policies.
These products generally cover needs that traditional insurers have overlooked. For example, last year, Singapore insurtech firm Igloo launched several insurance plans, one of which protects customers against food poisoning while another provides coverage for mobile phones.
As microinsurance products are low-margin, success will come to companies that sell a large number of such policies.
For example, Igloo has facilitated over 500 million policies since its inception, but it’s still not profitable, although it is aiming to go in the black this year.
The question GXBank faces is whether the underserved segment of Malaysia’s nearly 35 million population is large enough to support the volumes needed to build a sustainable business.
Apart from affordability, the other factor contributing to the number of uninsured people is a lack of understanding of the need for insurance protection.
Junior Cho, country CEO and head of Zurich Malaysia, said the long-term nature of the partnership will enable the insurer to be “flexible and agile in how [it] can co-create relevant affordable insurance products.” He didn’t elaborate on how the need to enhance awareness is linked to the long-term nature of the partnership, or how flexibility helps.
Still, despite these issues, GXBank is at the tip of the spear when it comes to how Grab’s family of digital banks in the region can integrate insurance in their suite of products. At some point, lessons from this initiative may come in useful when deciding how to approach providing insurance to users of GXS Bank in Singapore, and perhaps more importantly, to those of Indonesia-based Superbank, in which Grab and Singtel have a 32.5% stake.

Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt / Photo credit: Wikimedia Commons

Amid TikTok’s lawsuit to block the US government’s potential ban, ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt told Bloomberg that he had once considered acquiring the short-video app, though he is “not currently looking” at a deal.
In its lawsuit, TikTok argues that the law – which would pressure TikTok’s parent ByteDance to sell the app within a year or risk a ban – restricts free speech. Schmidt criticized the law, suggesting that regulating TikTok would be more appropriate than an outright ban.
After leaving Google, Schmidt focused on US-China tensions through the Special Competitive Studies Project, a think tank that aims to boost the Western country’s competitiveness in AI and other emerging tech sectors. Elsewhere in the interview, Schmidt also estimated that the US is two to three years ahead of China in the fast-growing AI field, but that may change should China solve its semiconductor shortages.
US officials have voiced concerns over possible Chinese government access to user data and potential manipulation of user feeds due to TikTok’s links to Chinese parent company ByteDance. Both TikTok and Beijing have repeatedly denied these allegations.
According to a previous report, TikTok may choose to leave the US – a relatively smaller market in its portfolio – rather than sell off the algorithm-rich platform.

Vietnam-based automaker VinFast Auto is set to break into the Philippines’ electric vehicle market in late May 2024. This follows a January 2024 meeting between Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and VinFast CEO Pham Nhat Vuong.
The official brand launch is set for June 1 to 2 for the public. Guests can explore VinFast’s range of EVs, including the VF e34, VF 5, VF 7, and VF 9, six electric motorcycles, and the VF DrgnFly electric bicycle.
VinFast also aims to build a dealer network across the Philippines as EV adoption has been picking up the pace. Sales in the country are expected to reach 6.6 million by 2030.
“I think that the country is ready to go full EV. The technology is there, and the infrastructure is catching up fast,” said Rommel Juan, chairman of Electric Vehicle Association of the Philippines, in a recent interview with local media outlet BusinessWorld.
The expansion marks another lap in VinFast’s race to deliver 100,000 EVs by the end of the year. Considering the target, the company had a slow start to the year, delivering slightly below 10,000 EVs in Q1 2024.
In addition to the Philippines, VinFast – a subsidiary of Vietnamese conglomerate Vingroup – has invested in countries like Indonesia and Thailand, as well as India, Canada, Europe, and the US.

Photo credit: Ringo Chiu / Shutterstock

TikTok and its parent firm ByteDance are pursuing legal action to combat a law that may ban or force a sale of the short-video app, Reuters reported.
The companies believe that the law, which has been ratified by US President Joe Biden, violates the First Amendment free speech rights of the US Constitution. The lawsuit asserts that selling off TikTok is also unfeasible, practically or legally.
ByteDance had been given until January 19 next year to sell TikTok or face a nationwide ban for the app. Should it come down to it, TikTok may choose to leave the US – a relatively smaller market in its portfolio – rather than sell off the algorithm-rich platform, according to a previous report.
According to the suit, the Chinese government had “made clear” that it would not allow ByteDance to divest its recommendation engine, which is “a key to the success of TikTok” in the US. The companies said that moving TikTok’s code to the US “would take years for an entirely new set of engineers to gain sufficient familiarity.”
The companies also stressed that 58% of ByteDance is held by global investors like BlackRock, General Atlantic, and Susquehanna International Group. Meanwhile, 21% is held by the Chinese company’s founder, with the rest by its employees, which include about 7,000 Americans.
TikTok has shelled out US$2 billion to keep the data of its US users safe, according to the lawsuit. The app also agreed to a “shut-down option” that would allow the US government to ban the platform if it violates some commitments.

Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Investment (MISA) has entered into a partnership with Ant International to support the latter’s expansion into the country.
Under the terms of deal, MISA will help Ant International acquire the necessary licenses and permits to operate and establish an entity in Saudi Arabia.
According to a statement, the country will serve as launchpad for Ant International’s further ventures into the Middle East. The region offers an “enormous opportunity for expansion,” said Douglas Feagin, president of Ant International.
Meanwhile, Alipay+, the cross-border digital payments and marketing platform operated by Ant International, has teamed up with Pakistani fintech platform NayaPay to “boost global payments” into the country.
Alipay+ has also been expanding in Southeast Asia since last year. In September 2023, the platform announced integrations with digital payment providers in the Philippines. It has also set up integrations for its mobile wallet ecosystem in Thailand, among other countries.

Singaporean blockchain startup Galaxis has secured US$10 million from backers including Chainlink, as well as Ethereum Name Service (ENS) and ENS’s co-founder Nick Johnson.
Galaxis offers a community management platform that uses digital membership cards in the form of non-fungible tokens to build and reward communities.
The company also offers its platform to non-Web3 communities.
Its CEO Andras Kristof said Galaxis is a “post-hype NFT utility platform,” giving the tech “real value to businesses and individuals in all industries beyond Web3.” Kristof had previously worked with Ethereum since its early days and helped install the first batch of Bitcoin ATMs in Singapore.
Incubated by CoinMarketCap, Galaxis said it has already sold over 225,000 NFTs as a “white-glove service” – meaning they are customized – and plans to further expand distribution through its platform.
Recently, Galaxis announced a US$1 million grant program for community creators and members. The company has also created its native token designed to streamline operations by reducing reliance on third-party tools. An initial DEX offering will be conducted on Bybit, a cryptocurrency exchange platform.

India-based Lendingkart has raised US$10 million through an external commercial borrowing from a fund managed by global impact investment platform BlueOrchard.
The funds will be used for the fintech company’s lending initiatives aimed at micro, small, and medium enterprises.
Lendingkart’s nonconvertible debentures (NCDs) are listed on the India International Exchange (IFSC) in Gujarat International Finance Tec-City, a hub for finance and IT businesses.
Since its establishment in 2014, Lendingkart has provided loans worth over US$1.9 billion. The company has disbursed more than 280,000 loans across all Indian states and union territories. It operates from Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Mumbai, and Gurugram.
Lendingkart has also developed tools based on data analysis and machine learning algorithms to help it evaluate creditworthiness and provide finance-related services.
The firm reported a net profit of US$13.9 million at the group level for 2023. It also secured roughly US$24 million from EvolutionX Debt Capital in long-term debt funding in June 2023.
One of Lendingkart’s competitors, Kinara Capital, also recenly received US$24.4 million in debt funding from a BlueOrchard fund and Impact Investment Exchange.

Runchise, an Indonesia-based F&amp;B management and culinary franchise firm, has secured US$1 million in an undisclosed funding round from prior backers East Ventures and Genesia Ventures. It previously raised an undisclosed amount via a seed round in 2022.
According to a report from Mordor Intelligence, the Indonesian foodservice market – including restaurants, cafes, bars, and cloud kitchens – is set to reach US$103.76 billion by 2029, with a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.43% from 2024.
While this presents a big opportunity, players in the sector face challenges in optimizing their operations – a pain point that Runchise aims to solve.
The company provides solutions for restaurant businesses such as front-store operations, back-office tasks, integration with online food delivery platforms, and customer engagement. Runchise also uses machine learning to provide a daily sales prediction for each outlet.
With the fresh funds, the firm aims to improve its products, branding initiatives, and expand to more cities in Indonesia.
Founded in 2022 by CEO Daniel Witono and COO Ivana Widjaja, Runchise has hundreds of brands as its clients to date. Some of its competitors in the F&amp;B SaaS space in Indonesia include ESB, Moka, Majoo, and Opaper.

Indonesian fintech firm Amartha is eyeing opportunities to expand across Southeast Asia, where many microentrepreneurs face challenges such as limited credit access and low levels of financial digital literacy.
In an interview with Tech in Asia on the sidelines of this year’s Money 20/20 conference, Amartha CEO and founder Andi Taufan Garuda Putra said his company can capitalize on its experience of underwriting loans for Indonesia’s grassroots segments on a large scale. However, he did not specify Amartha’s target markets in Southeast Asia.
Meanwhile, Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (OJK), Indonesia’s financial services authority, has tightened its grip on lending.
While the OJK has lowered interest rate limits to prevent predatory practices, Taufan noted that this regulation is primarily aimed at consumer loans, which are used for purchases that don’t generate income. Amartha focuses on productive loans for small businesses and entrepreneurs, which pose lower risks.
Founded in 2010, Amartha almost collapsed before pivoting from conventional microfinance to peer-to-peer lending in 2015. The company said it has been profitable in the last three years on a net income basis.
Amartha operates a marketplace that links borrowers, particularly those in lower-tier cities outside Java, with institutional and individual lenders. Taufan explained that the company typically receives 60% of the interest rate, while lenders get 40%.
While Amartha uses its own credit scoring system, it employs field agents to assess borrowers and their assets, for example. Taufan mentioned that borrowers from lower-income backgrounds often show more responsibility and appreciation for the loans.
In 2023, Amartha secured commitments of US$285 million in MSME financing from Community Investment Management, International Finance Corporation, and Credit Saison.
Taufan did not rule out the possibility of doing an IPO in the future, noting that “it’s a milestone we want to achieve.”

Hello reader,
It’s much easier to learn from your own mistakes than it is from the mistakes of others.
I can’t count the number of times I’ve received some great advice about a problem in my life, acknowledged how wise it sounded, and then proceeded to do the complete opposite of what I should. I’m stubborn, I suppose.
For instance, for years I persisted in driving a cheap but crappy automatic scooter that kept breaking down, despite being advised by friends to spend just a little bit more on a more reliable semi-automatic. It took one final embarrassing breakdown in front of the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum in Hanoi for me to finally see sense and upgrade my ride.
If I had only been able to learn from the mistakes of my friends who used to drive similarly awful bikes, I would have saved myself a lot of frustrating trips to the mechanic.
As today’s premium story explores, the stakes are a bit higher for emerging markets’ startup ecosystems hoping to learn from the mistakes of the West’s “unicorn factory.”
Today we look at:


How emerging markets are avoiding the mistake of factory-farming unicorns 
More leadership changes at Paytm

Uncoding the unicorn factory

Image credit: Timmy Loen

You’ve likely heard of all the problems with factory-farmed chickens, but what about factory-farmed unicorns? Not the mythical creatures, but startups worth a billion dollars of course. Not all unicorns, though, are made the same.


Spanner in the works: According to American venture capitalist Sem Lessin, the “unicorn factory system” in the Western startup ecosystem is dead. Previously, VCs packaged companies to raise their next round to the next investor without looking at their business fundamentals deeply. This led to disappointing IPOs, such as that of scooter firm Bird. As a result, there’s an existential crisis for US venture capital, but these issues don’t seem to have afflicted ecosystems in emerging markets.

Conditions on the ground: For one, the nascent nature of VC industries in many emerging markets and the lack of supply of risk capital have hindered the development of similar factory systems. In addition, rising digitalization and a growing middle class have given founders ample room to grow, with Brazilian firm Nubank a good example. The fintech company capitalized on the middle class’ growing desire for more advanced digital financial services, and has secured healthy unit economics.

Crypto’s role: While cryptocurrency faces a reckoning in the West amid myriad scams and frauds, the tech still has game-changing potential for startups in emerging markets. With the expense of cross-border payments putting a strain on fragile startups, crypto’s ability to transfer money quickly and cheaply could ease this nightmare.

Musical chairs at Paytm

Indian fintech firm Paytm has named Rakesh Singh as the new CEO of Paytm Money – the company’s investment arm.
The move comes as part of a broader leadership reshuffle at the company.


Moving down the hall: Singh is replacing Varun Sridhar, who will move to a new role as the CEO of Paytm Services. This arm of the company focuses on wealth products and mutual fund distribution.

Saying goodbye: Paytm also announced that Bhavesh Gupta, who headed its payment and lending branches as president and COO, is leaving both roles for personal reasons.

All part of the plan: Just last month, Paytm announced the resignation of Surinder Chawla, CEO and managing director of its banking unit, effective June 26. The company said the new appointments are part of its efforts to expand, drive innovation, and ensure regulatory compliance.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) has announced plans to double its investment in Singapore’s cloud infrastructure, committing an additional S$12 billion (US$8.8 billion) from 2024 to 2028. As of last year, the cloud computing arm of tech giant Amazon had already invested US$8.5 billion in the city-state.
An AWS study predicts that the new investment could add US$17.5 billion to Singapore’s gross domestic product by 2028 and provide around 12,300 full-time equivalent local jobs each year. Some entities that use AWS’ services in the country are Grab, Singlife, Synapxe, and the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore.
“This investment will create a ripple effect across Singapore by increasing economic growth and cloud adoption,” said Priscilla Chong, country manager of AWS Singapore, in a statement.
With the soaring trend of generative AI, the company said it is working with Singapore’s public organizations to develop such tech. The projects AWS is involved in include AI Singapore’s large language model Sea-Lion, GovTech Singapore’s data platform Analytics.gov, and the Maritime and Port Authority’s Maritime Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Digital Hub.
AWS also announced a new initiative called AWS AI Spring to accelerate the adoption of AI, including genAI, in Singapore. The focus will be on developing these technologies for the public sector, local enterprises, startups, communities, R&amp;D organizations, and the workforce.
As part of this program, AWS has signed a memorandum of intent (MoI) with the Infocomm and Media Development Authority. The government agency will use AWS’ AI, machine learning, and AI assistant services to create a program helping local businesses develop their own genAI solutions.

It announced the creation of the Master Plan on National E–commerce Development, which outlined what the government wanted to achieve in the sector by 2025. This included objectives such as 55% of the population participating in online shopping and 50% of small- and medium-sized enterprises doing business on ecommerce platforms.
As such, it’s become abundantly clear that the country is willing to pump a significant amount of resources into ecommerce to fulfill this Master Plan, which should bode well for consumers and businesses that can capitalize on these developments.

Linh Tran Hai, CEO of Sendo / Photo credit: Sendo

At Tech in Asia’s upcoming Saigon Summit, Linh Tran Hai, CEO of ecommerce platform Sendo, will share how he’s scaling his startup and the golden opportunities that will crop up in the sector.
Ahead of the event, we had a one-on-one chat with him to learn more about his thoughts on Vietnam’s ecommerce scene.
The following interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.
How did you become a founder?
Sendo is actually my third startup. The first time I co-founded a company was in 2009.
After my tenure as the head of Lenovo Vietnam and Indochina, I realized that mobile phone screens were getting larger while laptop screens were getting smaller. My bet was that the two devices would “collide,” and that smartphones would probably emerge the winner. So my co-founder and I quit our respective jobs, and started one of Vietnam’s first non-game mobile app companies in 2009, when Nokia was still a dominant player in the market.
My subsequent startups were founded the same way – we spotted a new, irreversible trend in the market, and we went all in.
What are current opportunities for ecommerce in Vietnam?
We have seen the proliferation of marketplace ecommerce and social commerce during the last few years and it’s now mainstream in Vietnam. Nowadays, it’s much easier for a producer to start their own ecommerce service and sell directly to consumers. There’s also a growing number of well-recognized sellers who even sell products through their own mobile apps.

Photo credit: Sendo

Niche markets are emerging as well, such as groceries, furniture, and sport products. Ecommerce is now integrated seamlessly into other sectors too, like online travel agencies, insurance, and banking. With better support services like payments and logistics, the basket size for the ecommerce industry has been consistently growing.
How has your job changed since you first founded your company?
The job of the CEO remains the same. As the company evolves, the tasks and requirements change with it, but ultimately it is the CEO that is responsible for the most challenging questions that the company faces.
Above all, your team is always your most important asset. The goals will always change, but as long as you have a good team, you will eventually get there.
What advice do you want to give to aspiring entrepreneurs?
Be brave, be bold, and always be humble to learn.
What will you be speaking about at Tech in Asia’s Saigon Summit and why is it important?
I will share about Sendo’s journey going through the Covid-19 pandemic, and how the environment opened up an untapped opportunity for the company, leading us to create Sendo Farm. I hope that our story can help the audience understand a bit more about the Vietnamese startup community, and the vast opportunities available in this country.

Org Chart maps out the people at the top of Asia’s most prominent tech companies. Who are the key decision-makers? How are the teams organized? What does it tell us about the company’s priorities? We continue this series with Indonesia-based fintech company Akulaku.
Ant Group-backed Akulaku has had a challenging few months.
The Indonesia-based fintech firm, whose services include buy now, pay later (BNPL) and virtual credit cards, was ordered by the country’s financial services authority (OJK) to halt its BNPL service last October due to alleged violations of supervisory obligations.
Those restrictions were lifted in March this year.
Besides BNPL and credit cards, Akulaku also offers ecommerce and online wealth management services through Akulaku Silvrr Indonesia and Pintar Inovasi Digital (Asetku), respectively.
Akulaku also operates digital banking services through Bank Neo Commerce (BNC). As of May 2023, Akulaku owns a 27.3% stake in the digital bank via Akulaku Silvrr Indonesia.
As competition in Indonesia’s digital banking scene heats up, BNC has beefed up its leadership team with key appointments.
Last month, BNC appointed a former head of commercial banking at HSBC Eri Budiono as its new CEO. Previously, Budiono was also the CEO of Jakarta-based greentech firm TerraThrive.

Budiono has a lot to prove. BNC’s share price sat at 252 rupiah (US$0.02) apiece as of May 6, down roughly 90% from a peak of around US$0.17 in late 2021.
As of March this year, BNC had about 26 million users. Between 2022 and 2023, its total loans disbursed increased 5% to US$663 million, while its losses rose 27% to US$35.2 million.
Apart from BNC in Indonesia, Akulaku also fully owns OwnBank, a banking and financial management app in the Philippines. The platform is run by the fintech firm’s country manager for the Philippines, Patrik Konrad Ticzon.
OwnBank has seen some traction so far: As of January, only a few months after its October 2023 launch, OwnBank had onboarded 500,000 retail customers in the Philippines.
In its home country, Akulaku operates its BNPL service under the entity Akulaku Finance Indonesia (AFI). In 2023, AFI booked 784 billion rupiah (US$49 million) in revenue, a 40.5% decline year on year.
Efrinal Sinaga, former head of the maritime financing task force at OJK as well as former CEO of peer-to-peer lender AdaKita, manages AFI alongside CTO Edy Salim, who recently joined the firm.
Akulaku has come a long way since it was founded in 2016 as a remittance company by William Li and Gordon Hu.
Its wealth management arm Asetku currently has about 22 million users and 67 trillion rupiah (US$4 billion) of loans channeled. Notable executives running Asetku include Kim San, previously head of finance at crypto firm Zipmex, and ex-UangTeman executive Zainal Arifin.
To date, Akulaku has raised at least US$630 million in disclosed funding, according to Tech in Asia data, including a US$100 million debt financing commitment from HSBC Singapore in March. Past investors include MUFG, Peak XV Partners, InnoVen Capital SEA, and Qiming Venture Partners.

Org Chart maps out the people at the top of Asia’s most prominent tech companies. Who are the key decision-makers? How are the teams organized? What does it tell us about the company’s priorities? We continue this series with Indonesia-based fintech company Akulaku.
Ant Group-backed Akulaku has had a challenging few months.
The Indonesia-based fintech firm, whose services include buy now, pay later (BNPL) and virtual credit cards, was ordered by the country’s financial services authority (OJK) to halt its BNPL service last October due to alleged violations of supervisory obligations.
Those restrictions were lifted in March this year.
Besides BNPL and credit cards, Akulaku also offers ecommerce and online wealth management services through Akulaku Silvrr Indonesia and Pintar Inovasi Digital (Asetku), respectively.
Akulaku also operates digital banking services through Bank Neo Commerce (BNC). As of May 2023, Akulaku owns a 27.3% stake in the digital bank via Akulaku Silvrr Indonesia.
As competition in Indonesia’s digital banking scene heats up, BNC has beefed up its leadership team with key appointments.
Last month, BNC appointed a former head of commercial banking at HSBC Eri Budiono as its new CEO. Previously, Budiono was also the CEO of Jakarta-based greentech firm TerraThrive.

Budiono has a lot to prove. BNC’s share price sat at 252 rupiah (US$0.02) apiece as of May 6, down roughly 90% from a peak of around US$0.17 in late 2021.
As of March this year, BNC had about 26 million users. Between 2022 and 2023, its total loans disbursed increased 5% to US$663 million, while its losses rose 27% to US$35.2 million.
Apart from BNC in Indonesia, Akulaku also fully owns OwnBank, a banking and financial management app in the Philippines. The platform is run by the fintech firm’s country manager for the Philippines, Patrik Konrad Ticzon.
OwnBank has seen some traction so far: As of January, only a few months after its October 2023 launch, OwnBank had onboarded 500,000 retail customers in the Philippines.
In its home country, Akulaku operates its BNPL service under the entity Akulaku Finance Indonesia (AFI). In 2023, AFI booked 784 billion rupiah (US$49 million) in revenue, a 40.5% decline year on year.
Efrinal Sinaga, former head of the maritime financing task force at OJK as well as former CEO of peer-to-peer lender AdaKita, manages AFI alongside CTO Edy Salim, who recently joined the firm.

Delivered every Tuesday via email and through the Tech in Asia website, this free newsletter breaks down the biggest stories and trends in emerging tech.

Hi readers,
I grew up seeing friends and family in the Philippines search for greener pastures. That usually means leaving home for good to migrate either to the US or Australia to have better opportunities in life.
In Southeast Asia, investors are doing something similar. While they aren’t leaving the region, they are moving away from their usual destinations such as Singapore and Indonesia for capital gains.
Their next targets? The Philippines and Vietnam.
In this week’s Big Story, I explore why homegrown VCs in these countries are excited despite headwinds while some international investors are still hesitant to funnel their capital into these markets.
Local VCs argue that founders in the Philippines and Vietnam have proven they can build sustainable business models in spite of the capital crunch. But geopolitical tensions and regulatory issues are among the reasons why some have adopted a wait-and-watch approach instead.
In AI Odyssey, I delve into another tale: big tech’s move to Southeast Asia for the backend needs of their AI products.
Last week, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was touring the region, pledging billions of dollars to build infrastructure in support of the company’s cloud and AI needs. The numbers are historic, but I wonder if that could mean more than just financial benefits for all parties.

THE BIG STORY
Vietnam, Philippines attract VCs deterred by pricey Indonesian market, but headwinds bring hesitation

Homegrown VCs believe startups in the Philippines and Vietnam have high potential for profitability despite operating in restrictive environments.

AI ODYSSEY
Promising AI projects we’re noticing
Can Microsoft usher in a new era of AI development in SEA?
Almost every month this year so far, a big tech company in either China or the US has reported updates to an existing large language model or introduced a new LLM that can compete with OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4.
All this work also means that companies are doubling down on spending for data centers that can accommodate the vast amount of data processing these technologies require. Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet have reportedly forked out more than US$32 billion in the first quarter for data centers alone, as noted by the New York Times.
And it looks like Southeast Asia is set to benefit. Case in point: By the end of last week, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella had pledged to invest US$3.9 billion – a historic amount – in Malaysia and Indonesia combined for cloud and AI infrastructure.
He also pledged to build a data center in Thailand for an undisclosed amount.

These moves come amid big tech’s efforts to move away from its reliance on China. With more than 400 data centers, China still had the most number of these facilities in Asia Pacific by the end of 2023, according to Cloudscene, an online marketplace for cloud and data center services.
But doing business in Asia’s biggest market has been complicated in the last few years because of the US-China trade war. China has been actively seeking control over what data gets processed, managed, and transferred to and from its borders. The country, however, remains opaque on what it considers as “important data” that has to be reviewed by its regulators.
Routine data transfers are now bound to be more complicated, which may turn off major tech players. As such, setting up data centers in Southeast Asia makes good business sense, as it has somehow stayed on neutral ground amid the tensions between the US and China.
More importantly, doing business in Southeast Asia – specifically outside of Singapore – is good for big tech’s pockets, as experts have noted.
But could these AI infrastructure pledges translate to high-level skills sharing between big tech and Southeast Asian countries? Microsoft said it would also train locals in AI skills, but the extent of this effort remains to be seen.
This could help Southeast Asians make meaningful contributions to the AI revolution, allowing them to move away from the routine and almost robotic work that they have been doing so far.

847278,2024-05-07T06:00:05,2024-05-06T09:08:07,"For this bicycle subscription firm, personalization coexists with data protection",bicycle-subscription-firm-personalization-coexists-data-protection,publish,post,https://www.techinasia.com/bicycle-subscription-firm-personalization-coexists-data-protection,"Kids constantly outgrow things: clothes, shoes, books, toys, hobbies, and even bicycles.
“We started noticing that we kept buying new bikes that our kid would grow out of, and we didn’t know what to do with the old one,” recalls Roopesh Shah. That’s why in 2022 he co-founded Gro Club, a bicycle subscription startup in India.
The country produces a whopping 15 million bicycles every year, and a lot of them go to waste.

Gro Club’s bicycle subscription service provides customers with a fresh bike for every stage in a kid’s life. When their children inevitably outgrow their bikes, subscribers can simply reach out to Gro Club to return the units and upgrade to ones that meet their current needs. The returned bike is “regenerated”, receiving a comprehensive makeover before being sent out to another subscriber.
“We wanted to make high-quality products accessible to lots of people who would otherwise have fallen back on hand-me-downs or relied on poor quality unbranded products – all while reducing waste,” says Shah, who is also the CTO of the firm.
The personalization era
Since the Bangalore-based company’s founding, Gro Club has already garnered over 9,000 subscribers in the city alone.
To build on that success, the company knew it needed to embed more personalization into the user journey, especially since Gro Club’s business model is built on longstanding relationships with its customers. As such, it provides personalized advice to help customers figure out which bike is right for their child, as well as recommendations for the best accessories to go with their unit.
“It shouldn’t feel like they’re subscribing to a bike,” says Shah. “We want them to feel like they own it.”

In recent years, personalization has steadily grown in popularity among customers and companies, says Harshana Ariyaratne, chief marketing officer at data and identity management solutions provider Affinidi.
Indeed, in a survey conducted by McKinsey, the findings show that 71% of customers have come to expect personalized recommendations and user experiences, while 76% expressed frustration when they don’t receive these personalized experiences.
“All these different platforms do pretty much the same thing, so what keeps your customers transacting on your platform is the experience,” Ariyaratne says. “Further, creating an ideal experience is how many companies effectively build trust with their customers, which is especially important when you’re dealing with parents and kids.”
Going passwordless
To meet the demands for greater personalization, companies are constantly collecting as much data on their customers as possible. However, because Gro Club was built as a platform for kids, data security was a major concern.
“We realized early on that privacy is a key feature that we needed to work on,” says Shah.
Gro Club began working with Affinidi to build privacy guardrails directly into its tech stack. It did this primarily by leveraging Affinidi Login, a passwordless authentication product that eschews traditional passwords.

“Gro Club customers use the app to book a service or raise an issue. It doesn’t require them to create a profile. We send them a time-sensitive one-time password that authenticates them,” explains Shah.
Crucially, customers’ information is stored in a wallet on their device that’s inaccessible to anyone else. “We don’t store any of that data, which totally removes any chances of a breach happening,” the CTO notes.
The benefits of zero-party data
Aside from streamlining the customer experience, Affinidi’s solution helps companies like Gro Club approach customer data in a different way. Typically, Ariyaratne explains, businesses will store users’ data in their own servers, which has resulted in people’s “data being scattered across the internet.”
Depending on how it is collected, most of that data is known as first, second, or third-party data, which marketers are still heavily dependent on.

Harshana Ariyaratne, chief marketing officer at Affinidi / Photo credit: Affinidi

“Marketers have been doing this for 30 years – we try to collect as much data as possible to offer personalized experiences,” says Ariyaratne. “But we haven’t really succeeded because we’re still trying to guess what the customer wants rather than actually asking them what they need.”
A zero-party approach – where customers willingly share their preferences – flips that on its head. It places power back in the hands of consumers by letting them determine how much and what kind of data gets shared.
There’s a lot of business advantages in doing this. For one, this approach is more accurate because the data comes directly from customers.
Further, when customers feel like they have a say in what data gets used, they’re likely to trust a company more, which could lead to higher click-through and conversion rates.
Amid all these advantages, however, there remains concerns about how companies can collect information and operate effectively. After all, by restricting businesses’ access to customer data, it could potentially restrict their ability to provide a high level of personalization.

However, Gro Club’s experience with Affinidi’s solution proves otherwise.
Let’s say, for instance, that a parent is looking to get a bicycle for their child. With Affinidi Vault, the company’s holistic identity management solution, parents can choose to share certain details with Gro Club, such as their child’s age or the kinds of terrain they may be cycling on. With just those small pieces of information, Gro Club can offer recommendations of specific tires or frame heights that would best suit the kid.
“The best part is that if users decide not to share the information, it doesn’t change anything,” says Shah. “We don’t restrict our service, we just default back to the vanilla way of doing things.”
A partnership of equals
When Gro Club first started using Affinidi’s solutions, customers were a little confused, says Shah, but there were many who were also pleasantly surprised.
“We got calls from customers asking about it, so we explained to them that this was optional but also more secure,” says Shah. “The moment the customer understands the weight of what Affinidi could do – that it was clearly showing them what data was being collected and asking permission for it – that’s when the penny drops.”
The Affinidi integration has expanded awareness among parents about how they can create even more security around their children’s data, fostering greater trust between Gro Club and its customers in the long run.

“Our customer lifecycle is measured in years, even over a decade, and subsequent purchases can be years apart,” Shah adds. “Affinidi is really helping us add huge increments of trust in those relationships.”
For Affinidi, working with Gro Club has also brought its own benefits.
“If you want to change a way of thinking at this scale, you need partners who will buy into the mission and who will help us learn as we build,” says Ariyaratne. “Working with Gro Club has given us the real-time customer feedback that we need to really deliver.”
The next move for Gro Club will be to take personalization one step further by figuring out how it can sweeten the deal for customers with promotions or offerings.
“It’s thrilling to be able to put something in front of the customer and get that instant reaction that we’ve met them exactly where they are,” Shah adds.

Affinidi is a technology company dedicated to changing how we think about data ownership. By placing control back into the hands of users, its solutions help companies create better user experiences.

This comes ahead of the company’s anticipated IPO in Hong Kong within the next six months.
However, total losses for the year reached US$70.4 million – a 21.8% jump from 2022. Its operating losses, meanwhile, increased 24.4% to US$58.7 million.

Photo credit: Mirxes

According to the filing, Mirxes attributed the increased losses primarily to higher spending on research and development, which grew 22.3% year on year, to US$22.6 million. A 20% jump in general and administrative expenses also contributed to the higher losses.
Meanwhile, its cash and cash equivalents declined in 2023 to US$14 million from US$19.8 million the year before.
The firm announced its intention to list in Hong Kong last July. In an email interview with Tech in Asia, the company says that an IPO is “a routine fundraising event for biotech companies” and is “not an exit event.”
The company’s latest prospectus also indicates that Mirxes took out a loan for US$25 million in April 2024 and received loans of S$1 million (US$740,000) and US$2 million from co-founder and CEO Zhou Lihan in March 2024.
Responding to inquiries from Tech in Asia, the company says that it chose to take out short-term loans to speed up its path to an IPO.
Mirxes also reported a decrease in total assets and higher liabilities for 2023. However, current assets still exceeded current liabilities in 2023, a pattern that continued to 2024 as of the end of February.
Considering this, Mirxes says that its directors believe that the company has enough working capital to cover at least 125% of its costs for at least the next 12 months from the April filing.
Shuffling revenue mix
Mirxes develops test kits for the early detection of cancer and other diseases. It was spun out of Singapore’s Agency of Science, Technology, and Research in 2014 to commercialize its products and make them more accessible.
Approximately 72% of the company’s revenue is generated from its early detection and precision multi-omics segment, which consists of the GastroClear and LungClear products. The former remains Mirxes’ core product, which is used to detect gastric cancer early.

The company has raised about US$167 million in disclosed funding to date, according to Tech in Asia data. In 2022, it participated in the US$4.5 million funding round of Vietnamese healthtech startup Med247.
Last year, Mirxes indicated its interest in a separate listing in Singapore but still opted to list in Hong Kong first to have a better “fighting chance.”

The company tells Tech in Asia that it made “strategic investments” in its early detection arm in 2022 and 2023 in anticipation of a decline in revenue from its infectious disease unit after the pandemic.
The latter segment – which is mainly carried by its Covid-19 diagnostic test kit Fortitude – contributed just 27.7% of the company’s total 2023 revenue. In 2022, this unit was Mirxes’ main revenue generator, pulling in 42.2% of the total figure that year.
Strategic push into China
Mirxes explains that the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was due to an increase in operating costs as well as in trade and other payables, which refer to expenses incurred from third parties. This took place after the firm raised US$50 million in series D funding in July last year.
The capital was used to support the completion of a GastroClear trial in China, as well as for other initiatives geared toward driving product adoption across Southeast Asian markets. Mirxes also invested in obtaining the Breakthrough Device designation from the US Food and Drug Administration in 2023.
In its latest filing, the company noted that it currently operates two diagnostics manufacturing facilities, one located in Singapore and the other in China.
According to Mirxes, the completion of its GastroClear trial in China will expedite its approval and sales in the country, a market with an estimated 600 million people eligible for stomach cancer screening.

India-based Parseable, a cloud-native log analytics platform, has raised US$2.75 million in a seed funding round led by Surge, Peak XV’s early-stage program, and NP-Hard Ventures.
The funding comes amid rising costs and complexities in log data analytics due to recent advancements in tech, like the rise of large language models and widespread adoption of cloud-based systems.
By 2025, global data creation is predicted to surpass 180 zettabytes, according to Statista. This marks an almost 2x increase from 2022, the year Parseable was founded.
Founded by Nitish Tiwari, Parseable manages, queries, ingests, and stores large volumes of log data using cloud technology. It uses open-source formats like Apache Parquet and Apache Arrow for easier data processing.
In a statement, the company said current log and observability systems struggle to meet modern demands. It added that high costs for large-scale data ingestion, query, and retention often make SaaS-based systems costly, and outdated architecture hampers the efficiency of older products in leveraging modern cloud infrastructure.
“We see a foundational shift of moving away from siloed data infrastructure,” Tiwari said in the statement.
Funds from this round will be used to speed up product development and deepen integration with other platforms. Parseable has also launched version 1.0 of its platform, featuring a scalable data ingestion mode and Azure Blob Store support.

Image credit: Timmy Loen

The latter is what especially excited Vinnie Lauria, founding partner at Golden Gate Ventures (GGV), who oversaw the establishment of the VC firm’s office in Vietnam.
“When you have the Apple and Google [brands] of the world bringing their manufacturing factories in the country, then that spills over to the economy. And that increases the spending power of the people here,” Lauria tells Tech in Asia. “So if I was investing in Indonesia in 2018, I would invest my money in Vietnam right now.”
As interest in Indonesia has pushed the valuation of local startups to levels where they have become uncomfortable for some investors, the search for other market opportunities in Southeast Asia becomes more urgent.
“There is a lot of capital, especially for early-stage startups dedicated only to Indonesia, and that pushes valuation up,” Lauria says. “This is where markets like Vietnam and the Philippines are quite attractive because they are not overvalued. They don’t have too much capital chasing too few deals.”

That said, both the Philippines and Vietnam have already been touted as “the next Indonesia” over the last few years. Yet, funding for startups in these two countries is still far less than what their counterparts in Indonesia get.

So why aren’t international investors opening up their wallets? And will high valuations in Indonesia give startups in Vietnam and the Philippines an edge to attract more investor attention?
Eye on the exits
The current macroeconomic conditions, from high-interest rates to geopolitical tensions, are some of the reasons why many investors outside of Southeast Asia remain hesitant to bring their money into the region, Boon Ping Chua, partner at Cento Ventures, a series-A focused investor based in Singapore, tells Tech in Asia.
“Investors have always been excited about the demographics [of Vietnam and the Philippines]. But you can’t just provide potential, you have to deliver,” he adds.

Tech in Asia data shows that Indonesia has about three times more exits, in the form of mergers and acquisitions or public listings, than Vietnam and the Philippines combined from 2016 until 2023.
The lack of exits in Vietnam and the Philippines – and in Southeast Asia as a whole – leaves investors to “wait and see,” Chua says.

Besides exits, the Philippines has yet to see a unicorn that is not borne out of a corporate-backed entity. Its two biggest startups – GCash and PayMaya – are e-wallets under the umbrella of the country’s two leading telecom firms.
Without much attractive exits to showcase, both Vietnam and the Philippines are left to prove they at least have an enabling business environment, says Roshan Raj Behera, partner at market research firm Redseer Strategy Consultants. “Investors usually wait for a catalyst before sticking their necks out,” he adds.
Government initiatives are one of the ways that other Southeast Asian markets have lured investors for their startups, he points out.
For example, Malaysia’s prime minister has recently launched incentive packages for international VC firms.
A 2023 Asian Development Bank study also noted how incentives for foreign investors by the Indonesian government have encouraged more financing support for VC firms in the country.
Such programs and statements from heads of state in the Vietnamese and Philippine governments have not been as apparent.
Nguyen Nguyen, founder of Vietnamese electric bike maker Selex Motors, tells Tech in Asia that his government has not been as active in funding startups as in Singapore and the US. He shares how Tesla, for example, managed to tap a government loan in its early years to build a production facility that later on produced its first electric sedans.

The Philippines may be more progressive on this front, as it passed a law in 2019 that mandates the creation of a startup fund that provides financing for pre-seed and seed-stage startups. However, the fund only started investing in 2023, and it has only supported one startup so far, pouring about US$200,000 in pre-seed money into energy firm SolX.
Startups in these countries also have greater pressure to build a business model that can be replicated across the region, as they don’t have the scale that Indonesia’s population offers. This is also a factor holding back investors, as regional expansion is a tricky endeavor, Kaidi Gao, a VC analyst at PitchBook, tells Tech in Asia.
“The inherent heterogeneity within the Southeast Asian market makes regional expansion challenging,” Gao says. “For startups in Vietnam, even domestic expansion is a complex process, as regional differences are more pronounced.”
For instance, she says startups operating in Ho Chi Minh City may be afforded a more “commercialized” business environment with clearer rules. But doing business in other parts of the country may require a different strategy altogether, as rules elsewhere can be opaque.
“Bureaucracy and corruption [in the country] constitute another layer of risk from an investor perspective,” Gao adds.
The Vietnamese government was hounded by corruption scandals of its officials during the pandemic. The head of its parliament as well as its president both resigned in the last two months.
Not so easy doing business
It also doesn’t help that regulations in both Vietnam and the Philippines have hung on “uncertainty,” says Chua of Cento Ventures, so doing business within their turfs is already a tough ordeal.
English isn’t the first language for many Vietnamese, and for those who may not be comfortable speaking it, it can be difficult to fundraise and pitch.
In some sectors in Vietnam, for example, foreign ownership is strictly prohibited. Meanwhile, for most industries in the Philippines, foreign investors are only allowed to have a 40% stake in a local business.
Even the process of an overseas investor seeding money into a local startup is a tedious process in Vietnam.
Lauria says doing investments in the country is still not as quick as doing investments in Singapore or Indonesia, but he contends it’s an improvement to how it was a decade ago, when it took six months for one of GGV’s portfolio companies to receive funding. “It can probably just take a month now,” he adds.
However, Redseer’s Behera says that if an investor is eyeing a small market and sees a lot of hassle in bringing in and exiting the money, then it would get them thinking: “Is it worth spending that amount of effort just to get returns for my capital?” Instead, investors may choose to write smaller checks in other markets but have the process be done quickly.
Both Vietnam and the Philippines lag behind their neighbors in the World Bank’s latest Ease of Doing Business rankings. Vietnam stands at 70th, while the Philippines is 95th in a ranking of 190 countries. Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand are all in the top 25.
While Vietnam may be higher in the ranking than Indonesia, which placed 73rd, the latter can offset the bureaucratic roadblocks startups encounter with the available capital they enjoy in the country.

Taku Tanaka, CEO of Kamareo, a Vietnamese B2B marketplace for food supply chain, says he had to pitch outside the country to raise the firm’s latest funding round. He shares that when he began the company in 2019, there were only one or two VC firms available for the startup community in the country. Now, it’s still less than 10.
“I’m the only Japanese in my team and that’s my expertise: to go outside the country and pitch our business,” says Tanaka.
He adds that the language barrier remains a friction point in Vietnamese startups looking to attract investors outside of the country. It’s a sentiment echoed by all investors focused on this market that we spoke to.
“English isn’t the first language for many Vietnamese, and for those who may not be comfortable speaking it, it can be difficult to fundraise and pitch,” Tanaka says.
The language barrier has also become a friction point for investors during the due diligence process for prospective startup investments in the country, observes Gao from PitchBook.
“For a global investment firm to invest in Vietnam, it is important to either have an on-the-ground presence or work with locally based firms there for due diligence,” she says. “Working with intermediaries or third-party service providers is more time-consuming and costly.”
This language barrier also translates to the kind of talent Vietnamese startups manage to attract, says GGV’s Lauria, as he believes those with experience in global tech firms can spell a difference in how local startups operate.
“Just think of Carousell. At a certain point, they had to hire people from Europe to scale the startup, because they needed someone who has had experience in doing that,” he points out.
This is where the Philippines may leverage its English-speaking capabilities.
A breed of founders who were formerly living in the US and building their startups in their home country have become a trend. Kumu, a Philippine video-streaming app, was founded by former US-based Filipinos Roland Ros and Rexy Dorado.
But Paulo Campos, founding partner at Philippines-based VC firm Kaya Founders, admits that the country’s technical know-how has a lot of room for improvement.

“We need to build centers of excellence in terms of science, engineering, and mathematics, so we can produce the technical team our startups demand,” he says. It’s a sentiment most investors we spoke with have echoed.

Can they rise to the challenge?
Still, homegrown VC firms in both countries believe not all are in vain.
Valerie Van Vu, founding partner of Vietnam-based VC firm Ansible Ventures, finds the Vietnamese people’s dedication to quality education as the most “exciting” reason to invest in the country at the moment.
Vu – previously the head of investments in Vietnam for Jakarta-based VC firm Venturra Partners – was so optimistic about the country that she founded Ansible Ventures amid the tech winter in 2022. It has invested in the seed rounds of three startups so far, namely edtech firm NativeX, payment platform Flex, and beauty ecommerce player Zitore.
“Among the countries in the region that spend the most on education, Vietnam is the highest. And that translates to human capital that is focused, has the drive to be entrepreneurial, and the technical skills to do so,” she says.
As per an Asia Partners report, Vietnam is sending more undergraduates to the US than China on a per million basis, and it is second only to Singapore. This could lead to more startup founders coming from Vietnam, as many Southeast Asian platforms were founded by students who went abroad and returned with a “sharper regional perspective,” according to Nick Nash, managing partner at Asia Partners.
Homegrown VC firms in both Vietnam and the Philippines also believe they now enjoy more “experienced” startup talent, as former employees of local offices of the region’s unicorns – like Shopee, Grab, and Lazada – have moved on to building their own startups.
“The early pioneers in that space who saw how to scale companies are taking those experiences and plowing it back into the ecosystem,” Joan Yao, vice president of Philippines-based VC firm Kickstart Ventures, tells Tech in Asia.
Angeline Tham, who previously led the Grab Express service in the Philippines, went on to build local ride-hailing service Angkas, which has 25,000 drivers. Meanwhile, Tran Vu Quang and Le Xuan Long, two former C-level executives of Lazada’s Vietnam office, founded ecommerce enabler Onpoint, which counts global beauty brands Shiseido and L’Oreal as clients.
That said, the tech winter is testing this new breed of entrepreneurs that are more conscious of building sustainable business models. And homegrown VC firms believe it’s the very reason why more international investors will start funding startups in these countries.
“I would say Vietnam is similar to China, which has historically been difficult to do business in,” says GGV’s Lauria. “Yet the country’s economy rose, and it continues to draw investments despite that. I think that’s what can happen to Vietnam, too.”

Indonesia’s GoTo plans to issue a maximum 120.14 billion series A shares, or 10% of its total issued and paid-up capital, via a private placement.
According to a disclosure on the Indonesian Stock Exchange (IDX), the tech firm will use any proceeds raised for working capital and debt repayment in the future, if any.
Of the total proceeds, 35% will go towards GoTo itself. Meanwhile, 20% will be allocated to GoPay, 25% for fintech unit Multifinance Anak Bangsa, and 20% for payment service provider GoTo Solusi Niaga (formerly Multi Adiprakarsa Manunggal) and GoTo’s groceries business.
Aside from this, GoTo previously said it is eyeing an up to US$200 million buyback – its first after its ecommerce deal with TikTok Shop.
“The estimated number of shares to be bought back by the company will not exceed 10% shares included in the current treasury shares,” noted GoTo in its filing.
The company had shown an 89% year-on-year improvement in adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2024. It has said it remains on track to meet its target “to maintain adjusted EBITDA profitability for the full year of 2024.”

Superplum, an India-based agritech startup, raised US$15 million in series A funding led by incoming chair Erik Ragatz.
Founded in 2019, Superplum operates a cold chain infrastructure that the company said can help improve market produce quality. The firm sells fruits like mangoes, lychees, apples, grapes, cherries, and plums.
It said that its cold chain technology extends fruit shelf life, improves fruit quality, reduces waste, and, in turn, increases farmer income.
Superplum also lets consumers access pesticide test reports for each batch of produce, giving transparency from farm to table.
Currently, the startup works with farmers in 22 Indian states, from whom it sources and supplies 25 different fruits year-round.
Superplum’s products are available on various online platforms such as Amazon Fresh, Zepto, Swiggy, and Blinkit, as well as in retail stores.
The fresh funds will enable Superplum to continue to build out its infrastructure and accelerate its expansion in India. The company is also branching out into international markets.
India’s agritech landscape has been seeing traction lately. Arya.ag, an India-based company giving local farmers access to financing, recently said its net revenues rose 20% to US$43 million in the 2023-2024 fiscal year.
Meanwhile, Zetta Farms – which runs sustainable farm projects with its partner farmers – hit US$360,000 in profits in the financial year ended March 2023.

Global investment firm KKR has agreed to acquire Healthium Medtech through the former’s managed funds.
While the size of the deal was not disclosed, a Reuters report cited sources saying that the acquisition was valued at US$839 million.
Healthium is an India-based medical devices company that develops, manufactures, and sells surgical products globally. The acquisition will be done through a special purpose vehicle owned by KKR-controlled funds, aiming to take a controlling stake in Healthium.
Founded in 1992, Healthium – formerly known as Sutures India – provides devices for procedures such as wound treatment and arthroscopy. It was acquired by private equity firm Apax Partners in 2018, and the medtech firm has since expanded from a national suture maker to an international provider of medical devices.
Currently operational in 90 countries, KKR aims to further scale Healthium’s global business, said Akshay Tanna, partner and head of India private equity at KKR.
The closing of the deal, expected in Q3 2024, depends on acquiring regulatory approvals.
Notably, KKR has made multiple healthcare investments in India and the Asia-Pacific region through its US$15 billion Asian Fund IV.
These investments include Indian companies such as JB, Max Healthcare, and Gland Pharma. It has also backed Philippines-based private hospital chain Metro Pacific Hospitals and Japan-based medical equipment manufacturer PHC.

Hello reader,
Eleven years ago, the Singapore government released a whitepaper that projected population growth in the country. The original figure was set at 6.9 million people.
People got up in arms about it, seeing as Singapore was already feeling crowded at the time. The government quickly clarified that 6.9 million was not a target per se, but more of a “planning parameter.”
The response from the populace, however, was a clear display of what many Singaporeans were unhappy about. Jostling with other people on public transport at peak hours was highly annoying, not to mention having to compete for other resources, so the frustration was understandable.
Being a small country, space is an issue that Singapore has always grappled with. However, it’s not just physical space that’s a challenge. The city-state’s business landscape can also fall prey to this conundrum, as evidenced by the local fintech sector.
Today’s premium story looks at the dozens of fintech players operating in small, small Singapore.
Today we look at:

Fintech firms trying to make their mark in the city-state

Premium summary
We’re gonna need a bigger market

Just based on the chart in today’s premium story, there are roughly 200 active fintech firms in Singapore. Yes, I counted, although I might be a little off (and the list we’ve got isn’t exhaustive). Singapore may be known as one of the top financial centers in the world, but isn’t this number a bit too much?
Let’s see how the country’s crowded fintech scene is shaking out.


Way down we go: Funding for local fintech startups was steadily increasing from 2014 to 2022, but there was a significant dip last year, dropping from US$2.3 billion in 2022 to US$1.5 billion in 2023.

Big boys in banking: Most of the biggest funding rounds in 2023 consisted of strategic investments from parent firms into their respective digital banks. This includes Ant Group’s US$188 million injection into Anext Bank and Sea Group’s US$172.5 million investment into Maribank. 

Hype now, slow later: The BNPL space, on the other hand, has been slowing down a fair bit. ShopBack recently discontinued its PayLater service in Singapore, while another local firm, Pace, filed for liquidation.

I wonder if anyone’s ever thought of saying “Vidio and chill” instead of “Netflix and chill.”
Perhaps the Indonesian streaming platform can come up with its own version of the phrase while its embarks on boosting its subscriber numbers in the coming years.


Seeing double: Vidio wants to hit 8 million subscribers over the next two to three years, which is almost double the 4.1 million paid subscribers it says it has as of 2023.

At the precipice: According to Sutanto Hartono, managing director of Vidio’s parent company Emtek, the Indonesian market is approaching a tipping point where paid streaming subscriptions become commonplace in consumers’ daily lives. 

Holes: An important thing to note is that Vidio is still unprofitable. For the nine months ending September 2023, the firm recorded US$42.7 million in losses.

GXBank, a Malaysia-based digital bank backed by Grab and Singtel, has entered into a 10-year partnership with Zurich General Insurance Malaysia and Zurich Life Insurance Malaysia to develop cost-effective insurance products. 
Their initial product, slated for launch in the third quarter of this year, aims to safeguard customers from unauthorized transactions resulting from cybercrime.
Such a product holds significance in the country, as the number of online fraud cases has doubled in 2023 compared to 2019.
Pei Si Lai, CEO of GXBank, said in a statement that this increase in cybercrime, along with a lack of understanding of the need for insurance and lack of affordable options, are some of the main reasons why many Malaysians are still underserved.
Citing a 2023 PwC report, the bank said that about 84% of uninsured Malaysians are aged between 18 and 34.
GXBank was formed by a consortium consisting of Singapore’s GXS Bank – a joint venture between Grab and Singtel – along with a clutch of Malaysian investors, including the Kuok Group. The company launched in November 2023 as Malaysia’s first digital bank.
Other license holders in Malaysia include a consortium led by Sea Group and YTL Digital Capital, as well as a group consisting of Boost Holdings and RHB Bank.

Hello reader,
In India, two phenomena are on the rise: temperatures and the stock market index. Temperatures in my city, Bengaluru, soared to an unprecedented 40 degrees Celsius. Meanwhile, the stock exchange’s bull run persists. The Sensex, India’s benchmark index, has crossed 75,000 points in a historic feat.
These events harbor surprising elements. Bengaluru, renowned for its pleasant weather nationwide, finds itself in an unusual scenario. Similarly, while a bull run typically signifies increased VC investment, there’s a deviation happening here.
Despite a flourishing market and a robust pipeline of IPOs from companies such as Oyo, Swiggy, Ola, and MobiKwik, VC investments in India declined nearly 63% between 2022 and 2023, according to a Bain &amp; Company report.
In this week’s Big Story, I delve into the reasons behind the disconnect between India’s stock market and its VC ecosystem. Meanwhile, it rained in Bengaluru on May 2, offering respite from the heat.

THE BIG STORY

Image credit: Timmy Loen

India’s companies thrive on public markets, but VCs are holding back
Cautious VCs, vigilant LPs, and concerns of potential down rounds among startups have dampened investor sentiment in India’s flourishing market.

3 Trends to keep an eye on
Hot stocks, earnings reports, restructuring, pressure from activist investors, and more.

1️⃣ Copyright chaos: Eight US newspapers, including the New York Daily News, Chicago Tribune, and The Denver Post, have filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft (MSFT, NYSE), claiming that the tech giants used copyrighted articles to train AI models without obtaining permission or offering compensation for the use of the content.
As the use of AI becomes more prevalent, there could be a parallel surge in copyright infringement cases. Training AI models relies on large datasets from various sources such as websites, books, and articles. The implicated tech companies will need to negotiate licensing agreements to avoid future copyright violations.
2️⃣ Retracting IPOs: Recent reports have suggested that India-based FirstCry, an ecommerce firm specializing in babycare products, is considering withdrawing its IPO application due to inquiries from the Securities and Exchange Board of India regarding the company’s key metrics.
Such incidents could have some implications for Swiggy, MobiKwik, Ola, and Oyo, which are all gearing up to list on Indian bourses. With the market regulator tightening its scrutiny of IPO-bound firms concerning their valuation methodologies, other hopefuls in the startup sphere may also find themselves needing to retract their listing plans, particularly those that have yet to achieve profitability.
3️⃣ On the cloud: In the first quarter of 2024, ecommerce titan Amazon (AMZN, NDAQ) tripled its quarterly profit year on year. The figure surpassed US$10 billion, with the growth largely driven by its cloud business. However, the company still noted that ecommerce “remains an essential component of the Amazon flywheel.”
Nevertheless, this marks a crucial moment for Amazon and its AI initiatives as it targets a revenue of US$100 billion from its cloud computing division this year. This comes as the company intends to invest billions of dollars in data centers in Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and the US over the next few years.

2 Eye-popping facts
Tech in Asia scours the internet to bring you head-turning numbers from the world of business.

US$2.2 billion: The amount Microsoft has pledged to invest in Malaysia’s AI infrastructure. This comes amid CEO Satya Nadella’s Southeast Asia tour, where he has made a similar commitment to Indonesia.


89%: The year-on-year improvement in adjusted EBITDA for GoTo (GOTO, IDX) during the first quarter of 2024. CFO Jacky Lo said that the company is on track to “maintain adjusted EBITDA profitability for the full year.”



The one you didn’t see coming
We spotlight the story that had everyone talking and social media buzzing during the past week.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk / Photo credit: Shutterstock

Musk’s Chinese dreams: Recently, Elon Musk landed unannounced in China. Reportedly, the Tesla (TSLA, NDAQ) CEO was in the country to potentially launch the electric vehicle firm’s full self-driving (FSD) software and to discuss permissions for data transfer overseas. He has been seeking Chinese data to improve Tesla’s self-driving tech globally.
The launch of the FSD software could provide a significant boost to Tesla, which has been struggling with sluggish EV sales.
The visit occurs amid escalating tensions between the US and China in the tech sector, notably with the US Senate passing a bill mandating TikTok’s parent ByteDance to sell its US operations in a year or face a ban in the country. If the tension spills to the EV sector, Musk’s Chinese aspirations may remain unrealized indefinitely.

That’s it for this edition – we hope you liked it!

Brainfish, a customer support platform based in Sydney, raised US$2.5 million via its recent fundraising round.
Surge, the scale-up program of VC firm Peak XV Partners, led the round. Macdoch Ventures, Black Sheep Capital, and MadPaws CEO Justus Hammer also invested.
A platform designed to help companies resolve customer queries, Brainfish was established by SiteMinder alumni Daniel Kimber and Ajain Vivek Thankaswamy in April 2023.
They created Brainfish based on their own struggles with customer support, which “hasn’t changed in decades,” noted Kimber, who also serves as the startup’s CEO. “While tooling is better, people today want quick answers that are accurate and contextualized,” he added.
To that end, the company provides AI tools that allows companies to handle large volumes of customer queries. Brainfish says its service can provide answers in under two seconds while giving the businesses’ customer experience team real-time insights generated from client concerns.
Since starting operations a year ago, Brainfish has gained over 300,000 users and serves Australia, the US, and Singapore. Its clients include diverse companies like Mad Paws and Airtasker, which are both listed on the Australian Securities Exchange.

Indian fintech firm Paytm is shaking up its leadership structure to double down on payments and financial services.
Paytm has named Rakesh Singh as the new CEO of Paytm Money – the company’s investment arm. Singh has over two decades of finance experience, including a previous CEO post at Fisdom’s stock broking entity. He previously also held key roles at ICICI Securities and Standard Chartered Bank.
Singh replaces Varun Sridhar, who will be the CEO of Paytm Services, which focuses on wealth products and mutual fund distribution.
These appointments come as the company said that Bhavesh Gupta, who headed Paytm’s payment and lending branches as the company’s president and COO, is leaving his roles for personal reasons. He’ll become a consultant, assisting Paytm’s expansion until the year ends.
In April this year, Paytm also announced the resignation of Surinder Chawla, CEO and managing director of its banking unit, effective June 26. Vijay Shekhar Sharma, Paytm’s founder, also exited the firm’s board in February this year.
According to the company, the new appointments align with its initiatives for expansion, innovation, and regulatory compliance.
The Reserve Bank of India, the country’s banking regulator, earlier this year had mandated the shuttering of Paytm Payments Bank, Paytm’s banking unit, due to regulatory issues. Paytm then ended intercompany agreements with its affiliate bank.
Paytm has since received the green light to become a third-party service provider on the country’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) infrastructure. Before this, Paytm offered UPI services through an exclusive partnership with Paytm Payments Bank.

Since 2006, Tech in Asia has been keeping tabs on Southeast Asia’s M&amp;A landscape. As landmark purchases and M&amp;A deal counts soar to new heights, we’ve put together this piece to help you keep track of the latest trends and milestones.

Before we dive in, here are a couple of caveats about the data:

M&amp;A transactions vary significantly in structure. Some deals may be made under irregular circumstances.
All charts and visuals in this piece refer only to publicly disclosed M&amp;A deals.
In our calculations of mean and median, we have excluded publicly disclosed M&amp;A deals with unknown deal sizes.

SEA’s M&amp;A landscape at a glance
Starting with a broad overview of M&amp;A activity in Southeast Asia, here’s how the overall deal count and deal size in the region have changed over time.

The mean and median deal sizes also reveal trends in the distribution of M&amp;A deals sizes in the region over time.

A look at SEA’s M&amp;A leaderboards
While most of Southeast Asia’s M&amp;A check sizes remain small, deals are made across an increasingly diverse range of industries. Below are the top five verticals that have seen the most M&amp;A activity.

Hi readers,
Imitating features is indeed a common tactic in the tech industry, especially when competing with dominant players. Case in point: Instagram. The social media app has adopted several features from its rivals, such as Stories (previously popularized by Snapchat), and then Reels, which resembles short-form videos on TikTok.
Short videos could be considered one of the keys to TikTok’s current popularity. It’s easy to lose track of time scrolling through videos for entertainment. Live shopping on TikTok Shop, too, has fueled the social media app’s rapid growth.
Although Shopee and Lazada have long been involved in live commerce, this format didn’t really take off until TikTok Shop emerged. This then compelled the ecommerce incumbents to adopt diverse strategies to drive sales, including infusing their apps with social media elements similar to TikTok’s.
Shopee has been aggressively promoting its livestreaming and short-form video features, offering special discounts for purchases through these channels. Its rival, Lazada, also has similar features, albeit not as aggressively marketed.
Therefore, it’s interesting to observe the future landscape of ecommerce, particularly the competition between social media platforms with ecommerce capabilities – like TikTok – and ecommerce platforms with social capabilities – like Shopee and Lazada.
Time will tell whether Shopee’s and Lazada’s moves can fend off competition from TikTok Shop, or whether the latter will eventually still gain a better advantage in that sector.

Hello reader,
Is it just me or is everyone holidaying now? I just got back to work from military reservist, and all I saw on Instagram during my downtime were friends in Japan, South Korea, and other countries I wish I were in.
Maybe I shouldn’t complain. I’m going to Vietnam, Thailand, and Taiwan this year, and might yet add Malaysia and Indonesia to that list. Most of it is for work, though, like our first big conference in Ho Chi Minh City at the end of the month. Nevertheless, it should all be pretty fun and adventurous.
The money in this week’s newsletter is also making its rounds. While a lot of deals originate from India, we do see companies from countries all across Asia Pacific popping up as well.
Just like my travel plans for the year, eh? Spread the love, I say.

❌ “Connected with the Singapore based Principal. Had higher expectations. Instead got junior level responses and questions from him. He appeared uncertain and incapable of taking a definitive position even with simple yes or no questions. After dealing with these guys for a while you can tell when someone doesn’t really have a clue and are just giving answers by rote. It wasn’t the worst experience but overall a letdown.” – Read more

Living Lab Ventures (LLV), the corporate venture arm of property developer Sinar Mas Land, has rolled out the LLV Launchpad, an initiative aimed at supporting global startups expanding to Indonesia.
Located in BSD City – the smart megacity project of Sinar Mas Land – the launchpad is designed to help integrate foreign startups into the Indonesian digital economy.
LLV Launchpad will provide startups with insights into the local market, helping them understand local consumer behaviors and adapt their products accordingly. It will also connect them to investment opportunities.
Sinar Mas Land said it may also tap startups in the launchpad for “pilot projects” in BSD City, but the company didn’t disclose further details on the projects.
Since its launch in 2022, LLV has invested in 27 tech startups in Southeast Asia, including Indonesian companies like Social Bread, Paper.id, and Traveloka.
“Most of these startups are locals, but today we are excited to welcome startups from around the globe to expand their market to our digital ecosystem in Indonesia,” said Mulyawan Gani, chief transformation officer at Sinar Mas Land.
Additionally, in January 2024, LLV launched a biomedical fund in Indonesia to support organizations in the biomedical sector, including healthtech startups, research centers, and biobanks.

Kenangan Brands, the parent firm of Indonesia-based coffee chain Kopi Kenangan, recently launched Satu Kenangan, a more affordable option designed to attract a wider customer base.
As part of its growth plan, Kenangan Brands is opening up Satu Kenangan to partnership opportunities. Interested entrepreneurs can set up their own Satu Kenangan franchise and manage their own operations.
The new business may create more competition for other players in the space. These include mobile cafe firm Jago Coffee, which secured US$6 million in a series A investment recently to expand its presence in Indonesia.
Meanwhile, Satu Kenangan’s hyperlocal focus would complement Kopi Kenangan’s overseas ambitions. The company has ventured into Singapore and Malaysia and is looking to enter a fourth market in the first half of 2024. It has also set a goal of reaching 1,800 outlets globally by 2026.
So far, Kopi Kenangan has bagged US$240 million in funding. Its most recent fundraise was a US$96 million series C round in December 2021 that was led by Tybourne Capital Management.
That round valued Kopi Kenangan at more than US$1 billion, making it a unicorn.

Hello reader,
Layoffs suck. A friend of mine described it as “having your world turned upside down.” One day you have a job, and then suddenly you’re unemployed, through no fault of your own. It’s especially stressful if you have responsibilities like debts to pay off or a family to take care of.
The tech sector has experienced several layoffs in recent years (there was a time in 2022 when it seemed like folks were getting laid off every other day). While that’s slowed down, it’s undeniable that things are still tough for the industry, as companies try to cut costs and keep their heads above water.
In today’s premium story, we take a closer look at the latest layoffs in the sector: the one at logistics firm Ninja Van.
Today we look at:

Premium summary
Layoffs and logistics

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Singapore-based logistics firm Ninja Van has laid off about 10% of its tech staff amid ongoing initiatives to reduce costs.


Why? According to a spokesperson, Ninja Van had done other cost-cutting measures across its tech team, including infrastructural reorganization and outsourcing. In an email sent to staff seen by Tech in Asia, Cheehan Tee, Ninja Van’s vice president for engineering, said that the layoffs were “an absolute last resort” that the company had to take, as the outcome from its previous measures “still wasn’t enough.”

Help given: Workers who have been laid off were given a “reasonable severance package” to help with their transition from Ninja Van, including job placement support, a month of severance pay per full year of employment, and garden leave until their official last day on May 31. 

Some background: The layoffs come after the company’s revenue declined 7% year on year in FY 2023, which was mainly due to an almost 20% drop in parcels handled. Its operating losses also grew 32% in the same period.

News spotlight
Blibli’s Q1 numbers

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Global Digital Niaga, the holding company of Indonesian ecommerce firm Blibli and travel platform Tiket, has announced its results for the first quarter of 2024.


Revenue up:  The firm recorded US$241.2 million in net revenue for the first quarter of 2024, a 2% year-on-year growth. EBITDA losses improved 30% year over year to US$35.1 million during the quarter, and its losses from operations improved by 29% to US$38.4 million.

The why: The company attributed the growth to its focus on categories with higher margins and faster turnover. Tiket also played a role, benefiting from a surge during Ramadan, a period in which Indonesians typically return to their hometowns.

Strong and steady: Take rates also rose to 6.3% from 4.9% in Q1 2023. This helped Blibli’s gross profit before discounts climb 29% year on year.

Quick bytes
1️⃣ Q is for Quantum
California-based PsiQuantum has announced plans to build the world’s first commercial quantum computer in Brisbane, Australia.
The Temasek-backed quantum computing startup has secured US$620 million worth of funding from the Australian and Queensland governments, with a target to build a commercial quantum computer by 2077.
2️⃣ Made by Foodpanda, delivered to you via Foodpanda
Food delivery and e-grocery platform Foodpanda has launched a new private-label selection called “Bright,” which is available on its online grocery shop Pandamart.
Bright offers 1,000 products across three categories: fresh produce, pantry staples and ready-to-eat meals, and household essentials.
3️⃣ Masks off
Gaming lifestyle brand Razer has been ordered to refund over US$1.1 million to its US customers following allegations that it falsely advertised its Zephyr masks as N95-grade.
The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) accused Razer of marketing these masks as N95-grade without undergoing the necessary testing and certifications. A Razer representative, however, told Channel News Asia that the company rejects the FTC’s claims.
4️⃣ Off to different waters
Dhianendra Laksmana has resigned from his position as CFO of Indonesian aquaculture unicorn eFishery. Group CEO Gibran Huzaifah will fill Laksmana’s role as interim CFO.
The management shuffle comes at a time of expansion for eFishery, which launched commercial operations in India in late 2023 and recently acquired an AI-powered IoT startup.
5️⃣ Paying off a loan feels so sweet
Indonesia-based travel giant Traveloka has cleared its US$300 million private credit loan, helped by a post-pandemic resurgence in the travel industry. Traveloka took the loan in 2022 with a 2026 repayment plan.
At the time, it said the funds would strengthen its balance sheet as the travel industry bounces back from Covid-19.
6️⃣ Jail time
Changpeng Zhao, the ex-CEO of crypto trading platform Binance, will serve a four-month prison term after pleading guilty to breaking US anti-money laundering rules.
This is shorter than the three-year period US prosecutors had proposed in April. Zhao’s legal woes have led to a tumultuous time at Binance, which was banned in the Philippines in late March.",We take a closer look at the layoffs at the logistics firm and explore how Blibli fared in Q1 2024.,Stefanie Yeo,Edited by Jaclyn Tiu,open,0,"",https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/1714630878_Newsletter-GIF-Layoffs-and-logistics-1200x640-1.gif,false,"",false,true,false,true,false,5,,976,Behind the recent layoffs at Ninja Van,We take a closer look at the layoffs at the logistics firm and explore how Blibli fared in Q1 2024.,,,"","",""

Apple reported a notable increase in quarterly revenue from China amid a decline in overall iPhone sales globally, Bloomberg wrote.
This announcement, coupled with news of a US$110 billion stock repurchase, propelled Apple’s shares by up to 7.9% in after-hours trading.
China, according to Apple CEO Tim Cook, represents 18% of Apple’s total net sales.
Although Apple has yet to disclose detailed geographical data or specific iPhone shipment numbers, third-party analysts estimate that higher average selling prices could explain the revenue increase despite fewer unit sales in China. Locally, consumers heavily prefer to purchase Apple’s newest releases as well.
Notably, last month, Apple removed Meta-owned WhatsApp and Threads from its App Store in China, following a 2023 law from Chinese authorities that requires the removal of unregistered or outdated apps on iOS’ and Android’s app stores.
Apple is also looking to incorporate Baidu’s generative AI tech into its products in China.
Another smartphone maker looking to capitalize on the AI boom is Huawei. The company recently reported a roughly 6x increase in profit. In addition to smartphones, Huawei also offers AI chips.

India-based Pravis, a growth marketing agency established by Momspresso founders Vishal Gupta and Prashant Sinha, has acquired a stake in StreamO.
StreamO operates within India’s gaming market, linking brands to its network of over 20,000 streamers and 300 million Gen Z subscribers. The company has worked with brands like Intel, Sony PlayStation, Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Spotify.
According to Pravis, global video game content consumption hit 120 billion hours in 2022 on average, and India’s numbers were twice that. StreamO taps into this opportunity through a combination of content, community, and commerce to help brands grow.
Pravis provides services such as influencer marketing, digital video production, and display advertising. It has worked with over 300 brands across industries like babycare, fashion, and edtech.
Gupta and Sinha’s previous venture, Momspresso, was a content platform for mothers and expecting mothers. It eventually got acquired by Mamaearth, one of India’s largest personal care brands.
“Drawing from our learnings from Momspresso’s MyMoney platform, we understand the dynamics of microinfluencer and brand interactions very well,” said Sinha. MyMoney was a feature that let mothers participate in brand campaigns and earn money.

In 2023, the country took the spotlight as the world’s top destination for IPOs, with 57 listings such as Tata Technologies and IdeaForge Technology, which collectively raised 494.3 billion rupees (US$5.9 billion). This was an upswing from 40 IPOs in 2022.

Typically, a bustling IPO and stock market correlates with increased venture capital investment. Outperformance on the stock market, alongside exit events, are a chance for investors to realize capital gains and free up funds that can be channeled to new investment opportunities.
However, VC investment in the country actually declined nearly 63% between 2022 and 2023, a report from Bain &amp; Company shows. Deal count also fell from 1,611 to 880, while average deal size fell from US$16 million to US$11 million during the same period.
The report noted that despite this significant decline, India retained its position as the second-largest destination for VC and growth funding in Asia Pacific, only ranking behind China.
So why is there a disconnect?

The reset is real
Industry observers Tech in Asia spoke to say that since 2023, VCs in India have become more discerning of the businesses and founders they back. That’s because many of their past investments have fallen short of their expected returns, which have led to a slowdown in funding.
Last year, Scott Shleifer, a senior advisor at Tiger Global, said returns on India investments had “sucked historically” compared to other global internet firms like Google, Facebook, and Tencent. The investment firm has invested in prominent India-based companies such as Ola, Flipkart, and Paytm.
On an investor call, Schleifer noted that many startups in the country faced governance issues and struggled to achieve profitability.
In 2023, for instance, Indian car servicing startup GoMechanic admitted to financial reporting lapses. This prompted early investors like Peak XV Partners (formerly known as Sequoia Capital India) and Orios Venture Partners to file a police complaint against the startup’s founders.
Concerns about inflated sales figures at healthtech startup Mojocare also led its investors, including Chiratae Ventures, B Capital, and Better Capital, to request a forensic audit of the firm’s financial records.
Another part of the problem? Many companies in the country raised funds at unsustainable levels. By and large, if an entrepreneur had demonstrated product-market fit, they would secure funding, industry observers note. Then, as they aimed to solidify product-market fit, they would secure funding once more, sometimes within a span of a few months.

“This behavior of multiple funding rounds into a business in less than a year at crazy valuations spoiled the market,” Karun Arya, chief growth officer at alternate finance platform GetVantage, tells Tech in Asia. Startups who raised funds at unsustainable valuations later found it difficult to raise follow-on rounds.
As a result, many homegrown companies like edtech major Byju’s, medtech startup PharmEasy, and social media platform ShareChat – once hailed as the flag bearers of India’s startup ecosystem – have witnessed a significant erosion in their valuations.

There’s undoubtedly a reset underway in the ecosystem, as VCs are shifting their focus to backing firms that have a road map toward profitability and sustainable growth, Arya observes.
Growing pressure from LPs
Another reason for the slowdown in startup funding in India is the growing pressure that limited partners (LPs) have put on VCs.
Typically, venture funds operate within a 10-year time frame to invest their capital and subsequently deliver profits to their LPs.
However, India-based venture capitalist Anup Jain tells Tech in Asia that LPs in the country become impatient by the fifth year, and they begin seeking tangible results. “This psyche is very well established in India,” he adds.
Large-scale exits – whether through M&amp;As, public offerings, or secondary markets – in India remain unpredictable for the most part. The lack of transparency between VCs and their LPs on what pathways to liquidity look like, especially once a fund crosses five or six years, is a primary concern among LPs, notes Karthik Reddy, co-founder and managing partner of Blume Ventures, in a report.
See also: Singapore firms’ love affair with Nasdaq continues despite post-IPO heartaches
This, in turn, has led to a reluctance among global LPs, particularly those used to more frequent and larger liquidity events in other markets, to invest in new funds, according to Reddy.
While Peak XV Partners managing partner Rajan Anandan pointed out last December that the Indian startup ecosystem is sitting on US$20 billion in dry powder waiting to be allocated, sources Tech in Asia spoke to beg to differ.
An India-based investor who requested anonymity notes that many VC funds that claim to have bagged fresh capital have not done so in practice. Often, such eye-popping numbers are “smoke and mirrors” and have to do with “optics,” the person notes.
Lead-lag effect
In due time, what goes up must come down – and vice versa. This holds true for India’s VC ecosystem.
Indeed, signs of recovery are starting to show: VC investments in India have reportedly doubled in the March quarter, touching US$3.2 billion, as compared to US$1.6 billion in the December quarter.

Despite facing setbacks in India, Tiger Global is also maintaining a bullish outlook on the market.
The rise of AI is another positive, as VCs are keen on investing in this disruptive sector. The deeptech segment, which includes AI-focused startups, is already seeing a year-on-year rise in funding. The Indian government has also earmarked nearly US$240 million to fund and support AI-related startups.
In their efforts to successfully go public with a fair valuation, startups are trying to demonstrate that they have at least a full year of profitability, observes Jain, who is a former managing partner at Orios Venture Partners.
Indeed, companies that have prioritized profitability over growth are now lining up their IPOs for 2025. Firms such as payments platform MobiKwik and travel tech startup Ixigo, which delayed their IPOs to get into the black, will now pick up the pace and go to the market, as they have turned profitable.
In January, MobiKwik refiled documents with the Securities and Exchange Board of India to launch an IPO, with plans to raise US$84 million.
Ixigo’s parent firm also filed its draft papers in February to raise US$14 million through an IPO.
As profitability efforts carried out in 2023 are likely to yield results in the next few years, 2025 “holds great promise for profitable companies,” Jain notes. “We might see a good 30 to 40 companies wanting to list themselves in one shot,” he predicts.
With major IPOs from tech companies like Oyo, Ola Electric, and Swiggy on the horizon, it’s shaping up to be a reset year for India’s investment ecosystem, which could potentially boost investor sentiment.

Hello there,
Is being ambitious ever a bad thing?
If we were to judge by the average dating-app profile, the answer would be a resounding “no,” but Bumble isn’t the arbiter of these things. Ambition needs to come with a dose of realism. After all, if you try to do considerably more than you’re capable of, you may end up achieving very little.
Chinese automaker BYD has very ambitious goals to expand its manufacturing dominance beyond cars and batteries as well as to capture more market share outside China. But as today’s Deep Read explores, achieving those goals may be a tall order given the geopolitical climate the company finds itself in.

THE BIG STORIES
1️⃣ Are SEA’s deliveries about to get greener? These logistics startups think so

Mober CEO Dennis Ng / Photo credit: Mober

Logistics startups are driving the mainstream adoption of electric vehicles across Southeast Asia, with the benefits including savings on operational costs and reducing carbon footprints.
However, the lack of EV charging infrastructure remains a challenge, as does access to financing.
2️⃣ Climate tech has a bankability problem, but there are 3 ways to fix that
Climate tech startups are far from easy to fund, given their large capital requirements, the long timeframes to provide a return, and the lack of data needed to underwrite bank loans.
But with a focus on demystifying climate tech technology, de-risking investing in this sector, and designing fund mechanics specifically for companies in this space, these hurdles could be overcome.

DEEP READ
1️⃣ The ambitions of China’s BYD stretch well beyond electric vehicles

Image credit: Timmy Loen

BYD accounts for one in three new EV sales in China, the world’s largest auto market, but the company has green manufacturing ambitions beyond the sector and beyond the firm’s native country.
While it’s a battery company at its core, analysts say the firm wants to become “an energy ecosystem company.” It currently makes lithium batteries, solar modules, as well as electric-powered buses, trucks, and trains.
While BYD has the advantages of a vertically integrated structure, economies of scale, and large investment in research and development, could it be biting off more than it can chew?
BYD’s ambitions to go global come at a particularly inauspicious time, given the trade tensions between China and the US, as well as increased worldwide scrutiny of the economic risks posed by Chinese firms.

1️⃣ Tesla trims over 10% of global workforce amid lower sales
Tesla’s stock price may be up after CEO Elon Musk’s trip to China, but the firm is also feeling the bite of tough competition in the EV sector. Recently, the company laid off 10% of its global workforce amid falling sales.
Why it matters:
Competition in the EV industry should be good for consumers on the one hand, as it leads to more affordable options at higher quality. On the other hand, if competition leads to companies struggling to balance their books, it could harm the sector in the long run.
2️⃣ Eco-friendly data centers help drive $6.3 billion of green investment in Southeast Asia, but report shows more needed
A report by Bain &amp; Company, GenZero, Standard Chartered, and Temasek found that US$6.3 billion of green investments flowed into Southeast Asia in 2023, with gains mostly driven by green data centers. However, the report cautioned that more investment is needed for the region to hit climate goals.
Why it matters:
A 21% year-on-year increase in investment is nothing to be sniffed at, but the fact that much more is required shows that a lot of work still needs to be done. Green data centers’ prominence is encouraging, given how the industry is expected to grow due to the rise of generative AI.
3️⃣ Global battery rollout doubled last year – but needs to be six times faster, says IEA
New batteries totaling 42 gigawatts were plugged in globally last year – more than double from 2022, according to a report by the International Energy Agency (IEA). However, rollout will need to be much faster for the world to reach its renewable energy goals.
Why it matters:
Simply put, all the renewable energy in the world is no good if it can’t be stored in batteries and used when needed.
4️⃣ VinFast hits $618m in Q1 net loss despite doubling revenue year on year
The Vietnam-based EV manufacturer logged a net loss of US$618.3 million for the first quarter of 2024. The figure was more than double its revenue of US$302.6 million in the same period.

Why it matters:
VinFast has ambitious goals, including delivering 100,000 EVs this year. But as of the end of Q1, it had delivered just 9,689. Should they continue, sizable losses like this one will undermine the company’s business case.
5️⃣ Cooling down urban campuses: Can AI do it in a sustainable way?
As the world heats up, air conditioner use is predicted to soar and increasingly drive electricity demand, potentially creating a vicious circle. This article looks at how real estate developers and corporations are exploring more efficient ways to keep buildings cool.
Why it matters:
Anyone who works in one of Asia’s larger cities knows how big of a difference a cool office versus an overheated workplace makes. If optimal temperatures can be reached without relying on air conditioning, all the better.

Vidio app / Photo credit: Vidio

Vidio, an Indonesia-based streaming platform owned by local conglomerate Emtek Group, is aiming to boost its number of paid subscribers to 8 million over the next two to three years, Bloomberg reported. The target would roughly double the 4.1 million paid subscribers it claims to have as of 2023.
The goal comes as Vidio plans for an IPO, as well as a fundraise through its parent company, Emtek managing director Sutanto Hartono told the publication.
Despite having a higher paid subscription count than rivals like Viu, Disney+, and Netflix in Indonesia, Vidio comes in second to Netflix on metrics like premium viewership and monetization, per data from consulting and research firm Media Partners Asia.
However, Hartono believes the Indonesian market is approaching a tipping point where paid streaming subscriptions become commonplace in consumers’ daily lives. To transition more customers from traditional TV, Vidio is emphasizing sports broadcasts and local soap operas, among other strategies.
Previously, Hartono disclosed that Vidio has a valuation of US$945 million – near unicorn – after its latest US$45 million funding from Sinar Mas Group, Grab, and Bali United in June 2022.
However, Vidio is still unprofitable. For the nine months ending September 2023, Vidio recorded US$42.7 million in losses – a 53% increase year on year – although net revenue was up by 40% to US$48.5 million over the same period.
With Indonesia’s digital media market on the rise, US$2.25 billion in online video revenue is forecasted by 2028, compared to US$1.3 billion in 2023, according to Media Partners Asia. The expected nationwide rollout of 5G technology could further fuel growth in digital streaming.

As the AI trend expands beyond the English-language sphere, there has been a growing emphasis on building AI models and tools that can support other languages.
Hong Kong-based Fano Labs is one company with that aim. Founded as a spinoff from the University of Hong Kong in 2015, the startup offers “language AI technologies” including an AI transcriber, chatbot, and voicebot that can handle conversations in multiple languages or even involve specific dialects.
After securing undisclosed investments in 2017 and 2022, Fano Labs recently completed its series B round, which was led by Openspace Ventures. HSBC, Greater Good Investment, and the family office of Hong Kong billionaire Kenneth Lo also joined the fundraise.
Fano Labs’ products support languages including English, Mandarin, Cantonese, French, and Japanese. Its clients include major financial institutions such as Citibank, DBS Hong Kong, Hang Seng Bank, and HSBC, which use the products for customer service and other areas.
With the fresh funds, Fano Labs plans to improve its products and open an office in Singapore for international clients.
One upcoming product is Callinter, a system that can rapidly analyze multiple hours of audio. This helps to identify misconduct or misselling, an especially useful function in the compliance-heavy financial services industry.
Investing in AI has become popular in Asia, and the most active backers include Antler, KB Investment, Iteractive, and KDB Bank. Global tech giants like Microsoft and Apple are also betting huge amounts on data centers and AI development in the region.

Hello reader,
Since we’re putting on so many new events this year – Saigon Summit is coming on May 30, and the Kuala Lumpur version of our flagship conference will be at end-July, and that’s just for starters – my team and I have had the opportunity to be more involved with event content planning.
I’ve learned a ton from the process, but one thing you quickly realize is that it’s impossible to cover everything.
Due to limited slots, some good topics may need to be left off the agenda; the ideal speaker for a given subject may be unavailable, or a last-minute logistics mishap may necessitate more changes. The list goes on, and all we can do is try our best to keep things as on-track and the content as informative and useful as possible.
According to my colleague Emmanuel, that balance wasn’t struck well enough at the KL20 Summit, a Malaysian tech and startup event backed by the government. Too much rehashing and not enough new ideas, apparently. Read on for his full critique.
Today we look at:

KL20 Summit and a potential missed opportunity
GoTo’s deconsolidation of its logistics unit
Other newsy highlights such as Microsoft’s billion-dollar investment in Indonesia and layoffs at Ola

Doing what’s been done before vs. trying new things

Image credit: Timmy Loen

In times of flux (and oh boy has the tech industry been fluxxing the past year and a half), it’s tempting to cling to the things you’re familiar with. At work, that might mean focusing only on the tasks you’re best at, instead of the new and unfamiliar initiatives that are necessary for progress.
That looks like my colleague Emmanuel’s main criticism of the agenda at the KL20 Summit – too much doubling down on old ideas and not enough differentiating.


Golden goal: Among the main initiatives that Malaysia has been highlighting for its tech hub strategy are the Unicorn Golden Pass, Innovation Pass, and VC Golden Pass, which offer various incentives and subsidies for global unicorns and VCs to set up shop in Malaysia.

Nothing new: However, there have already been similar initiatives done before: Mavcap had implemented an outsourced partners’ program over a decade ago to woo international VCs, while the Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation had previously offered similar perks to set up offices in the country.

Notes for next steps: Among other suggestions, Emmanuel posits that instead of luring in foreign talent, Malaysia should nurture or fund local businesses and professionals instead.

Bye bye, GoTo Logistics

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Indonesian tech firm GoTo Group has announced that it will deconsolidate its logistics unit associated with Tokopedia in the second quarter of 2024.


What’s next: The group previously acquired 99.8% shares of Swift Logistics Solutions, Tokopedia’s logistics arm, in January 2023. However, following the deconsolidation, this unit will return under Tokopedia.

Staying home: GoTo said that its B2B delivery business and on-demand delivery unit will stay within the group.

Dominoes: This isn’t the first time GoTo has divested a business unit. In August 2023, the company sold its entertainment business GoPlay and ticketing platform Loket to former executives.

The region accounted for almost two thirds of global EV sales as of 2022, with significant jumps in both plug-in hybrid EV and battery EV sales.

Photo credit: Kia

Unsurprisingly, even traditional vehicle manufacturers like Kia Corporation have joined the fray. The South Korea-based company is not only introducing new EVs, but it’s also ensuring that these additions meet the needs of the modern customer.
“By responding effectively to changes in the mobility market and efficiently implementing mid-to-long-term strategies, Kia is strengthening its brand commitment to the wellbeing of customers, communities, the global society, and the environment,” Ho Sung Song, president and CEO of Kia, said in a statement.
The more, the merrier
In 2020, Kia announced a strategy called Plan S. It has three main pillars: transitioning the company’s product lines toward EVs, strengthening its EV business, and expanding mobility-related services.
Recent developments in the region’s EV market, however, could affect these goals. For one, subsidies for EV purchases provided by countries such as China and Thailand are winding down. With monetary incentives fading out, EV manufacturers need to improve and expand their offerings to continue gaining customers.
Accordingly, Kia announced that it would be upgrading Plan S earlier this year. Instead of the original aim of rolling out 11 EV models by 2025, the company plans to launch 15 by 2027, including nine plug-in hybrid EVs by 2028.
Kia is strengthening its brand commitment to the wellbeing of customers, communities, the global society, and the environment
The company is also expanding its physical presence across several Asia Pacific markets to better meet customers where they are.
In Thailand, it established a new sales unit in January and introduced the EV5 model – for the first time in Southeast Asia – at the Bangkok International Motorshow 2024. These moves shouldn’t come as a surprise, given that Thailand is a powerhouse in the region’s automotive industry and the growing adoption of EVs in the country over the last few years.
S is for supercharged
Apart from its Plan S strategy, Kia has taken several steps to improve the capabilities of its EVs to meet customers’ needs.
“Kia is keenly focused on providing solutions to the concerns that continue to cause hesitation when it comes to making an EV purchase,” said the Kia president. “We want to make the entire customer journey as effortless and enjoyable as possible.”
One of the hurdles is how long it takes to charge EVs, which often depends on the charging outlet being used. Wall chargers, which are typically used at home, require waiting several hours before batteries are recharged. In comparison, purpose-built charging stations can pump out a full charge in under an hour.

However, there’s another critical factor at play: how quickly the car and its battery can accept a charge.
To that end, Kia has developed a platform that incorporates fast charging technology into the vehicle and battery, bringing charging times down to as little as 18 minutes for an 80% charge for its EV6 model.
The Kia Electric-Global Modular Platform and its fast-charging capabilities are included in several of the company’s latest EV models, including the EV9 and EV5 which were unveiled for international markets in March 2023 and October 2023 respectively.
Kia is also looking to drive sustainable practices in EV production across the board to zero in on the goal of reducing the carbon footprint. After all, the production and the eventual disposal of vehicles can have a huge impact on the environment.
For example, more vehicles are being made with plastic components instead of metal, and so are more than a third of the car parts used in today’s models. While this is great for fuel efficiency – the less metal used, the lighter the car – many commonly used plastics, such as polyethylene, aren’t biodegradable on their own.
To keep its cars as green as possible, Kia developed a design sustainability strategy that lays out ten environmentally friendly materials to use in vehicle production. This includes bioplastics and recycled polyester fabric as well as other recycled and biodegradable materials.

“In order to become a sustainable mobility solutions provider, Kia needs to continue its efforts to establish an innovative and customer-centric business model,” said the president.
As such, it launched the EV9 model in Southeast Asia earlier this year, a three-row SUV that is the first vehicle to fully embrace the design sustainability strategy. The model has bagged several awards, such as World Car of the Year and World Electric Vehicle at the 2024 World Car Awards, solidifying Kia’s accomplishments in developing new technological capabilities.
“We want our brand to provide environmentally responsible mobility for all and to be a symbol of innovation and progressive solutions,” said Karim Habib, who serves as head of global design and is an executive vice president at Kia.
The road ahead
With many of its models already on the road, Kia is gearing up to develop other areas and improve its offerings.
The company is working on AI tech to boost convenience and safety for drivers as well as to strengthen its sustainability push. For instance, it aims to replace all electricity demands at its workplaces globally with renewable energy, with goals of 66% by 2030 and 100% by 2040.
“Kia is enhancing its global business strategy to further the establishment of an innovative EV line-up and accelerate the company’s transition to a sustainable mobility solutions provider,” said the president.

Founded in 1944, Kia has been a major player in the automotive industry for several decades. The company continues to evolve to meet today’s changing needs and demands, moving beyond being a traditional manufacturer to become a mobility brand. To find out more, visit its site.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has added another pledge during his whirlwind Southeast Asia tour. Just a few days after announcing a US$1.7 billion commitment in Indonesia, the tech giant has committed US$2.2 billion for Malaysia’s AI infrastructure, reported Bloomberg.
Similar to its Indonesia pledge, this would mark Microsoft’s largest single investment in Malaysia. Part of its strategy is to offer AI education to 200,000 Malaysians, with the southern region of Johor expected to become an AI hub.
Microsoft has also announced that it will launch a regional data center in Thailand. The company aims to provide AI training to 2.5 million individuals across Southeast Asia.
Amid US tensions with China, Southeast Asia has increasingly become a focus for American tech companies. Last month, Apple CEO Tim Cook made a similar trip to the region, announcing investments in Singapore, Indonesia, and Vietnam.
Chipmaker Nvidia also recently announced a US$200 million co-investment in an Indonesian AI center amid a wider push in Southeast Asia. In addition, the company plans to set up an AI center in Singapore and a pilot manufacturing plant in Malaysia, as well as expand its partnership with Vietnamese tech firms.
Consulting firm Kearney expects AI to boost Southeast Asia’s economy by US$1 trillion by 2030. Of this, Malaysia could gain nearly US$115 billion, while Indonesia could capture US$366 billion.

Shopee and the ecommerce platforms mimicking TikTok Shop

What a potential ban for TikTok in the US might mean for Southeast Asia
Why Temasek is making a bet on Yuu, the consumer loyalty platform


Hi there,
How much time do you spend on TikTok?
In Southeast Asia, over 500 million people spend 10 hours a week on social media platforms.
Ecommerce platforms, too, are now vying for consumers’ share of attention. Expecting viewers and creators to use a shopping app as they would a social media app, though, is a tall order.
In this week’s Big Story, my colleague Jofie looks at Shopee’s efforts to dial up its short-video offerings and build up a content library.
The ecommerce marketplace isn’t just drawing sellers onto the platform, it’s also enticing content creators to upload the same videos they would on TikTok – from funny sketches to life hacks.
Of course, Shopee isn’t the only ecommerce platform trying to mimic TikTok Shop’s success – Lazada and Tokopedia have also introduced short-video features on their respective marketplaces.
But those early efforts could be threatened by a potential ban on TikTok in the US, which may cause the firm to redirect efforts into Southeast Asia. I examine the potential impact of that in this week’s Hot Take.
— Melissa

THE BIG STORY
Shopee ramps up short-video efforts, but can it fend off TikTok Shop?

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Shopee is offering deep discounts on its short videos channel to draw in younger users, creators, and new sellers. It’s already seeing some results.

THE HOT TAKE
TikTok’s US ban might not be good news for Southeast Asia

Photo credit: 123RF

Here’s what happened:

Last week, the US Congress passed a bill that mandated ByteDance, TikTok’s parent firm, to divest the short-video app’s US assets in 270 days or face a ban.
ByteDance would choose to shut down its US operations rather than sell it, said a Reuters report citing sources.
TikTok is set to challenge the bill on First Amendment grounds.

Here’s our take:
Could a potential TikTok ban in the US lead to the short-video app focusing more of its efforts in Southeast Asia, where it has more than 325 million monthly active users? Observers think so.
While Southeast Asia may not match the US in terms of market size, spending power, or advertising dollars – TikTok’s main revenue stream – an outright ban will likely force the company to refocus its efforts in its other existing markets.
Indonesia and its 125 million TikTok users – which makes it the firm’s second largest market after the US – becomes of interest.
In a recent interview, Jianggan Li, founder and CEO of venture builder Momentum Works, said he expects TikTok to devote more resources to ensure it is compliant in existing markets.
That said, the short-video app has faced its fair share of scrutiny in Asia. It has been banned in India since 2020, has faced a probe in Vietnam over “offensive” and “toxic” content in the country, and narrowly made a comeback in Indonesia after merging with local ecommerce platform Tokopedia.
In Malaysia, where TikTok does not have a representative, it also came under scrutiny last year over the spread of fake news on the platform.

What might devoting more resources in Southeast Asia look like?
Ecommerce marketplaces from Shopee, Lazada, and Tokopedia will find little reprieve, just as they’ve stepped up on their short video and livestreaming offerings, where they’ve made some inroads.
TikTok could see bigger pushback from entrepreneurs and SMBs who are seeing their margins being pinched by Chinese sellers and their cutthroat prices, already a sore point for SMBs in Malaysia. For the many sellers who now depend on TikTok Shop for a living, however, more seller support could be a boon.
Already, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said in 2023 that the firm is looking to invest “billions of dollars” in Indonesia and the rest of Southeast Asia over the next few years. The firm had also planned to invest US$12.2 million over the next three years into supporting over 120,000 small businesses and entrepreneurs in the region, he said at the time. That might well increase.

Not everyone, though, is overly concerned with TikTok’s eventual fate in the US.
TikTok is “not going away,” Mike Pusateri, CEO of Los Angeles-based Bent Pixels, told me earlier this month. The firm connects YouTube creators with brands, and it also works with TikTok creators in Asia to do the same via Bent Pixels Asia – a joint venture between Bent Pixels and Hepmil Media Group.
He believes that TikTok “will be acquired … I do think there probably needs to be some slight algorithm changes and some other adjustments in the US market – I think that’ll occur if it’s owned by a US company – but it’s not going away.”

Chinese automotive manufacturer BYD is investing US$1.3 billion to build an electric vehicle plant in Indonesia. The plant, located around two hours from Jakarta in the West Java province, is expected to begin operations in January 2026, targeting to produce up to 150,000 units per year.
BYD’s investment makes it the latest automaker to set up EV manufacturing operations in Indonesia. South Korea’s Hyundai and China’s Wuling have both had EV plants in the country since 2022.
For the plant, BYD is teaming up with Suryacipta Swadaya, the industrial estate arm of IDX-listed construction firm Surya Internusa Group. Suryacipta owns the Subang Smartpolitan industrial zone, where BYD’s factory will be located.
In a press conference on Thursday, BYD Motor Indonesia president director Eagle Zhao said that the project will provide jobs for “thousands of workers,” local publication Kontan quoted.
The plant development was first revealed by Airlangga Hartarto, Indonesia’s coordinating minister for economic affairs, in January. At the time, Zhao said that the company aims to sell in 50 locations across the country by the end of this year.
BYD, which has quickly risen to become a major global EV player, unveiled three electric car models for the Indonesian market earlier this year. It also secured a deal with local taxi company Blue Bird to become its main EV supplier.

It was moderately edited to reflect Tech in Asia’s editorial guidelines.
Sam Lessin recently pontificated on the end of what he called the “unicorn factory system.” The American venture capitalist described a configuration in which each investor along the fictional assembly line packaged companies to raise their next round, forgoing any deep questioning of the companies’ business fundamentals.
This system, Lessin argues, has led to disappointing IPOs such as Bird, whose underlying unit economics did not stand up to the test of public scrutiny.

Adding insult to injury, Lessin posits that the good companies to come out of that era, such as Stripe, were kept private while the not-so-good companies were dumped on public markets via shady blank-check or SPAC listings. In the US, stringent antitrust regulation has also reduced big tech’s propensity to acquire startups.
The increasingly disenchanting exit path for startups on the factory line has created a snowball effect, where the entire sector’s attractiveness to limited partners, employees, and would-be founders has decreased. The end of Covid-induced zero-interest-rate policies has also turned off the seemingly endless tap of funding the sector used to enjoy.
The result is an existential crisis for US venture capital, which Lessin predicts will usher in the return of more artisanal, less “predictable” VCs and companies.
The emerging market difference
This doesn’t seem to have afflicted emerging market startup ecosystems as severely, for various reasons.
VC industries in many emerging markets are still nascent. There is, in large part, a lack of local VCs capable of leading post-series B fundraises.
Despite American VCs’ 2021 foreign forays, most emerging market ecosystems still face a concrete undersupply of risk capital. This has hindered the development of any such “factory” system – for the better.
According to a 2023 report by Magnitt, there were a record number of deals and exits in the “MEAPT” (Middle East, Africa, Pakistan, and Turkey) region last year. This is more of a personal observation than a scientific demonstration, but I suspect emerging markets’ comparatively lenient antitrust laws are more conducive to a vibrant M&amp;A market.
Most successful startups in emerging markets solve “real” problems. Capital constraints force local founders to find – not invent – a real need, and start thinking about profitability earlier than their Western counterparts. The convergence between increasing digitalization and a growing, more demanding middle class gives founders in these places opportunities to explore.
This last point is vindicated by Nubank. The Brazilian fintech firm disrupted Latin America’s banking sector, riding the wave of the middle class’s desire for more advanced, digital financial products.
Since going public in 2021, Nubank has delivered solid growth. Its future potential stands at the nexus of Latin America’s large potential user base and the plethora of financial services it plans to roll out. The firm expanded regionally but seemingly did so with healthy unit economics.
As VC industries in emerging markets mature, one could reasonably infer that they will become inclined to optimize themselves. After all, the VC scene in the West developed the unicorn factory system partly to standardize and professionalize a formerly niche industry.
Avoiding such a fate starts with continuing to scrutinize unit economics. Standardizing the industry isn’t bad, as long as every investor in the chain isn’t practicing willful ignorance about companies’ business fundamentals.
Crypto’s potential
At both the Stellar Development Foundation and Next Billion Advisors, my work has reinforced my belief in cryptocurrency’s potentially game-changing impact, notably for emerging market startups.
The majority of the early successes in emerging markets were fintech startups. And as embedded fintech gains prominence, the way such startups handle money is front and center. In many aspects, it is still a nightmare.
Cross-border payments are expensive, unpredictable inflation can put fragile startups under strain, and processing the continuous stream of new payment methods all represent challenges.
The infrastructure on which crypto is built can assuage some of these pains. Simply put: Cryptocurrencies enable a user to send traceable value over the internet, making the process of sending money to someone across the globe as fast and cheap as sending an email.
Crypto’s elementary, tangible potential for transforming the global financial scene has been overshadowed by scores of damaging speculative use cases and a polluted secondary market. As the bad actors recede and go to jail in some cases, crypto’s less flashy but more useful use cases will retake center stage.
Developments in recent years are strengthening crypto’s real-world usability.
Stablecoins – cryptocurrencies that mirror a fiat currency – are becoming more reliable. The so-called “on and off-ramps” – processes used to convert fiat to crypto and vice versa – increase its ubiquity and ease of use.

The progress is more than theoretical: Mexico-based FelixPago has built its cross-border payment and remittance product using the Stellar network’s crypto rails in the background. Crypto’s ability to facilitate faster transactions and to lower costs compared to legacy financial infrastructure is unparalleled.
But to usher in widespread market adoption, crypto’s usability needs to be refined. If a technology works but isn’t usable, then it isn’t ready to be broadly adopted.
What’s viewed as the “last frontier” here is people’s ability to spend the cryptocurrency sent to them. That remains a challenge in most places.
In that aspect, MoneyGram’s onboarding to the Stellar network is encouraging. The legacy remittance behemoth has a truly global and physical presence through its network of agents, who are charged with disbursing customers’ cash to recipients.
By joining the Stellar network, MoneyGram “fills” that last frontier: People can send money via crypto rails and easily convert it to cash through a MoneyGram agent.
At the crossroads
Emerging markets are at an exciting juncture, where the growing middle class’s needs are being filled by innovative, homegrown startups. Fintech firms that optimize the management of this newfound buying power are uniquely positioned, as they represent both society-altering potential and strong investment cases.
Venture capital and crypto, two important actors in the advent of fintech in emerging markets, are facing a reckoning in the West. The VC sector has entered an existential crisis fueled by years of reckless and unimaginative investing, while crypto is coming to terms with its fraudulent first generation.
Founders and investors elsewhere have the benefit of watching this unfold from afar and can internalize the lessons needed to avoid such a fate. In short: Keep venture capital imaginative but exigent, and focus on real-world crypto usability rather than niche, theoretical applications.
Financially tooling the “next billion” using lessons from my time in Silicon Valley has been my life’s work. The best advice I can give is to learn from our mistakes.
Mark Heynen has led go-to-market in emerging markets for large and small companies, from Google’s initial push into maps in the mid-200s to Facebook’s early mobile efforts. He also co-founded PayJoy, a Silicon Valley-based fintech startup operating in 20 countries.

Singapore’s Land Transport Authority has allowed local bike-sharing company Anywheel to add another 5,000 units to its fleet, pushing its total to 35,000.
This extends Anywheel’s lead as Singapore’s largest bike-sharing company in terms of fleet size, years after the first wave’s dominant players fizzled. Its closest competitor, Alibaba-backed HelloRide, operates 10,000 bikes per a license secured last year.
Meanwhile, SG Bike was approved to operate 1,500 shared bikes, but the company ceased operations last month. Following the closure, users were allowed to convert their existing credits for use in Anywheel’s platform.
Founded in 2017 by Htay Aung, Anywheel provides first-mile and last-mile transportation options. In an earlier interview with Tech in Asia, Aung said that the company has been net profitable since February 2023.
Aside from its bike-sharing services, where it charges less than US$1 for a 30-minute ride, the firm generates revenue from advertising.
Anywheel’s next bike rollout will feature new smart locks, a response to customer worries about theft risks. This feature lets customers lock and unlock bikes through the app, removing the need for manual locks.

846599,2024-05-02T01:55:40,2024-05-20T09:31:20,Shopee’s mimicry of TikTok Shop is starting to pay off,shopee-ramps-shortvideo-efforts-fend-tiktok-shop,publish,post,https://www.techinasia.com/shopee-ramps-shortvideo-efforts-fend-tiktok-shop,"It used to be that you could only find short-form videos – from life hacks, social commentaries, to funny clips – on TikTok. These days, they are also emerging on Shopee.
The change – meant to draw more content creators and organic traffic onto the platform – is part of Shopee’s recent efforts to counter TikTok Shop’s rapid growth in Southeast Asia.

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Shopee isn’t alone. Other ecommerce players, like Lazada and Tokopedia, are also working to replicate TikTok’s social media formula to attract new types of consumers, especially those who engage in video commerce and are impulsive buyers. This is also an attempt to lure in new sellers.
In 2022, Shopee launched a channel called “Video” for its short-form video content in Indonesia, which features prominently on its landing page. The feature has since expanded to users in Vietnam, the Philippines, Thailand, and Malaysia.
Similarly, Lazada introduced a “Like” tab on its app last year featuring short-form video content, which is available in all of its markets except Singapore. Users of Tokopedia in Indonesia can also access short videos through the “Feed” tab on the platform.
Like on TikTok, sellers and creators on ecommerce marketplaces can promote products via short videos. Shoppers can purchase the products in these videos by clicking on links that direct them to a checkout page.

Short-form videos on TikTok, Shopee, Lazada, and Tokopedia

Will social commerce and short-video commerce features be the key for ecommerce platforms like Shopee and Lazada to successfully fend off TikTok Shop’s rising popularity in Southeast Asia?
If the answer is yes, the feat likely won’t be easy. The vast number of TikTok users – 325 million in Southeast Asia – are on the app for entertainment, so discovering and shopping for products is secondary. In contrast, most users of ecommerce apps already have purchase intent.
Drawing new customers and sellers
At the moment, Shopee appears to be the most aggressive in pushing short-form videos and live-shopping features. This includes Shopee Live, which it first introduced in 2018.
In Indonesia, Shopee currently offers discounts of as much as 20%, as well as free shipping, for purchases that are done via Shopee Video. In contrast, Lazada and Tokopedia aren’t offering any such promotions for their short-video channels.
Shopee is hoping efforts like short videos, which “appeal to buyers across all age groups,” can draw in and retain young customers, Ian Ho, vice president at Shopee, tells Tech in Asia. Gen Z shoppers – those 24 years old and below – make up 33% of buyers on the platform, he adds.
The company’s aggressiveness seems to be paying off. Shopee Video’s daily viewership in Southeast Asia has tripled since March 2023, according to the firm. The number of daily unique buyers on the channel in March was also 24x higher compared to March 2023.
In Indonesia, orders on Shopee Video rose by almost 30x year on year during the same period, as more users shopped while watching short videos.

Meanwhile, consumers can avail of discounts when making purchases on Shopee Live at any time – not only during shopping events. Last December, 15% of Shopee’s physical order volume in Southeast Asia came from livestreaming.
Building a content ecosystem
Latif Sim, chief strategy officer of BeLive, a Singapore-based live- and video-commerce enabler, tells Tech in Asia that videos allow for a better demonstration of items than images or text alone. This is because they “can show products in use, which helps reduce uncertainty about the product’s features and benefits.”
This is particularly important for goods such as cosmetics, apparel, and gadgets, which are often brought to life with demonstrations. This is in line with data from insights firm Cube Asia in August 2023, which showed that beauty and fashion were the top two best-selling categories on TikTok Shop.
On Tokopedia, meanwhile, the most popular categories in livestreaming and short video in 2023 were food and beverage, beauty, personal care, health, and fashion, according to a company spokesperson.
Adding social media elements to an ecommerce marketplace, however, might not be as straightforward as it seems.
“Shopee and Lazada are not entertainment platforms and do not necessarily understand users’ content preferences in the same way as TikTok,” says Jacob Cooke, co-founder and CEO of global digital marketing agency WPIC Marketing + Technologies. He notes that because of this, the ecommerce firms may not make video recommendations that are as accurate.

To attract more users, ecommerce companies will need to increase the number and variety of videos, notes a Tokopedia executive, who requested to remain anonymous.
Already, Shopee and Lazada are welcoming sellers, users, content creators, and affiliates to upload various types of videos, even those that aren’t promoting products. Should Shopee successfully draw enough creators and affiliates on the platform, this will – in theory – create a self-sustaining content library, without the need for incentives.
Over the past few years, Shopee has been running an affiliate program, where everyday users can promote products from the platform on social media to earn commissions from sales. Now, these affiliates can also create content on Shopee Video.
According to its seller guide website, Shopee now has more than 250,000 affiliates in Indonesia, which include local celebrities such as Fuji Utami, Tasya Farasya, and Sharena Delon.

Based on Tech in Asia‘s observations, the content libraries of both Shopee and Lazada now include funny videos, life hacks, tips, and more – types of content that used to only be found on social media platforms.
Shopee’s Ho points out that Shopee Video’s strong growth over the past year was “driven by both an increase in demand and supply of videos” on the platform.
Ultimately, it’s the quality of content creators that will play a decisive role in the success of video commerce. In a survey by Cube Asia, which was conducted between January to March 2023, 31% of almost 2,000 respondents in Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines said they shopped on TikTok because their favorite influencers were on the platform.
And, while live selling can be effective in driving sales over the short run, short videos can become “permanent assets” that reach more users and which can be consumed repeatedly, driving more sales over time, BeLive’s Sim notes.
Hitting back
The temporary closure of TikTok Shop In Indonesia between October to November last year has provided some leeway for Shopee to strike back.
During last year’s 12.12 shopping sale, Shopee Indonesia reported a 45x increase in transactions on Shopee Video compared to its sales in a regular day.
Several consumers tell Tech in Asia that they have been using TikTok Shop less frequently after the platform merged with Tokopedia in December.
Nadya Pramitha, a homemaker residing in Jakarta, says that the discounts offered by TikTok Shop after the merger are not as significant as before, so she switched to Shopee Live and Video.
Another homemaker, Annisha Fathullah Jay, echoes the sentiment about discounts and said she now feels more accustomed to watching video content on Shopee.

WPIC’s Cooke believes it will take time for Shopee users to get used to new features like short videos on the platform. There are also questions on whether giving out discounts on Shopee Video and Shopee Live is sustainable.
Sea’s financials remained in the red in the fourth quarter of 2023 after hitting net profit for three consecutive quarters from Q4 2022 to Q2 2023.
That said, Sea Group CEO Forrest Li has spoken publicly about the company’s commitment to the live- and video-commerce sector.
“We will deepen and broaden engagement with creators, sellers, and partners across the content ecosystem and better integrate livestreaming and short-form video into the shopping experience,” he said on the firm’s fourth quarter earnings call.
Yücel Yelken, founder and CEO of the global market research firm yStats, believes that video commerce will be a “key aspect” for the future consumer’s buying journey even if its direct impact on profitability “may not be immediately evident.”
“Video or content commerce plays a crucial role in shaping consumer behavior, driving engagement, and building brand loyalty over time,” Yelken tells Tech in Asia.

Will consumers continue to watch short videos and livestreams on Shopee even after discounts end?
Pramitha and Jay, both Shopee and TikTok users in Indonesia, say the absence of discounts won’t deter them from watching reviews of the items they are interested in.
In the short-term, however, discount wars are likely to continue, with TikTok Shop also dishing out generous shopping vouchers to drive sales. That said, ecommerce platforms are unlikely to remove these features even if they do not work out.

Bernard Leong, founder of Dorje AI / Photo credit: Bernard Leong’s website

Bernard Leong, a Singapore-based angel investor who was previously an AI executive at Amazon Web Services (AWS), has launched a startup. Called Dorje AI, the company aims to build a financial enterprise resource planning (ERP) system powered by AI.
The idea behind the company comes from Leong’s experiences of “dealing painfully with glorified ERP systems,” he said in a LinkedIn post.
An ERP system acts as a backbone for a business, helping companies run tasks in areas like human resources, accounting, and marketing. Some of the major operators in the space include SAP and Oracle.
While it can make operations more fluid, factors like buggy software, a lack of training for employees, and steep prices often make businesses turn away from ERP.
“The vision of Dorje AI is to create the next generation open business operating systems to enable companies to be optimally efficient, productive, and continuously adaptive.”
In addition, the venture aims to address how data gets locked in closed ERP systems, which often impedes medium-to-large companies from using AI. The name “Dorje” is a Buddhist term meaning “indestructible” and “powerful transformation,” Leong explained.
Aside from angel investing, Leong has a long corporate career that includes stints at companies like Singapore Post and Airbus. He spent over two years at AWS, serving as the head of machine learning and artificial intelligence for ASEAN.
Leong also runs the Analyse Asia podcast series and was co-founder of pioneering tech blog SGEntrepreneurs, which Tech in Asia acquired in 2013.
Dorje AI is in the product testing phase but is accepting waitlist signups on its website, Leong said on his LinkedIn post.

Twitch, the Amazon-owned livestreaming giant, has launched a TikTok-like feature called Discovery Feed, Bloomberg reported. This comes just days after the US passed a bill that would ban the Chinese short-video app unless sold.
Unlike traditional Twitch livestreams, which focus on long gaming or vlogging sessions, Discovery Feed shows users brief highlights from these lengthy videos. That also makes it distinct from TikTok’s short videos, as Discovery Feed uses content from existing streams.
Social media platforms have long copied successful elements from their rivals. In 2022, TikTok started a Twitch-like subscription livestreaming feature, though the report noted that Twitch’s market position was not significantly affected.
Similarly, it may take time until Twitch’s offering can go head-to-head against TikTok, which has 170 million users in the US. That might change, however: TikTok parent ByteDance reportedly prefers shutting down its US app rather than selling it to another party.
Still, doing so would minimally affect ByteDance, which has recently outpaced fellow Chinese titan Tencent in terms of revenue. As popular as TikTok is in the US, its daily active users account for just 5% of ByteDance’s global daily active users.

Hello reader,
Most of the time when I visit home in Northern Ireland, it amazes me how little has changed about the place.
It often feels like stepping back in time to when I was in my early 20s when I last lived there, with the same people doing the same things in the same places. But one thing that seems to be different every time is the increasingly visible adoption of new technology.
On my last trip over Christmas 2023, it was a robot waiter in a cafe at Belfast International Airport that shocked me. The strange little device whirred about the busy cafe, bringing plates back and forth from the counter.
No one else seemed all that interested in the machine, which perhaps hints at how increasingly common it is to see this tech in some places. No wonder then that Singaporean companies are trying to capitalize on the expected growth of the service robotics industry, as today’s featured story explores.
Today we look at:

Singapore seeking to carve out a niche in service robotics
The US$53 million gross revenue of global micromobility firm Beam
Other newsy highlights such as GoTo Group posting a loss of US$6.2 million in adjusted EBITDA in Q1, while fellow Indonesian player Bukalapak scores a profit of US$922,500.

Robot at your service

For years, robots in the workplace have typically been found on factory floors in environments where conditions are fixed and controlled.
That’s changing as service robots are expected to take an increasingly large position in the robotics market, and Singaporean companies are positioning themselves to cash in.


Branching out: According to research from the International Federation of Robotics, Singapore had the second-highest industrial robot density in the world in 2022, with 730 robots for every 10,000 employees, mostly in manufacturing. This excellence in robotics has set the stage for companies in the sector to explore other areas, such as the service industry. One example is LionsBot, which has sold over 2,500 of its made-in-Singapore professional cleaning robots to buyers in 30 countries.

Challenges remain: While there is optimism about the future of the service robotics industry, the tech’s effectiveness is still dependent on their physical environment and the willingness of companies to adopt the technology. William Dai, founder of robot distributor Ourglass Robotics, said that of 100 restaurants evaluating using robots, only one or two would pull the purchase trigger. Factors such as the layout of their restaurants, willingness to pay for the tech, as well as issues related to workflow, grants, and internal resistance would all be factors putting some off.

AI’s role: As the industry develops, players are thinking more deeply about the intersection between real-world environments, hardware, and software. Robots from different manufacturers will need to communicate with each other, as well as with the tech in the various building facilities they are placed in. Players in the city-state are exploring the use of AI in tackling these challenges, but it may still be years before efficiency is reached.

Beam me up, Scotty

Global micromobility firm Beam said its gross revenue surged 36% year on year in 2023, hitting US$53 million.
The company said this was driven by increased demand for its e-scooters and e-bikes.


Costs slashed: Beam cut its group expenses by 25% in 2023, which helped it reach EBITDA profitability in the latter half of the year. Alan Jiang, CEO of Beam, told Tech in Asia that the firm had seen an uptick in commuter usage, particularly in Australia, New Zealand, and South Korea.

Home away from home: The company operates in more than 130 cities across eight countries, namely Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, and Turkey. However, it is currently not active in its home country of Singapore – something Jiang hopes to change.

Eyes on the prize: While Beam is interested in exploring partnerships in Singapore, the immediate focus is profitability, Jiang said. This means “launching our services in countries that already have existing micromobility programs for e-scooters and e-bikes in place,” he said, adding that Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, and Turkey are the current target markets.

Global Digital Niaga, the holding company of Indonesian tech majors Blibli and Tiket, recorded US$241.2 million in net revenues for the first quarter of 2024, a 2% year-on-year growth.
Meanwhile, its EBITDA losses improved 30% year over year to US$35.1 million during the quarter. Its losses from operations similarly improved by 29% to US$38.4 million.
The company attributed the growth to its focus on categories with higher margins and faster turnover.
“In the first quarter of this year, general consumer spending was soft,” said Kusumo Martanto, CEO and co-founder of Blibli. “Our B2C navigated it through categories selective growth strategy, including further expansion of our physical customer touchpoints to strengthen our omnichannel approach.”
Part of the growth came from Tiket, its online travel agent (OTA) business, which benefited from a surge during Ramadan, a period in which Indonesians typically return to their hometowns. However, the boost was slightly offset by Blibli’s optimization initiatives for its B2C retail segment.
Take rates also rose to 6.3% from 4.9% in Q1 2023. This helped Blibli’s gross profit before discounts climb 29% year on year. Total operating costs as a share of rotal payment volume dropped from 8.1% in Q1 2023 to 7.7% in Q1 2024 – a result of various cost-cutting strategies, the company noted.
Founded in 2010, Blibli offers an ecommerce platform complemented by physical stores. It launched six more offline electronics stores in Q1 2024, raising the total to 172, while also running 63 locations of the Ranch Market premium supermarket chain.
Blibli ventured into the OTA space in 2017 by acquiring Tiket before adding fresh produce and groceries through its 2021 Ranch Market buy. It went public on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) in late 2022.
As of yesterday’s market close, Blibli shares traded at 472 rupiah (US$0.03), substantially higher than fellow IDX-listed tech giants GoTo and Bukalapak.
Currency converted from rupiah to US dollar: US$1 = 16,255 rupiah.

Eight US newspapers, including the New York Daily News, Chicago Tribune, and Denver Post, have sued OpenAI and Microsoft, alleging that the tech giants have used copyrighted articles to train AI chatbots without securing approval or paying fees.
This is yet another copyright-related lawsuit for OpenAI. The New York Times filed a similar case in December 2023, as have fiction and nonfiction authors including George R.R. Martin, whose work was adapted into the Game of Thrones television series.
“We’ve spent billions of dollars gathering information and reporting news at our publications, and we can’t allow OpenAI and Microsoft to expand the Big Tech playbook of stealing our work to build their own businesses at our expense,” said Frank Pine, executive editor for the MediaNews Group and Tribune Publishing, whose newspapers are part of the suit.
All eight claimants share an owner in Alden Global Capital, a New York-based hedge fund.
For its part, OpenAI has since worked out licensing deals with publishing companies like Axel Springer, which owns Politico and Business Insider, as well as the Financial Times and the Associated Press.
However, battles like this have gone beyond Manhattan courtrooms and into places like Singapore. Authors in the city-state have aired grievances over a Southeast Asia-focused large language model spearheaded by the Singapore government.

Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, the ex-CEO of crypto trading platform Binance, will serve a four-month prison term after pleading guilty to breaking US anti-money laundering rules, Reuters reported. This is shorter than the three-year period US prosecutors had proposed in April.
Binance was accused of not reporting more than 100,000 dubious transactions involving recognized terrorist groups like Hamas, al-Qaeda, and Islamic State. The prosecutors also claimed that Binance helped facilitate the sale of child exploitation materials.
“I’m sorry,” Zhao told US District Judge Richard Jones before his sentencing in Seattle. “I believe the first step of taking responsibility is to fully recognize the mistakes. Here I failed to implement an adequate anti-money laundering program.”
The court also imposed a US$4.32 billion penalty on Binance. Apart from serving his prison sentence, Zhao is expected to pay a US$50 million criminal fine and another US$50 million to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
Judge Jones took Zhao to task for prioritizing Binance’s growth over legal compliance, despite having “the wherewithal, the finance capabilities, and the people power to make sure that every single regulation had to be complied with.”
Zhao’s legal woes have led to a tumultuous time at the company he founded in 2017. The Philippines banned Binance in late March. A month after that, the exchange appointed a board for the first time.

Traveloka , the Indonesia-based travel tech giant, has cleared its US$300 million private credit loan, sources briefed on the matter told Bloomberg. The payback went to a lender group that includes BlackRock, Orion Capital Asia, and Allianz Global Investors, as well as sovereign wealth fund Indonesia Investment Authority.
Traveloka took the loan in 2022 with a 2026 repayment plan. At the time, it said the funds would strengthen its balance sheet as the travel industry bounces back from Covid-19.
The company had withdrawn only US$250 million of the agreed US$300 million loan amount. Traveloka opted to use its own cash reserves for repayment.
This comes amid a post-pandemic resurgence in the travel industry, with airlines notably recording high revenues in 2023. By late 2022, the company had shut down initiatives aimed at riding out the pandemic: on-demand logistics service Traveloka Send and food delivery platform Traveloka Eats.
The firm also conducted silent layoffs in early 2023 following its COO’s departure. This appeared to be part of Traveloka’s reprioritization of its core verticals.
In 2022, Traveloka generated US$225.9 million in revenue, a 75% jump compared to the previous year. Its losses for the period also improved to US$98.2 million from US$138.2 million in 2021.

Dhianendra Laksmana has resigned from his position as CFO of Indonesian aquaculture unicorn eFishery.
“His decision to resign is due to personal reasons and preferences, and eFishery expresses gratitude for his contributions in helping to grow eFishery,” a company spokesperson told Tech in Asia.
Group CEO Gibran Huzaifah will fill Laksmana’s role as interim CFO, the person added.
During his time at eFishery, Laksmana spearheaded initiatives that expanded the company’s financial reach and operational capabilities.
Notably, in March 2024, he played a key role in the collaboration between eFishery and Amar Bank. This partnership was designed to enhance financial access for fish farmers, enabling them to develop and expand their businesses more effectively.
The management shuffle comes at a time of expansion for eFishery. Earlier this year, the company acquihired DycodeX, a local AI-powered IoT startup. This deal aims to bolster eFishery’s AI plans, which include the launch of a new brand, eFishery.ai.
The company also launched commercial operations in India late last year to capture part of the South Asian country’s US$15 billion aquaculture industry.
This geographical expansion followed eFishery’s US$200 million series D round in July 2023, which bumped up its valuation to US$1.4 billion and made it the world’s first aquaculture unicorn.

Gaming lifestyle brand Razer has been ordered to refund over US$1.1 million to its US customers following allegations that it falsely advertised its Zephyr masks as N95-grade, Channel News Asia reported.
Additionally, Razer is required to pay a US$100,000 penalty. The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) accused Razer of marketing these masks as N95-grade without undergoing the necessary testing and certifications from the country’s Food and Drug Administration and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.
A Razer representative, however, told CNA that the company rejects the FTC’s claims. The person added that while Razer did not intend to mislead its customers, “we chose to settle this matter to avoid the distraction and disruption of litigation and continue our focus on creating great products for gamers.”
These masks were sold for US$100 each, with Razer recommending users replace the filters every three days. Razer’s spokesperson added that “more than two years ago,” the company had let customers know that the Zephyr mask was not N95-grade, discontinued sales, and gave refunds to buyers.
This was not Razer’s only mask-related initiative during the Covid-19 pandemic. The company previously set up vending machines for surgical masks in Singapore. It also planned to give away one free surgical mask to every Singaporean adult at the time.
Meanwhile, Razer recently announced that its fintech arm Razer Fintech had been renamed to Fiuu. The rebranding followed the company’s recent partnership with Philippines-based BillEase, which provides buy now, pay later services.

Bank Neo Commerce (BNC), an Indonesia-based digital bank, has appointed Eri Budiono as its new CEO, following the resignation of Tjandra Gunawan in June 2023. The announcement was made during the company’s general shareholders meeting today.
After Gunawan’s exit last year, the CEO role was temporarily filled by Aditya Wahyu Windarwo, who was also the bank’s chief business officer.
Budiono previously served as the head of commercial banking at HSBC and global banking director of Maybank Indonesia. Before being named as CEO of BNC, Budiono was the CEO of Jakarta-based greentech firm TerraThrive.
BNC also announced the appointment of Kreisna Dewantara Gozali as the company’s new commissioner. Gozali is the CEO of Indonesian plantation firm Gozco.
Their appointments will take effect after obtaining approval from the Financial Services Authority following a fit-and-proper test, which the government agency does on execs set to overlook operations of companies that cover areas like insurance, pension funds, and financing.
BNC said that it had around 26 million users as of March 2024. Last year, it disbursed loans totaling 10.8 trillion rupiah (US$663 million), slightly up from US$630 million in 2022.
Meanwhile, the company’s losses in 2023 amounted to US$35.2 million, an improvement of 27% compared to the previous year.
Competition among digital banks in Indonesia has become increasingly intense with the emergence of new players. Most recently, Grab and Singtel-backed Superbank launched its first consumer-focused product, a savings feature that offers an interest rate of 10% per annum.

Foodpanda, an Asia-focused food delivery and e-grocery platform, has launched a new private-label selection called “Bright,” which is available on its online grocery shop Pandamart.
The private label offers 1,000 products split into three sub-brands: Brightfarms for fresh produce, Brightyums for pantry staples and ready-to-eat meals, and Brightspots for household essentials.
Bright items will be available in all Pandamart stores across its markets, with Singapore and Malaysia initially having the most extensive range of products.
Raphael Zennou, Foodpanda’s vice president of quick commerce, said that the new label allows the firm to have better quality control over products on Pandamart.
According to Foodpanda, direct procurement with suppliers makes Bright products more cost-effective as well, potentially allowing customers to save 25% compared to products from outside sources. This move fits into Foodpanda’s objective to target price-sensitive customers, the company said.
In 2021, Foodpanda launched an in-house brand, Brightfields, offering a limited selection of pantry needs, including eggs, tissue paper, and mineral water. It has since widened the product line to include more items, such as fresh fruits and cleaning products.
The expansion comes after Foodpanda parent firm Delivery Hero ended talks to divest Foodpanda in select Southeast Asian markets. Grab was reportedly one of the potential buyers for the food delivery brand.

California-based PsiQuantum has announced plans to build the world’s first commercial quantum computer in Brisbane, Australia.
The Temasek-backed quantum computing startup said today that it has secured US$620 million worth of funding from the Australian and Queensland governments, with a target to build a commercial quantum computer by 2077.
PsiQuantum will build a utility-scale quantum computer, which is capable of error correction, allowing it to complete billions of computational steps. Without this capability, quantum computers cannot perform more than a dozen or so computational steps without errors introduced by quantum noise.
“A utility-scale quantum computer represents an opportunity to construct a new, practical foundation of computational infrastructure, and in so doing ignite the next industrial revolution,” said Jeremy O’Brien, PsiQuantum’s CEO.
Building the first commercially available quantum computer will involve building increasingly larger and more sophisticated systems ahead of the 2077 target launch.
O’Brien likens the task to constructing a small data center or high-performance computer, with racks of equipment being connected together. Like data centers, quantum computers need cooling on an industrial level.

“Each of these cabinets contains hundreds of silicon chips – half of them are photonic, half of them electronic. They’re all wired up electrically together, interconnected optically using conventional telecommunication fibres,” said O’Brien.
PsiQuantum chose Brisbane as the project site due to its connection with the locale – its photonics approach was conceived in its laboratory there, as well as in Los Alamos, New Mexico in the US.
O’Brien also cited the location’s highly educated and skilled workforce, adding that Australia is “blessed with natural resources of sun, wind, and space.” This is relevant to one of quantum computing’s “hugely significant” application domains, which is climate change.
Temasek’s investment in PsiQuantum represents its interest in emerging technologies that could play a role in enabling innovation and creating economic value. Quantum computing could also bring about the unattainable category of computer-generated data to train AI models, noted Russell Tham, head of emerging technologies at Temasek.
“This form of computing at utility-scale – that can operate without errors – will unleash a new wave of innovation in material science, drug discovery, logistics, and many other fields,” he said.

Hello reader,
Court is somewhere no one wants a conflict between two founders to end up, unless you’re a lawyer perhaps.
Apart from the obvious sadness those involved must feel for being unable to resolve the issue themselves, I think the authority of a judicial ruling has to weigh heavily. If an outside party with that level of authority rules against you, where do you go from here?
I imagine these are some of the thoughts running through U-Zyn Chua’s head these days. The Singapore High Court ruled against the Cake Group co-founder’s attempt to liquidate the crypto firm, which leaves him in a bind.
An appeal could be forthcoming or some other way to resolve the dispute with his fellow co-founder Julian Hosp, but as today’s featured piece explores, the future is far from certain.
Today we look at:

Resolving this dispute is no piece of cake

There’s been another turn in the Cake Group drama, as the Singapore High Court dismissed the winding-up application filed by U-Zyn Chua.
The court said that the crypto firm’s co-founder and former CTO “has gone too far” with the move.


Denied: Judicial Commissioner Alex Wong ruled that there were no grounds for shuttering the firm and added that it was inappropriate for Chua to seek liquidation when selling his shares is still an option to exit the company. The legal conflict between Chua and his fellow co-founder and CEO Julian Hosp began in December last year, though the two first fell out in October 2023 over disagreements about the layoffs at Cake Group.

Back to square one: Chua told Tech in Asia that the ruling came as a surprise to him and said working with Hosp was still not an option. “We definitely can’t work with each other anymore. We mutually agreed last September that one of us has to leave,” he added.

What now?: In a previous hearing on February 28, Hosp offered to sell his stake in the firm to Chua as a way to resolve the acrimony, but the deal failed to materialize. Chua said that he and Hosp had also discussed the latter buying Chua out, to no success. “We’ve tried so many times, but [our attempts] kept failing in the past six months,” he said.

News spotlight
A man must have a code

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Abnk, Atome, Grab, and SeaMoney have all received TrustMark accreditations from the Singapore FinTech Association (SFA) and the BNPL Working Group.
This means all four have committed to meeting the guidelines in the buy now, pay later code of conduct (BNPL code), said the SFA.


Joint effort: The SFA and the working group (which includes Atome, Grab Financial Group, and ShopBack) have been working on the BNPL code since 2022 in a bid to protect customers from issues like overindebtedness.

Nuts and bolts: Per the code, accredited BNPL players will not allow customers to rack up S$2,000 (US$1,470) in outstanding payments, unless they apply for an additional assessment. It includes other safeguards like a requirement to offer financial hardship assistance to customers in need.

Another set of eyes: PricewaterhouseCoopers carried out an independent assessment of the four players prior to them receiving the accreditation, according to the SFA.

After Indonesia-based DailySocial.id laid off all of its staff as part of a major restructuring, the company has since transferred its operations to a new entity, DiscoveryShift, led by Rama Mamuaya – the startup-focused news platform’s founder and CEO.
DiscoveryShift said in a statement that its offerings range from strategy development to operational implementation. It also offers corporate venture capital services, helping companies establish their own venture-building units and identify opportunities for investment.
The firm aims to do so by using AI. This will involve optimizing the business processes of its clients with AI, and building AI talent within their organizations.
The company said that it is supporting “top-tier clients” and has experts in enterprise AI, machine learning, automation, and digital transformation on its team.
According to DiscoveryShift’s website, it has 112 clients consisting of local and multinational corporations, startups, and SMEs. While based in Indonesia, the company also has an office in Singapore.
“Through DiscoveryShift, we are enhancing our ability to empower businesses to realize their full potential through AI and digital innovation,” said Mamuaya.
Before its major layoffs earlier this month, DailySocial.id had job cuts in August 2023, affecting 18 employees. This was months after the company launched DS/X Ventures, an investment division dedicated to early-stage enterprises.

Thai foodtech company Betagro has launched its corporate venture arm Betagro Ventures, which covers both venture capital investments and venture building activities for the firm.
The VC arm will focus on projects that tackle consumer access to safe and high-quality foods, support green protein sources, and create green agrifood supply chains.
To aid these projects, Betagro Ventures has created a US$30 million venture fund focusing on early-stage foodtech and agritech startups.
In addition to financial backing, the fund will provide chosen startups access to the Betagro network, which lets them tap into the company’s industry knowledge and opens them up for potential partnerships.
“Betagro Ventures will be a key mechanism in propelling Betagro’s businesses into a new era of sustainable growth,” said Chayadhorn Taepaisitphongse, chief strategy and innovation officer of Betagro and managing director of Betagro Ventures, in a statement.
As a group, Betagro had invested in startups such as Thai agritech firm FreshKet in 2022 and Hamburg-based alternative meat firm Infinite Roots in January 2024.
According to a report from Boston Consulting Group, Thailand is home to the smallest number of startups among Southeast Asian countries. Yet, the nation is the region’s second-largest economy in terms of gross domestic product.

Ola Cabs is looking to cut about 180 of its workforce – or 10% of its total – as part of a restructuring effort that would also mark CEO Hemant Bakshi‘s exit from the India-based firm just a few months into his term.













Bakshi left the company due to disagreements on team-building approaches for the next fiscal year, The Arc reported.
As per the report, Bakshi favored an operations-led strategy to expand Ola’s business, whereas founder Bhavish Aggarwal pushed for a tech-centric focus.













Aggarwal will take over Bakshi’s daily tasks and retain his chairman and managing director roles.
Notably, the ride-hailing firm is working toward a US$500 million financial debut. Ahead of the listing, Ola exited from the UK, New Zealand, and Australia to focus on its home market.
For the financial year ending March 2023, Ola recorded sales of US$337.1 million and a loss of US$93 million. Its ride-hailing segment reduced its losses by 65% year on year to US$130.3 million.
The company is also expanding its reach to newer business lines. Earlier this year, it launched Krutrim AI, which debuted its own large language model.

Tech giant Microsoft has announced plans to invest US$1.7 billion over the next four years in new cloud and AI infrastructure in Indonesia.
The company said that this marks the “single largest investment in Microsoft’s 29-year history in the country.” The company will also facilitate AI skills training for 840,000 Indonesians.
“This new generation of AI is reshaping how people live and work everywhere, including in Indonesia,” Satya Nadella, chairman and CEO of Microsoft, said in a statement.
“The investments we are announcing today – spanning digital infrastructure, skilling, and support for developers – will help Indonesia thrive in this new era,” he added.
Alongside the investment announcement, Nadella visited Indonesia President Joko Widodo in Jakarta today. In the meeting, which was also attended by Minister of Communication and Informatics Budi Arie Setiadi, Widodo encouraged Microsoft to establish a research center in the country, local outlet Bisnis reported.
AI is estimated to contribute nearly US$1 trillion to Southeast Asia’s gross domestic product by 2030, with Indonesia poised to capture US$366 billion of that figure, according to research by Kearney.
Meanwhile, Microsoft also announced that it will provide AI training and support to 2.5 million people in Southeast Asia by 2025. To do so, the company plans to partner with governments, communities, and non-profit and corporate organizations across the region.

GoTo Group has announced that it will deconsolidate its logistics unit associated with Tokopedia in the second quarter of this year. This comes after the Indonesian tech giant completed the ecommerce partnership of TikTok Shop and Tokopedia on January 31.
“We have entered into a conditional sale and purchase agreement to divest ownership of the delivery and fulfillment businesses and the GoTo Logistics that support Tokopedia,” said GoTo CFO Jacky Lo during the company’s Q1 2024 earnings call.
“Upon closing of these transactions, GoTo Logistics will be deconsolidated from the group,” he added.
Following the divestment, the logistics unit will return under Tokopedia. GoTo previously acquired 99.8% shares of Swift Logistics Solutions, Tokopedia’s logistics unit, in January 2023.
Meanwhile, GoTo made sure its B2B delivery business will stay with the group, as well as its on-demand delivery unit GoSend. Therefore, the group has stopped reporting financials from GoTo Logistics as a segment starting from Q1 2024.
This decision marks GoTo’s latest divestiture of a business unit. In August 2023, the company sold its entertainment business GoPlay and Loket – the ticketing platform that operates the group’s GoTix offering – to former executives.
For Q1 2024, GoTo recorded an 89% year-on-year improvement in adjusted EBITDA with an adjusted loss of US$6.2 million. It said it remains on track to hit adjusted EBITDA profitability for the full year of 2024.

Livestreaming company 17Live reported a 26% year-on-year rise in adjusted EBITDA to US$20 million for 2023 on the back of strong operating income.
This is the first annual earnings reported by the company after its public market debut on Singapore Exchange (SGX) in December last year.

The 37% uptick in operating income was attributed to effective cost discipline and heightened focus on returns on investment. However, revenue for the period fell 23% to US$279 million.
17Live achieved a gross profit of US$115 million in 2023, with gross profit margins improving to 41.2% from 34.7% in the 2022 fiscal year.
A company spokesperson told Tech in Asia that “non-cash valuation loss and one-off IPO-related expenses” affected 17Live’s profitability at the group level.
“Without that non-cash revaluation exercise, we would have been profitable at net income level too,” the person said.
Previously known as M17 Entertainment, 17Live was founded in 2017 through the merger of app developer Paktor Group with livestreaming firm 17 Media. In addition to livestreaming, 17Live operates live commerce services and a social audio platform.
In 2023, Vertex Technology Acquisition Corporation, the special purpose acquisition company affiliated with Singapore’s Vertex Holdings, announced a merger with 17Live, paving the way for its listing on the SGX.
17Live has over 550,000 global monthly active users and nearly 87,000 contract streamers, according to its website. ​​Its app is accessible in over 130 regions.
New revenue streams
17Live’s main revenue source continues to be livestreaming, according to its latest earnings release. The revenue figure for this segment, however, dropped 24% to US$271 million in 2023.

Meanwhile, it witnessed a 34.7% year-on-year increase in revenue from live commerce and other emerging businesses, which reached US$8.1 million. The group’s live commerce offering, OrderPally, posted a doubling of annualized GMV.
“With OrderPally’s success, plans are well underway to further roll out OrderPally across Southeast Asia,” the spokesperson added.
This growth reflects the success of the company’s new revenue streams in live commerce and voice-only livestreaming, according to the company.
17Live develops and provides virtual tokens for users to purchase, which they can gift to livestreamers as a show of support. Additionally, users have the option to join the fan groups of their preferred livestreamers by paying a monthly subscription fee.
The firm also generates revenue from in-app games, where users can use these virtual tokens to play games during livestreaming sessions.
Expenses narrow
The company’s operating expenses declined nearly 13% year on year mainly because of reduced marketing expenses.

According to 17Live, this reflected its “continued focus on cost containment and enhancing operating efficiencies through economies of scale.”
The company recorded a rise of nearly 5x in non-operating expenses to US$258.7 million for FY 2023, compared to US$53 million in FY 2022. This plunge was a result of IPO-related expenses and the revaluation loss on the financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
According to 17Live, these expenses have been largely accounted for in FY 2023 and all future recurrences are not expected to be significant.
The company noted the SGX listing “significantly enhanced balance sheet health.” It held US$102.7 million in cash and cash equivalents for FYE 2023 with no outstanding borrowings.

“Our improved liquidity position allows critical navigation in a rapidly evolving market,” said the company.

Tech in Asia will keep this layoff tracker updated. You can help us maintain this list by sending in any information on job cuts and affected employees. This is the latest version of the article that was previously published on November 15, 2023.
The proverb “all good things must come to an end” seems to aptly describe the current state of startups in Asia. With liquidity drying up, VC funding for startups in the region has been on the decline.
As per a KPMG report, venture capital funding in the Asia-Pacific region declined to US$20.3 billion in the third quarter of 2023, marking the lowest figure since the first quarter of 2017.

This funding shortage has led to over 200,000 pink slips from Asian tech startups.
However, VC funding in Southeast Asia is finally finding its equilibrium with the 2023 seeing only a slight drop compared to the same quarter previous year.
With US$18.2 billion in VC funding, the region experienced a just-over 2% decline in total VC funding in 2023 compared to the US$18.7 billion received in 2022.
Tech in Asia’s data of Southeast Asia funding landscape shows Singapore received a major chunk of funding in the region followed by Indonesia.
Here are the details of the publicly disclosed layoffs that we’ve tracked across Southeast Asia as well as India and China:

This has resulted in an uptick in the number of layoff rounds in India. Third quarter alone witnessed over 2,000 employees being laid off from Indian companies.

The largest layoff in India recently was at ecommerce firm JioMart, which planned to let go of 11,000 employees, and edtechs like Adda 247 and Physicswallah, which reportedly cut around 300 and 120 jobs respectively.
China saw a much lower number of disclosed layoffs than Southeast Asia toward the end of 2023. The regulatory crackdown in the country, which wiped more than US$1 trillion off China’s big tech has came to its end, signaling more stability for the tech industry.
That said, tech giant Binance sacked 1,000 employees in November 2023, majority of whom were from its gaming unit Nuverse.

Binance is one of the only three firms from China who disclosed layoffs.
In total, the number of people affected by layoffs in China in 2023 was much lower that of Southeast Asia and India.
That said, this is there was significantly lower disclosures of layoffs during the year, despite the fact that reports suggest staff cuts continue in the country.

As expected, the startups seeing retrenchments are in their late stages. In China and India, a significant number of post-series C firms have downsized their staff. This is also the case in Southeast Asia. That said, the region has also seen a higher number of layoffs among startups in the series A and B stages.

This is an updated version of the article that was published in January 2023. Since then, we’ve added newly funded players to the list.
After reaching a high in 2022 both in terms of deal value and deal count, funding dropped significantly for Singapore’s fintech industry in 2023.
According to Tech in Asia data, funding into fintech startups in the city-state went down by 35% to US$1.49 billion in 2023 from US$2.31 billion in 2022.
While the number of deals in 2023 matched 2021’s levels, last year’s deal value was still 27% lower.
That said, fintech – alongside other consumer tech platforms like ecommerce – continued to be a top investment choice in Singapore last year, accounting for half of overall startup deal values, according to an Enterprise Singapore report.

The downtrend in funding appears to be extending into 2024 as well, with Tracxn recently reporting that Southeast Asian fintech startups saw a 13% decline in funding for the first quarter of this year, primarily driven by a drop in late-stage investments.
2023 also saw unprofitable firms shut, and others making pivots. Last December, B2B fintech player Bambu shut down after the company failed to hit a profitability goal by year-end, Ned Phillips, founder and CEO of Bambu, told Tech in Asia.
Meanwhile, Grab recently announced plans to discontinue its GrabPay Card offering in June and instead focus efforts on other financial services such as its buy now, pay later (BNPL) and the GrabPay Wallet, which have “much higher adoption.”

Digital banks make moves
In 2023, digital banking majors invested in building out their presence in Singapore. Most of the biggest funding rounds were strategic investments from parent firms into their respective digital banks.
The largest round was Ant Group’s US$188 million injection into Anext Bank. The bank – which services local and regional MSMEs, particularly those dealing with cross-border transactions – received a further US$148 million from its parent firm in March 2024.
Not far behind was Sea Group’s US$172.5 million investment into MariBank. As of February this year, MariBank – which offers savings, business loans, as well as investment products – has crossed S$200 million (US$149 million) in assets under management.
Grab’s also stashed US$101 million into the war chest of GXS Bank, its digibank partnership with telco giant Singtel.
However, the largest round came from insurtech unicorn Bolttech, which raised US$196 million last year from investors like Tokio Marine Holdings and Khazanah Nasional Berhad – the sovereign wealth fund of Malaysia. The company, which followed up with a US$50 million series B extension later in September 2023, said the funds would primarily help it expand its global presence.

Troubles in BNPL
The hype around BNPL appears to be tapering out, with cashback platform ShopBack being the latest to discontinue its PayLater service in Singapore as of March this year.
In 2023, Singapore-based BNPL firm Pace filed for liquidation, citing “liabilities.”
Seemingly bucking this trend, however, is Atome Financial, operator of BNPL service Atome. While it exited the Vietnam BNPL market last July, the company shared earlier this month that its BNPL arm turned EBITDA positive in Q1 2024, as a boost in transactions drove its revenue up by 130% year on year.
Advance Intelligence Group, parent of Atome Financial, also raised US$80 million in May last year, pushing its total raised amount at the time to over US$700 million.

Future potential
2023 also saw a new cross-border payment linkage between Singapore and Malaysia and another with India going live. This brings the total number of live bilateral payment linkages between Singapore and other Asian markets to four.
Aside from being one of the trailblazers in crypto regulation for Southeast Asia, Singapore last year also laid out plans to issue a live central bank digital currency for wholesale settlement – which will set the stage for a tokenized Singapore dollar.

This is an updated version of the article that was published in January 2023. Since then, we’ve added newly funded players to the list.
After reaching a high in 2022 both in terms of deal value and deal count, funding dropped significantly for Singapore’s fintech industry in 2023.
According to Tech in Asia data, funding into fintech startups in the city-state went down by 35% to US$1.49 billion in 2023 from US$2.31 billion in 2022.
While the number of deals in 2023 matched 2021’s levels, last year’s deal value was still 27% lower.
That said, fintech – alongside other consumer tech platforms like ecommerce – continued to be a top investment choice in Singapore last year, accounting for half of overall startup deal values, according to an Enterprise Singapore report.

The downtrend in funding appears to be extending into 2024 as well, with Tracxn recently reporting that Southeast Asian fintech startups saw a 13% decline in funding for the first quarter of this year, primarily driven by a drop in late-stage investments.
2023 also saw unprofitable firms shut, and others making pivots. Last December, B2B fintech player Bambu shut down after the company failed to hit a profitability goal by year-end, Ned Phillips, founder and CEO of Bambu, told Tech in Asia.
Meanwhile, Grab recently announced plans to discontinue its GrabPay Card offering in June and instead focus efforts on other financial services such as its buy now, pay later (BNPL) and the GrabPay Wallet, which have “much higher adoption.”

Digital banks make moves
In 2023, digital banking majors invested in building out their presence in Singapore. Most of the biggest funding rounds were strategic investments from parent firms into their respective digital banks.
The largest round was Ant Group’s US$188 million injection into Anext Bank. The bank – which services local and regional MSMEs, particularly those dealing with cross-border transactions – received a further US$148 million from its parent firm in March 2024.
Not far behind was Sea Group’s US$172.5 million investment into MariBank. As of February this year, MariBank – which offers savings, business loans, as well as investment products – has crossed S$200 million (US$149 million) in assets under management.
Grab’s also stashed US$101 million into the war chest of GXS Bank, its digibank partnership with telco giant Singtel.
However, the largest round came from insurtech unicorn Bolttech, which raised US$196 million last year from investors like Tokio Marine Holdings and Khazanah Nasional Berhad – the sovereign wealth fund of Malaysia. The company, which followed up with a US$50 million series B extension later in September 2023, said the funds would primarily help it expand its global presence.

Troubles in BNPL
The hype around BNPL appears to be tapering out, with cashback platform ShopBack being the latest to discontinue its PayLater service in Singapore as of March this year.
In 2023, Singapore-based BNPL firm Pace filed for liquidation, citing “liabilities.”
Seemingly bucking this trend, however, is Atome Financial, operator of BNPL service Atome. While it exited the Vietnam BNPL market last July, the company shared earlier this month that its BNPL arm turned EBITDA positive in Q1 2024, as a boost in transactions drove its revenue up by 130% year on year.
Advance Intelligence Group, parent of Atome Financial, also raised US$80 million in May last year, pushing its total raised amount at the time to over US$700 million.

Future potential
2023 also saw a new cross-border payment linkage between Singapore and Malaysia and another with India going live. This brings the total number of live bilateral payment linkages between Singapore and other Asian markets to four.
Aside from being one of the trailblazers in crypto regulation for Southeast Asia, Singapore last year also laid out plans to issue a live central bank digital currency for wholesale settlement – which will set the stage for a tokenized Singapore dollar.

With typical check sizes 5x or 6x higher than fintech deals, climate tech startups need more capital than early-stage VCs usually provide.
In addition, private equity firms tend to stay away, as they generally invest in cash flow-positive businesses, and banks find it challenging to finance companies in the industry, as there isn’t sufficient data to underwrite loans.
Today, only 16%  of climate tech is serviced, with founders forced to close shop when the money runs dry.

The key question in the space is how to make climate tech bankable.
Over the past few years, we’ve seen an influx of private capital flow toward climate tech innovations, and this is critical to facilitating our green transition – the public sector alone won’t solve the climate crisis. Yet, we’re still far from where we need to be, with Deloitte estimating a private funding gap of approximately US$2 trillion.
To plug this gap, I believe there are three things we must achieve — what I call the three Ds of climate tech: demystify, de-risk, and design.
Demystifying climate tech
Often, climate tech deals require deep technical knowledge to evaluate, which stems from the complex nature of the technologies involved. Investors who lack the expertise typically steer clear of these deals.
Making matters worse, many climate tech startups are shrouded in secrecy and fail to explain the mechanics behind their solutions.
Instead of keeping things locked in a black box, founders should explain that most risks are a matter of engineering, not physics. The science behind many net-zero solutions already exists and has often been proven in other applications as individual components.
Infinited Fiber is an example of a firm that has demystified its business model by providing clear explanations behind its recycling tech and dissecting its operational processes. It uses the established principles of chemical engineering to break down cellulose from textile waste at the molecular level before creating a liquid cellulose which is then spun into a new fiber filament.
The company has demonstrated that its solution is grounded in science. While one of its competitors shut its doors amid textile recycling uncertainty, Infinited Fiber closed a 40 million euro (approximately US$43 million) funding round.
By simplifying complex structures, reducing opaque processes, and presenting data- and science-backed solutions, founders can persuade investors that their ideas are feasible.
From an investor front, the onus is on fund managers to upskill through relevant programs and hire the right technical talent with industry know-how so they have the capabilities to assess climate tech deals and won’t miss a sizable chunk of the market.
De-risking climate tech
De-risking climate tech is a multifaceted task. For a start, climate tech firms must develop resilient and stable supply chains.
Upstream, this involves identifying credible suppliers to secure raw materials early on and qualifying alternative materials that could serve as substitutes during supply chain disruptions. Larger firms could also reduce their dependence on partners through vertical integration.
For example, Hived, a parcel service provider with a zero-emission delivery network, employs an end-to-end approach to parcel delivery by leasing an electric vehicle fleet, employing its own drivers, and operating decentralized sorting mini-hubs. Through vertical integration, it has reduced costs by capturing value across the chain and can maintain tighter quality control.
Downstream, climate tech firms could diversify their pool of clients to hedge against counterparty risk. They could also leverage AI to forecast demand and negotiate offtake agreements to mitigate market risk.

Case in point, India’s Acme Group secured a long-term deal with Europe’s largest fertilizer maker, Yara International, to sell ammonia. Covering over 100,000 tons a year, the partnership is the world’s first arm’s length contract for renewable ammonia of this scale.
Aside from this, climate tech firms could increase speed to market by introducing modular approaches that reduce operational complexity. Canoo, an EV company, adopts a modular approach to its manufacturing process, where a proprietary and highly versatile skateboard chassis serves as the backbone of all its vehicles. (Full disclosure, the author previously invested in Canoo and divested in November 2021.)
By using a common platform, the company can rapidly scale subsequent vehicle rollouts at a significantly faster rate and lower cost. In fact, Canoo estimates that it can develop new vehicles 3x faster than its peers in the automotive industry.
Lastly, climate tech firms could tap into government schemes to finance growth. A simple search will reveal the prevalence of such schemes, given huge regulatory pushes for sustainability across the globe.
The US and Europe have historically led climate regulations, with schemes such as the 2022 US Inflation Reduction Act pouring over half a trillion US dollars into climate tech over the next decade. Singapore leads the pack within Asia, with initiatives such as the S$50 million (approximately US$37 million) SG Eco Fund by its Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment supporting solutions advancing environmental sustainability.
Designing fund mechanics to support climate tech
Asset-heavy climate tech firms often lack a clear breakeven point and take longer to scale up, unlike traditional asset-light technology firms. For instance, while the average time from series A to series D stages for digital marketplaces is three years, climate tech firms take about seven years to achieve scale.
Given that the time horizon of a VC fund is usually 10 years, there simply isn’t enough time for gains to materialize, unless the fund makes an early exit.
Nonetheless, climate tech investments can pay off over the long run. Since investors ultimately seek risk-adjusted financial returns, they should accommodate this sector’s unique challenges by getting creative when designing fund mechanics.
One way to shift the focus to long-term deals is by extending the investment horizon to circumvent the limitations of a standard lifecycle fund. For instance, Bill Gates’s Breakthrough Energy Ventures invests in 20-year cycles.
Evergreen funds are another avenue investors could explore, as they can continuously accept new capital and recycle funds from exits for new investments without fixed termination dates. Over the past decade, we’ve seen the aggregate assets under management of evergreen funds focused on private capital more than quadruple to US$430 billion.
For VC funds nearing termination, establishing continuation funds is a viable option to consider. Continuation funds are a secondary investment vehicle that allows fund managers to “reset the clock” on assets in old funds by selling them to a new vehicle they also control.
By rolling over investments, the fund’s life cycle is effectively extended, giving portfolio companies continued stability and more time to execute their plans. In recent years, US$25 billion venture firm New Enterprise Associates and New York-based Insight Partners, as well as several tech investors, have set up continuation funds in response to the changing economic climate.
Climate tech founders should know that early-stage investing is more an art than a science, so matching up with the right investors is important. For the relationship to be mutually beneficial, investors must see the startup’s value and meaningfully contribute to its growth.
Bridge to bankability under construction
I recently asked a friend why he started a climate tech fund instead of one in a hotter sector like Web3 or AI. His response was simple: “It’s not because I’m a tree hugger, but because there is money to be made.”
Putting aside the regulatory tailwinds that are making climate tech a more attractive investment, there’s a huge untapped opportunity in the sector, and more investors are starting to realize this. As we continue to demystify, de-risk, and design fund mechanics suitable for climate tech innovations, we’ll eventually get to scale.",The complex nature of climate tech – coupled with the risk involved in backing it – makes it a tough sell for many VC firms.,Joash Lee,Editing by Peter Cowan and Jaclyn Tiu,open,0,"",https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705055873_Newsletter-GIF-Staving-off-climate-change-1200x640-1.gif,false,"",false,true,true,true,false,6,,1271,"Climate tech has a bankability problem, but there are 3 ways to fix that",The complex nature of climate tech – coupled with the risk involved in backing it – makes it a tough sell for many VC firms.,,,"","",""

Ninja Van, a major logistics player in Southeast Asia, has laid off some of its tech staff amid ongoing initiatives to reduce costs.
“Following a recent cost evaluation, it was determined that less than 10% of the region’s tech team is no longer required,” a Ninja Van spokesperson confirmed to Tech in Asia.
The person added that the company has done other cost-cutting measures across its tech team, including infrastructural reorganization and outsourcing.
While the person did not provide any specific number of affected positions, a source close to the company told Tech in Asia that 21 people from Ninja Van’s Singapore tech office were laid off. This amounts to roughly 20% of the company’s tech team in the city-state, the source added.
In an email sent to staff seen by Tech in Asia, Cheehan Tee, Ninja Van’s vice president for engineering, said that the layoffs were “an absolute last resort” that the company had to take, as the outcome from its previous measures “still wasn’t enough.”
However, Tee stressed that Ninja Van is “not cutting the size and capability” of its tech team but is optimizing associated costs.
“Tech is critical in driving Ninja Van’s success, and we remain upbeat on the long-term outlook of the business, particularly the potential of the B2B Restock and Cold Chain initiatives,” Tee wrote.
The layoffs come after the Singapore-based company’s revenue declined 7% year on year in FY 2023, which was mainly due to an almost 20% drop in parcels handled. Its operating losses also grew 32% in the same period.
Lai Chang Wen, CEO of Ninja Van, was unfazed, expecting the company to report EBITDA breakeven in 2025. A factor that could help it get there is the firm’s expansion into new verticals, including its B2B arm Ninja Mart and its cold chain logistics business.
“Our mistake was thinking [ecommerce] was our only path,” Lai previously said.
Meanwhile, workers who were laid off were given a “reasonable severance package” to help with their transition from Ninja Van, said the spokesperson.
According to the email sent by Tee, those affected will have access to the company’s office and chat platform until the end of this week. Medical insurance and mental health support will be offered until June 30.
They will also be given job placement support, a month of severance pay per full year of employment, and garden leave until their official last day of May 31. The deadline set for exercising vested options was also extended from 30 days to 1 year for those affected.

However, while the funding winter rages on, Vietnam appears to be weathering the snowstorm. The country has seen startup investments rise consistently since 2018, peaking at US$1.9 billion in 2021. While funding has taken a hit since then, Vietnam’s startup ecosystem still bagged the most amount of funding in Southeast Asia in 2023. The market came in third after Singapore and Indonesia, according to Tech in Asia data.
This growth speaks to Vietnam’s potential as an ecosystem, being home to a young, well-educated population that’s tech-savvy and excited about the benefits of digitalization. Indeed, investors are starting to take notice.

At our upcoming Saigon Summit, speakers from some of Southeast Asia’s leading VC firms will discuss the investment environment in Vietnam.
Ahead of the event, we hear from Monk’s Hill Ventures partner Justin Nguyen to get his perspectives on the opportunities the market holds and why he’s excited about Vietnam.
The following interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.
What do you do at Monk’s Hill Ventures?
Invest! Simply put, we invest in the most ambitious tech founders in Southeast Asia. At our core, we believe that technology can help better the lives of millions in the region, so we spend a lot of our day-to-day working with some of the most ambitious tech founders in Southeast Asia to help them build and achieve their ambitions.
This includes companies that we’ve funded – like Elsa and Jio Health here in Vietnam – but also non-portfolio companies at various stages in their journey throughout Southeast Asia.

In addition to our investment and portfolio management duties, the partners of the firm (of which I’m one of four) are also responsible for the overall management of the firm. This includes setting its strategic direction, managing relationships with limited partners, overseeing the firm’s operations, and mentoring staff.
What do you think about the current funding environment in Vietnam?
There’s no doubt about it: The funding environment in Southeast Asia is tough. The headlines are that 2023 funding in the region is down nearly 50% from 2022 levels.
The good news is that Vietnam has been more resilient, only seeing a 10% dip in the same period. This indicates that investors remain attracted to the market’s robust economic growth, young skilled population, and its huge services industry that’s ripe for “technification.”
If we zoom out, this is largely true for the entire region, so there’s actually a lot to be optimistic about. In fact, I believe the next decade will be even more interesting than the previous one. Seventy percent of Southeast Asia has just entered or is about to enter the magical US$4,000 per capita gross domestic product (GDP) mark where necessities are no longer a struggle and discretionary spending happens. Indonesia got there in 2021, Vietnam got there in 2022, and the Philippines is close behind. That’s 500 million people that are just starting to save and finally have the discretionary income to really consume.
Why are you excited about Vietnam as a market?
Market attractiveness is ultimately about macros and people. Are the market fundamentals going to produce sizable opportunities and does the human capital exist to answer those opportunities? And I would argue that the answer is a solid yes to both in Vietnam.
On the macro front, we have a fast-growing consumer market with a burgeoning middle class. Our domestic consumption contributes to over 50% of our GDP, and we are on track to become a top 10 consumer market in the world by 2030. As demand rises, this will fuel multiple sectors – from technology products to healthcare, education, energy, and services, many of which are well positioned for technification. These developments will create fertile ground for more startups to grow and thrive and possibly set the foundation for them to expand beyond Vietnam. We are seeing early signs of this.

On the people front, the population is young, tech-savvy, and ambitious. Domestically, Vietnam produces roughly 100,000 engineers per year, accounting for about 40% of university graduates.
Additionally, although Vietnam accounts for less than one-sixth of the region’s population, nearly half of Southeast Asia’s college and university students in the US are Vietnamese. In other words, Vietnam sends more students to the US than Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand combined. This largely young, educated population, plus a sizable returning diaspora, are the people ingredients necessary for an explosion in tech innovations.
What advice do you have for founders looking to start up in Vietnam?
Get started! Figure out your big problem to solve, have unit economics that are solid, develop go-to-market strategies that are scalable, and just go for it.
What will you be speaking about at Tech in Asia’s Saigon Summit and why is it important?
The headlines are filled with doom and gloom, so I want to remind founders that economic downturns are a great time to start companies and help shed some light on what venture investors are looking for when evaluating companies.
Many of today’s tech giants – including Airbnb, Uber, and Slack – were founded around the time of the 2008 financial crisis. It’s no wonder why, as talent is more abundant and often more affordable, there’s less competition due to the perceived risks, and people and companies alike are encouraged to look at innovative solutions that reduce costs or improve efficiencies.

Hear from Justin, as well as a host of other exciting speakers, at Tech in Asia’s upcoming Saigon Summit. Held on May 30 at GEM Center, Ho Chi Minh City, we’re bringing together some of Southeast Asia’s best and brightest to chart Vietnam’s tech future together.

Beam, a global micromobility player, said it grew its gross revenue by 36% year on year in 2023, amounting to US$53 million.
This jump was driven by increased demand for its e-scooters and e-bikes, the company said. In 2023, Beam also cut group expenses by 25%, which helped the firm achieve EBITDA profitability in the latter half of the year.
“We are seeing an uptick in commuter usage, both for work and study, particularly in mature micromobility markets such as Australia, New Zealand, and South Korea,” Alan Jiang, CEO of Beam, told Tech in Asia.
The company aims to increase vehicle availability and introduce new models to provide smoother and more regular services similar to conventional public transit.
Beam operates in over 130 cities across eight countries, including Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, and Turkey.
Jiang said the company focuses on markets that have regulatory frameworks that would allow Beam to offer its services at a national level. It then establishes local partnerships with governments, universities, businesses, and tourism bodies.
However, Beam is currently not active in its home country of Singapore – something Jiang is hopeful they can change some time in the future.
“We’re excited about the potential of micromobility in Singapore and are confident that recent upgrades to shared micromobility technology […] can address many of the concerns seen during Singapore’s previous shared micromobility programs,” he added. These upgrades include those in path detection and GPS capabilities.
While Jiang said that Beam would be interested in exploring potential partnerships in Singapore, the focus right now for the company is profitability, “which means we are focused on launching our services in countries that already have existing micromobility programs for e-scooters and e-bikes in place.”
The exec marked Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, and Turkey as its current target markets. For these countries, Beam will focus on boosting accessibility and affordability, he added.
To bankroll these expansion efforts, Jiang said the company will mainly be using debt financing, prioritizing a more prudent use of capital over raising funds. It last raised a series B round in 2022, securing US$93 million.
“We have seen a number of companies in the micromobility industry look to consolidate or exit the market, and the reduced competition has allowed us to consolidate our position and run more efficient operations,” Jiang pointed out. 
Some of the company’s active competitors include Singapore-based Neuron, which also has operations in Australia and New Zealand. Similar to Beam, Neuron is not currently active in Singapore.

Indonesia’s GoTo Group showed an 89% year-on-year improvement in adjusted EBITDA, reporting an adjusted loss of 102 billion rupiah (US$6.2 million) for the first quarter of 2024.
The company had logged an adjusted EBITDA of US$4.9 million in Q4 of 2023, its first and only adjusted profitable quarter so far.
“We expect even faster growth for the rest of the year, while also remaining committed to our profitability goals,” Patrick Walujo, CEO of GoTo Group, said in a statement.
The company remains on track to meet its target “to maintain adjusted EBITDA profitability for the full year of 2024,” according to CFO Jacky Lo.
Meanwhile, gross revenues were up 18% at US$256.7 million on a pro-forma basis in Q1 2024, but they were down 11.3% on an actual basis during the quarter.
According to the company’s statement, the pro-forma figures were calculated taking into account that Tokopedia and its associated delivery and fulfillment businesses under GoTo Logistics were deconsolidated as of January 1, 2023.
TikTok had acquired 75% of Tokopedia, GoTo’s ecommerce business, for US$1.8 billion in January as its market share had been diminishing. Tokopedia was classified as an associate company as of February 1, 2024.
GoTo said it recorded US$6.7 million in ecommerce service fee revenues in February and March, “which is expected to increase as the [TikTok-Tokopedia] partnership deepens over future quarters.”
The gross revenue of Gojek, its on-demand services arm, rose 12% in Q1 to US$206 million. Its fintech segment logged a 57% jump in gross revenue at US$41 million as well.
Meanwhile, GoTo’s losses were down 85% year on year at US$25.8 million.
It attributed the overall performance to user growth, the addition of buy now, pay later in ecommerce, and accelerated integration and payments adoption associated with TikTok.
GoTo’s total group transaction value also climbed by 20% to US$7.1 billion in Q1.
Currency converted from Indonesian rupiah to US dollars: US$1 = 16,232 rupiah.

Bukalapak reached profitability in the first quarter of financial year 2024, generating US$922,500 in adjusted EBITDA.
This indicates a 142% year-on-year improvement from FY 2023, when the Indonesia-based ecommerce firm posted US$14.2 million in adjusted losses.
It also grew its revenue by 16% year on year to US$72.9 million. Bukalapak’s core earnings were also up 60% on a quarter over quarter basis to US$11.4 million.
“This is a fantastic result for the company and a result which has been achieved with strong top-line revenue growth, a thriving take rate – especially in the O2O [online-to-offline] segment – and excellent cost control,” said Teddy Oetomo, Bukalapak’s president.
The company attributed the growth in its O2O unit, MitraBukalapak, to improvements in its service offerings to clients. The business contributed 55% of the firm’s total revenues for the period.
Oetomo also highlighted that the company placed outright growth in the backburner and has been prioritizing profitability – a feat it previously aimed to achieve by the end of 2023.
Nevertheless, Bukalapak’s overall group expenses improved in Q1 2024, mostly due to a decrease in general and administrative expenses. This is despite a slight year-on-year jump in cost of revenue.
“We’re very focused on executing towards our stated goal of sustainable and profitable growth in the coming quarters and throughout 2025 as we continue to capture the growth opportunities that exist within our mitra, gaming, and e-retailing businesses,” Oetomo noted.

Healthtech startup Thrixen has raised US$7 million in a round co-led by 22Health Ventures, an early-stage healthtech investment firm, and John Ballantyne, co-founder of biotech player Aldevron.
Thrixen said it will use the funds to advance the development of its diagnostic tech platform, which has the potential to perform multiplex diagnostic tests at the point of care for the first time.
“At the heart of this innovation is Thrixen’s proprietary assay technology, a protein engineering platform that replaces the use of antibodies, which has proven 99.5% sensitivity in clinical trials conducted to date,” said the Singapore-based startup.
The company noted that the tech under development allows for a rapid test to distinguish between bacterial and viral infections within 10 minutes based on a finger-prick sample.
Investment by 22Health Ventures, on top of the capital, provides Thrixen an accelerated access to the US market and management guidance as the VC firm’s founder and managing partner, Ara Tavitian, will join the startup as a board member, said Thrixen.
“This investment and our new partnerships will be instrumental in allowing Thrixen to develop its initial use cases in ways that will facilitate successful clinical trials and establish a robust regulatory package to bring our product to market,” said Shavit Clein, CEO of Thrixen.

Indonesia-based DailySocial.id, a startup-focused news platform, has laid off all of its staff as part of a major restructuring of its business.
The tech media outlet made the announcement on April 1 this year, announcing that the employment of its whole workforce will be terminated by the end of this month, its CEO Rama Mamuaya confirmed to DealStreetAsia.
While the firm did not release the actual number of affected staff, there are 32 people associated with the the company on LinkedIn.
Mamuaya added that DailySocial.id will still be publishing content and will not be shutting down its entire operations, as there is still a team working at the firm, though it’s not clear whether these employees will also be leaving.
The company will share more information on the restructuring on May 2, the report noted.
The development follows a wave of layoffs in August last year – which affected 18 personnel – due to “the economic situation and tech downturn,” Mamuaya told Tech in Asia in a previous statement. At the time, the exec said the company was looking to achieve profitability by the end of this year.
The August 2023 layoffs came just months after the launch of DS/X Ventures, the firm’s investment unit that focuses on early-stage companies. The VC arm has invested in eight companies so far, according to its website.
DS/X was also looking to launch a second fund this year. It is unclear if the VC arm was affected by the current layoffs, though Mamuaya previously said that DailySocial.id had a separate and independent editorial team.

Venture capital firm Flourish Ventures has named Ravi Kaushik as executive director and head of Asia investments.
Kaushik will lead the firm’s fintech investments and portfolio management in Southeast Asia and India, aiming to grow Flourish Ventures’ presence there.
Given that they are “the fast-growing regions in the world,” there is “a multi-decade opportunity to invest in and build with some of the best founders,” he said in a statement.
Before this, Kaushik was the CFO of Agro.Club, a grain-trading platform based in the US. In total, he has over 15 years of experience in operating businesses and investing across venture capital and private equity. He was also a founding member at Indian VC firm WaterBridge Ventures, which he exited in 2023.
US-headquartered Flourish Ventures, which focuses on the fintech sector, had secured US$350 million in funding last year. The firm holds US$850 million under management globally.
With a larger capital and team, Flourish Ventures aims to enhance fintech investments in the US, Africa, Asia, and Latin America. As of October 2023, it had invested in over 71 fintech startups worldwide and counted eBay founder Pierre Omidyar as its sole limited partner.

We break down the big and messy topics of Asia’s tech and startup community. Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a premium subscription.
Hello reader,
Today’s newsletter looks at Yuu, a consumer rewards program here in Singapore. It’s got quite the marketing campaign going on, with actor Gurmit Singh taking on the mantle of his most iconic character, contractor Phua Chu Kang, to promote the program via a catchy tune.
I’ve got the Yuu app on my phone and a membership with the company, but I’m definitely not a power user. I don’t really shop at Yuu’s partners, which include Cold Storage and Guardian, so having the app is just part of my weak attempts at trying to maximize whatever rewards I can. Every penny counts, right?
For what it’s worth, I currently have a whopping 165 points on Yuu, which is equivalent to the grand sum of S$0.82 (US$0.60). Do you see what I mean when I’m not a power user?
However, while I’m not big on Yuu (yet), over 1 million people use the app in Singapore each month. And there seems to be a lot more going on with it than meets the eye.
Today we look at:


Yuu, the Temasek-backed consumer loyalty program 
Foodtech decacorn Swiggy’s IPO plans 
Other newsy highlights such as Nvidia’s US$700 million acquisition of an AI startup and ShopBack’s expansion into New Zealand 


Premium summary
Nobody, nobody, but Yuu

Launched in October 2022, the consumer rewards program Yuu has over 1 million monthly active users in Singapore – over 15% of the country’s population – and has been downloaded almost 1.2 million times as of March 2024. We take a closer look.


Behind Yuu: Yuu is the product of Minden.ai, a joint venture between Singapore state-owned investment firm Temasek and Hong Kong-based DFI Retail Group, which owns and operates retailers such as Cold Storage, Giant, and 7-Eleven in Singapore.

The reason for Yuu: On the surface, the Yuu rewards program appears to be another loyalty program seeking to address a fragmented rewards space. However, the firm says it uses AI to deliver a “hyperpersonalized consumer experience.” It also claims to be “unrivaled” among loyalty programs in Singapore in terms of strength, appeal, and value to customers.

Spending on Yuu: Marketing for the rewards platform has entailed significant costs so far. According to ACRA filings, Minden Singapore made a net loss of US$13.5 million for the financial year ending March 2023 against a revenue of US$2.6 million. It was the first financial year in which the firm reported revenue since its incorporation in September 2021.

Swig, swag, Swiggy

Indian foodtech decacorn Swiggy is aiming to raise US$1.25 billion via an IPO.


Money, honey: The US$1.25 billion will come from two avenues – US$450 million from new shares and US$800 million from existing investors offloading their shares. 

V for valuation: Swiggy was valued at over US$10.7 billion in early 2022, and some investors currently peg that figure at US$12 billion. It holds nearly half of India’s food delivery market share.

Not so fast:  That said, the company has not yet filed IPO documents with the Securities and Exchange Board of India.

After implementing a buy now, pay later code of conduct (BNPL code), The Singapore Fintech Association (SFA) and the BNPL Working Group handed out TrustMark accreditations to four service providers: Abnk, Atome, Grab, and SeaMoney.
The accreditation signifies the companies’ commitment to meeting the guidelines outlined in the BNPL code, according to a statement from SFA.
The SFA and the BNPL Working Group – which consists of players like Atome, Grab Financial Group, and ShopBack – have been working on the code since 2022. With the initiative, they aim to protect customers from financial issues like overindebtedness.
Under the code, accredited players will prohibit customers from accumulating over S$2,000 (US$1,470) in outstanding payments, unless they apply for an additional assessment. The financial institutions are also required to offer financial hardship assistance to customers in need and have a cap in all fees, including late fees, among other best practices.
The SFA said the accreditation was given to the four players after an independent assement by Price Waterhouse Coopers and a following evaluation by the SFA.
“Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) will continue to work with the industry to ensure that the BNPL code of conduct remains effective in upholding users’ interests,” said Loo Siew Yee, assistant managing director at MAS.
The BNPL code comes amid a rocky past year for the region’s deferred payments industry. Singapore-based Pace filed to shutter its business in August 2023 and ShopBack – which is in the BNPL Working Group – discontinued its PayLater biz.
Meanwhile, the TikTok Shop-Tokopedia tie-up announced its planned entry to the BNPL sector, which came just months after they finalized their partnership.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk is expected to have talks in Beijing about the potential launch of the electric vehicle firm’s full self-driving (FSD) software and discuss permissions to move data overseas, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Musk had visited China unannounced, saying on X (formerly Twitter) yesterday that he had met with Premier Li Qiang. “We have known each other now for many years, since early Shanghai days,” the CEO added.
Tesla had inked a deal for a factory in Shanghai in 2018, and Musk announced earlier this month that FSD would be available in China “very soon.”
To help with the self-driving feature’s launch, Tesla is also said to be working with Baidu for mapping and navigation, Bloomberg reported citing sources briefed on the situation.
The company is also reportedly planning to release cheaper models and a self-driving “robotaxi” to maintain market leadership.
China’s complex traffic helps train self-driving technologies quickly, Reuters said, citing industry experts. Other EV firms, including Chinese player Xpeng, are also looking to launch FSD software of their own.
Meanwhile, General Motors’ CEO Mary Barra also reportedly visited China during a prominent auto show last week.
Additionally, Musk wants to use Chinese data to improve Tesla’s self-driving tech globally. Since 2021, Tesla has stored Chinese fleet data in Shanghai, following local laws.

845959,2024-04-29T02:00:41,2024-04-26T02:30:51,Everyday impact: How these Shopee employees are making a difference,everyday-impact-shopee-employees-making-difference,publish,post,https://www.techinasia.com/everyday-impact-shopee-employees-making-difference,"Ecommerce has opened doors for many in Southeast Asia. People can now access products and solutions they couldn’t have before, and they can do so all with a few taps on a smartphone.
As Southeast Asia’s ecommerce ecosystem continues to grow, Shopee has emerged as one of the key players. The company has extended its impact further by expanding into e-wallets with ShopeePay, driving greater financial inclusion in the region.
The digital wallet is a point of pride for Xu Yaohe, a product manager for ShopeePay.

“In many parts of Southeast Asia, transferring money has typically incurred fees that can be quite prohibitive,” she says. “We want to minimize the costs to enable users to transact and transfer money freely.”
Driving financial inclusion
Xu – after a stint at Ernst &amp; Young as an IT consultant – joined Shopee in 2019 as a product manager overseeing a credit card gateway product.
“Having seen how digital payments evolved in the US and China, [Shopee] offered an exciting and interesting opportunity to get involved with Southeast Asia’s digital payments,” she explains.
In her current role, Xu works with different teams to improve the digital wallet’s services. She’s focused on understanding user behavior and building solutions that address their needs.
An example? The standalone ShopeePay app that was recently launched in Indonesia.
“Users’ phones may not be the newest models, so storage is limited, and the kind of apps they can run smoothly is limited as well,” Xu shares. “The standalone ShopeePay app is lighter compared to our main ecommerce app, so it runs faster, giving more users access to digital payments to pay and transact freely.”

She’s excited about the impact that ShopeePay has had in the larger story of financial inclusion, allowing more customers to pay for goods and services online, and more merchants – even brick-and-mortar ones – to accept digital payments.
“End users can transact more online. If you’re traveling and need to pay, or you’re a foreign worker looking to remit money back home, digital payment options like ShopeePay can be a way of doing so without incurring hefty fees,” Xu says. For merchants, they can also target new segments of users to grow their business, she shares.
“It’s very rewarding to see how the things that we’ve done have changed people’s lives.”
Greater efficiency, better service
Shopee has had a front-row seat to Southeast Asia’s digital inclusion transformation – in 2021, the region saw 70 million new online shoppers emerge as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.
With so many new customers coming on board, ensuring an optimal user experience was paramount – which is why for Tan Hong Ting, Shopee’s customer service and warehouse operations are crucial to the ecommerce firm’s digital inclusion mission.
Tan’s journey with the company started in 2019, when he joined Shopee as a regional operations associate in the customer service department. In this role, he worked to make Shopee’s customer service more efficient using data-driven insights.

“I was looking for a work culture that was dynamic and vibrant,” he says. At Shopee, he found what he was looking for.
A breakthrough moment for his career happened when he was sent to Thailand in 2021. At the time, Shopee’s Thailand operations faced challenges with lockdowns and movement restrictions. While the restrictions led to a surge in new customers and orders as people turned to ecommerce to make their purchases, they also made it difficult for orders to be fulfilled on time.
Customer enquiries were through the roof, and the customer service team in Thailand was at the forefront of managing this load – the team needed more manpower and more efficiency.
As part of the team, Tan helped develop training plans so that new staff could get up to speed quickly. He also worked on a chatbot featuring an automated reply system that guided customers on how they could find answers to common queries on the Shopee app, allowing the customer service team to handle more complex cases.
“We managed to bring down the abandon rates – where users give up before reaching a customer service representative – across all channels within a few weeks of implementing these solutions,” he says.
After his customer service stint, Tan joined Shopee’s warehouse team in Thailand, working to optimize its operations.

“With warehouse operations, it was really about how we could minimize lead times and boost efficiency to ensure that every Shopee order is fulfilled with consistent quality,” he recalls. “What’s the most optimal use of the warehouse to store the most amount of parcels? How can we make the parcel picking process more efficient?”
As part of the optimization process, Tan dedicated time to working directly in the warehouse. This hands-on experience provided him with a better understanding of the situation on the ground, enabling him to help the team develop effective solutions.
“The head of operations actually came down and packed parcels himself,” he shares. “It gave me a new perspective on leadership. It taught me that to make things happen, I should also lead by example and be ready to dive in, boots on the ground.”
For Tan, driving digital inclusion hinges on providing an optimal customer experience, one that allows customers to enjoy the best of what the digital economy can offer. This is something he does as well in his current role, where he now spearheads the regional last-mile hub team at SPX Express, a Shopee logistics partner.
“The better the solution I come up with, the faster we can get products into the hands of our customers. That is something very tangible for millions of people,” Tan shares.
Impact within
On top of their work helping users, Xu and Tan have made a difference to a group of people much closer to home: their teams.

Tan has benefited from the mentorship of senior management at Shopee and also participated in more formal initiatives such as the firm’s Accelerated Development Programme (ADP). The ADP offers staff leadership training and one-on-one mentorship from senior leaders at the company, giving him not just tools that improved his abilities as a manager but also a network of peers and mentors.
“I’ve been very lucky to have mentors who have been very intentional in grooming me to be a leader,” he shares. “Now, I want to do the same with my team, to understand their motivations and put them in places where they can succeed.”
Xu, too, gained new perspectives on management from the leadership training programs. While she started out as a very “instructions-based” leader, she now tailors her management style to better support and guide her team members as they make their own decisions.
“I went from being a product manager to being a people manager as well.” she shares.
On the road ahead, both Xu and Tan are looking to make an even bigger difference through their work.
“Southeast Asia is a very big market,” says Xu. “I want to gain a deeper understanding of the different markets and different user needs and better address the opportunities to facilitate cross-border payments across the whole region.”
“The top priority is always ‘how can we serve our users better?’” Tan shares.

Shopee is a leading ecommerce platform in Southeast Asia and Taiwan. It believes in digital transformation and is passionate about harnessing the power of technology to better the lives of consumers and small businesses.

Here’s what it needs to do instead,malaysias-tech-hub-plan-rehashes-ideas-heres-what-it-needs-to-do,publish,post,https://www.techinasia.com/malaysias-tech-hub-plan-rehashes-ideas-heres-what-it-needs-to-do,"​Dan Lain-Lain (Malay for “and others”) is a weekly column by TIA journalist Emmanuel Samarathisa that dissects the goings-on in the Malaysia tech scene, but with a heavy mix of current affairs, policy and politics. Click here to read past articles.
Malaysia’s KL20 Summit was held last week and featured a host of startup and tech personalities as speakers or panelists.
KL20 essentially stands for Kuala Lumpur 20. It signifies the government’s ambition for the capital city to be among the top 20 startup hubs in the world by 2030.

To make this happen, the government released an action paper that details some of the steps that it intends to take to make Kuala Lumpur attractive for startups, founders, VCs, and just about anyone involved in the tech ecosystem.
One of the standouts from the action paper – because it was widely reported – is the clutch of golden passes the country is offering.
There’s the Unicorn Golden Pass to attract global unicorns to set up shop in Malaysia. Perks include exempted fees for employment passes for senior management, subsidized rental fees, concessionary tax rates on corporate profits and relocation services.
There’s also the Innovation Pass, a multi-tier employment pass program, as well as the VC Golden Pass, which offers limited partners funding access opportunities, subsidized office spaces, expedited license registrations, and exempted fees for employment passes.
Other initiatives include a VC school where aspiring professionals or young fund managers would attend a course on the basics of the business, including financial analysis.
It all sounds good, but does it stand up to scrutiny?
Wither, USP
No one in the conference actually answered what Malaysia’s unique selling point was.
Let’s be real: VCs want money. And who can say no to government money? Anyway, let me illustrate: One of the panelists – I’m not going to mention who – on Day 2 told the audience that Malaysia is a “sleeping giant.”
The person, who runs a Southeast Asia fund, based this observation on how some of their investee companies have branches or subsidiaries in Malaysia.
That same panel had others who were looking at Malaysia more closely now despite being in the region for some time. These were people who’d boast about investing in unicorns and so on.
What this panelist essentially described was Malaysia being a back office. And I’m not sure if anyone on the panel realized that that is the climate right now.
Why would you domicile in Singapore? Because you want to be located in the financial hub of the region, which in turn makes things a lot easier, especially for fundraising. This is the reality that many Malaysian founders have come to accept, and they have domiciled their companies in Singapore to be close to the funding pool.
Many startups are also located in Indonesia. Why? Because it’s a large, dynamic country, with a population that dwarfs Malaysia.
The Lorry, a Malaysian logistics company, decided to uproot and move to Indonesia to capture market share there.
This problem then raises the effectiveness of the KL20 action plan. Why would a unicorn or a top-tier VC set up shop in Malaysia? These guys deal in hundreds of millions of dollars. Do you think they would be bothered by discounts on office space? Surely not.
Also, most of the top-tier VCs are domiciled in Singapore, for all the seemingly right reasons. Malaysia is getting a bad reputation in general for a lot of things – from the politics to the affirmative action policies – that you don’t get in Singapore. Malaysians themselves are also domiciling in Singapore.
So how do we convince people to domicile in Malaysia?
Rinse and repeat
Most of the perks you’d find in the KL20 action plan are what Malaysia has been offering multinationals and expats over the years.
Attracting overseas VCs to domicile? We’ve done that. Mavcap had that with its outsourced partners’ program. That’s how Gobi Partners was able to set up shop in Kuala Lumpur. The government’s fund-of-funds Penjana Kapital was supposed to do that too, but we don’t know how successful the firm is since accountability is short.

Science, Technology and Innovation Minister Chang Lih Kang speaking to the press on Day 2 of the KL20 Summit / Photo credit: KL20 Summit

The VC Golden Pass? There were a slew of proposed perks for co-working or office spaces in the past such as the so-called digital hub initiative under government agency Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC). That dream has been in the making since 2020, but nothing came out of that.
VC school? Yeah, that is what Penjana Kapital is doing, but then do aspiring VCs need to go to school? And if they do, where are they going to go? Surely not the nearby coffee shop.
The Innovation Pass, while a bold measure, resembles what Singapore had in the early 2000s called Entrepass. Applications for the Innovation Pass will be with MDEC, which is under the digital ministry. The unknown here is the level of buy-in from the Immigration Department, which is under the home affairs ministry.
Where do we go?
I wager Malaysia is a good place to domicile if you’re a B2B startup. Some have done well, such as graphic design platform Piktochart. Others come from older tech industries such as the semiconductor space.
At KL20, the government predictably milked the positive PR around Malaysia’s chip industry, though proof of the pudding is in the investment approvals, which comes under the Malaysian Investment Development Authority (MIDA).
An example is if Malaysia were to attract an investment on the same level as Singapore’s newly minted semiconductor startup Silicon Box, MIDA would be the agent that’ll either make or break that investment.
But be it hardware or software, the angle is B2B. And there were hints at the KL20 summit, so that’s a good step in the right direction.
We should also retire this whole Malaysia-as-a-testbed thinking. Most investors, including a few at KL20, stated that because Malaysia’s population is neither too large nor too small, it’s a good petri dish.
But that lacks nuance. Malaysia is fragmented in and of itself. For example, Sabah and Sarawak operate on different immigration rules than in the Peninsular. That is why the digital nomad pass, launched in October 2022, is still only applicable to states in Peninsular Malaysia.
Startups who have tried scaling to different states, especially rural or semi-urban ones such as Kelantan or Pahang, know how difficult it can be to sell their product there.
Now, instead of luring in foreign talent, perhaps we should seriously nurture or fund the ones here. This has been mentioned in the country’s VC roadmap, but it’s not front and center. Definitely not at the KL20 Summit.
There were many boutique firms and angels attending the event. The government and agencies have not reached out to them.
Why? It would have been a no-brainer to work something out with those in the trenches because ultimately that’s what you’d want. They are less institutionalized, have a better lay of the land, and are more willing to take risks.
A VC firm is generally a low headcount business. Seeding newer or boutique VCs and requiring them to take on aspiring Malaysian VCs for a year of training is one way to nurture talent. There are only two ways to be a VC: you’re either a yuppie or you go through the apprenticeship wringer.
The other crucial point missing in all these is the that during the summit, we didn’t highlight front and centre some of the achievements we’ve had.
Now this is public relations 101 but for an event like KL20, that’s what it’s all about. If anything we failed to talk about — on the main stage, not during the side events or breakout sessions or the pop-up booths outside the halls — the startups or tech companies that are either based in Malaysia or have a large presence in the country.
Tech firms we could have promoted include the likes of Malaysian drone services provider Aerodyne or even Singapore-based used-car platform Carro, which have a significant market share in the country.
We could have thrown in Carsome, too, since it’s Malaysia’s first so-called unicorn.
Then there are startups that received overseas investments such as Pandai. The edtech platform is a funding recipient of US-based accelerator Y-Combinator.
We also didn’t sell that our institutions are investors in regional unicorns such as retirement fund Kumpulan Wang Persaraan’s (KWAP) investment in Indonesian aquatech giant eFishery.
But I realized two things while perambulating the corridors of the Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre those two days.
There’s genuine hunger to strike it big or nail a blockbuster investment among players in Malaysia, from VCs to founders. This is a good thing.
But they are operating in an environment that doesn’t highly reward such things. So it’s best to revise one’s thesis or mission statement to not concentrate too much on Malaysia but diversify and make the country a subset of a regional portfolio.

Hi readers,
The renowned actor, comedian, and filmmaker Charlie Chaplin once said “Life is a tragedy when seen in close-up, but a comedy in long-shot.”
This is a philosophy that I have come to use in dealing with tough circumstances in life, and it probably would help relieve the paralyzing anxiety that often hinders us from taking action.
I realize that many founders in the startup ecosystem today are between a rock and hard place. As the funding winter continues unabated this year, many founders are nearing the end of their runway and faced with a tough decision about the future of their startups: Should they sell for scraps or shutter?
So, in a recent piece, I explored  if there’s another option out there for founders to save their startups? It led me to finding new non-VC investors emerging across Southeast Asia.
Taking advantage of the plummeting valuations of startups, these investors – typically called turnaround funds –  aim to get a majority stake in targeted firms, mold them into profitable businesses, and then seek quick exits via acquisitions or public listings.
An example of this is Singapore-based Turn Capital, which acquired Flash Coffee’s Thai business last November.
Another type of investor on the block is the search fund, which allows aspiring entrepreneurs to locate, acquire, and grow small businesses, usually using investor money.
That said, I found out that turning around a business is no easy feat even for these investors. In addition, this piece explores if we will see the growth of such alternative startup investors in Southeast Asia.

Hello reader,
Variety truly is the spice of life.
How many people can honestly say they’d be okay with doing the same things every single day? Imagine eating the same exact dish, three times a day, for the rest of your life. It’d be like living in some sort of Sisyphean nightmare.
That’s why it’s important that once in a while, things get switched up and new ideas or experiences get introduced.
This week’s list of top deals is one of those times. Normally, we see startups coming from the usual suspects of Indonesia, India, or Singapore, but this time around, only India made the list. Instead, the rest hail from less common markets like Japan, Australia, and even Turkey.
Let’s take a look at these fresh faces and their equally fresh funding.

Thoughtful reads
1️⃣ A first-hand perspective
Product management can sometimes include a rather broad spectrum of responsibilities, so each person’s experience can be unique to their company. In some cases, this can lead to certain general misunderstandings about the role. To get a deeper understanding, here’s a personal account from a product manager.
2️⃣ An important layer
AI, at the end of the day, simply refers to a type of technology. How it’s developed is important, and one of the most essential things that needs to be built correctly is the user interfaces attached to AI solutions. This podcast episode goes into the topic a little more.
3️⃣ Cooling it
Everyone gets heated during an argument, unless you’re some kind of secret robot. However, there’s much to be gained in managing your emotions during tough conflicts at work. How can you do so effectively? Check out this podcast episode to find out.
4️⃣ Keeping it real
Let’s be honest – much of modern media has fallen into the clickbait and outrage trap in an effort to drive engagement. As regular consumers of the news, it’s important to learn how to discern what we should really care about, especially when politics are brought up. This Masters of Scale episode goes into more detail.
5️⃣ Pulling yourself up
To bootstrap or not to bootstrap – that’s the question on many founders’ minds, especially in a startup’s early days. However, the writer of this blog post argues that there’s “only one good reason” to choose the former.","Avaada Energy, Jingtaotao, Midas, and more raised funds this week",Jonathan Chew,Edited by Dhania Putri Sarahtika,open,0,"",https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1702634850_VC-Newsletter-GIF-Rooting-for-the-underdog-1200x640-1.gif,false,"",false,true,false,true,false,5,,1062,Some unusual faces make our top deals list this week,"Avaada Energy, Jingtaotao, Midas, and more raised funds this week",,,"","",""

Hello reader,
I watched a lot of Power Rangers growing up, and I always loved it when the different rangers combined their individual Zords – humanoid robots – to create the Megazord and take down the evil villain of the series.
It’s an allegory for the power of teamwork and friendship, and it also just looked really cool on TV. Here at Tech in Asia, we often liken mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) to Megazords.
After all, M&amp;As are a way for companies to grow stronger and become better versions of themselves, taking their products and services to new heights by combining forces. Today’s premium story features a firm that’s done just that, acquiring another company to grow even more.
Today we look at:

How an acquisition could unlock significant revenue growth for a customer experience firm  
Mintable’s ex-COO’s new GameFi startup 
Other newsy highlights such as TikTok’s potential ban in the US and Zilingo’s former CEO filing a criminal complaint against her ex-colleagues

Becoming something better

Singapore-headquartered cloud communications and customer experience provider Toku is planning to buy AiChat, a conversational AI customer experience platform. The deal, which is set to close in the third quarter, will open new opportunities for Toku to take its services to the next level.


Synergy: The acquisition will enable Toku to provide a broader range of solutions, which would create “significant opportunities for upselling and cross-selling across our expanded customer base,” says CEO Thomas Laboulle. By acquiring AiChat, Toku can also enhance its existing voice, messaging, and cloud communications suite with a new layer of conversational AI. 

A boost:  Toku has an annual revenue of US$31 million as of 2023. The expanded capabilities and synergies achieved through the acquisition is expected to unlock an estimated 50% revenue boost for AiChat within a year after the purchase. 

What’s next:  Toku will continue to develop AiChat’s existing road map as a standalone product. It also plans to leverage AiChat’s expertise in channels such as WhatsApp, Google Messages, and Line and hopes to be able to develop a “voice bot to scale human-like customer engagement.”

Quick bytes
1️⃣ TikTok on the chopping block
The US Congress has passed a bill mandating TikTok‘s parent company, ByteDance, to sell its US operations in a year or face a complete ban. It was passed despite ByteDance and TikTok collectively shelling out US$7 million on lobbying and ad campaigns.
2️⃣ The Zilingo saga continues
Ankiti Bose, the co-founder and former CEO of fashion ecommerce startup Zilingo, has filed a criminal complaint against fellow founder Dhruv Kapoor and ex-COO Aadi Vaidya.
The complaint alleges that the parties misled Bose and Zilingo’s investors for financial gain and forced her to relinquish her shares under false pretenses. In their statements, both Kapoor and Vaidya call Bose’s allegations “completely baseless and untrue.”
3️⃣ Behind bars
US prosecutors suggested a three-year jail term for Binance founder Changpeng Zhao after he pled guilty to money laundering violations in the country. The decision exceeds federal guidelines, which typically caps the sentence for such crimes at 18 months. Prosecutors feel this is warranted “given the magnitude of Zhao’s willful violation of US law and its consequences.”
4️⃣ Press pause
Chinese AI giant SenseTime briefly paused its stock trading after its share price quickly rose by as much as 36% in Hong Kong on April 25. The surge followed the launch of the fifth and latest version of SenseNova, the company’s large language model, at the company’s Tech Day event in Shanghai.",We explore the potential upsides of customer experience firm Toku’s latest acquisition and look at a GameFi startup founded by Mintable’s ex-COO.,Stefanie Yeo,Edited by Jaclyn Tiu,open,0,"",https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1714028322_Newsletter-GIF-Becoming-something-better-1200x640-1.gif,false,"",false,true,false,true,false,4,,882,"After merger, this startup eyes 50% revenue boost",We explore the potential upsides of customer experience firm Toku’s latest acquisition and look at a GameFi startup founded by Mintable’s ex-COO.,,,"","",""

Animoca Brands appears to have endured 2023’s tumultuous cryptocurrency market. According to unaudited figures up to March 31, 2024, the Hong Kong-based firm holds a cash and stablecoin sum of US$291 million – up from the US$194 million it held as of April 30 last year.
In addition, Animoca said it holds US$558 million in digital assets on its balance sheet. The amount is partly a result of its recent investments and token launch efforts, which the company says bolstered its digital portfolio by US$266 million since December 2023.
About US$1.8 billion worth of token reservoirs outside the balance sheet are with Animoca’s Web3 subsidiairies. However, the company says this does not account for the value of nearly 400 minority investments across other Web3 businesses.
Some of these investments include Singapore-based NFT firm Imaginary Ones, Web3 gaming firm Pixelmon, and multimedia startup Gacha Monsters.
Animoca also announced a strategic partnership with Hong Kong-based Hi Protocol in July 2023, which involved a US$30 million commitment. It also recently expanded its MENA footprint with an investment into Param Labs, a company that specializes in multiplayer blockchain games.
Currently,  Animoca said it is preparing its audited fiscal report for 2021. It aims to release unaudited financial and business updates for fiscal year 2023 in Q2 2024.

ByteDance, TikTok‘s parent company, would choose to close its US operations rather than sell, should it lose its fight against the call to ban the app in the country, Reuters reported, citing sources.
The shared algorithms between TikTok and ByteDance could make selling the app difficult, as their intellectual property is currently registered in China, the people added.
If ByteDance chooses to exit the US, its overall business will be minimally impacted, as TikTok accounts for a small part of the Chinese company’s total revenue and user base, the report noted. It would also enable the company to keep its key algorithm.
Even though TikTok is popular worldwide, it made up only 25% of ByteDance’s total earnings in 2023. Additionally, the short-video app’s daily active users in the US only accounted for 5% of ByteDance’s daily active users globally for that year.
While the US is pressuring ByteDance to sell TikTok due to privacy concerns, Chinese officials suggested in a 2023 hearing that a forced sale would meet opposition from China. The country’s laws, which require following administrative procedures for tech exports – which TikTok’s algorithm would fall under – could also slow down the platform’s sale.

India-based FirstCry, a baby care ecommerce firm, is looking to retract its IPO application following queries from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) on the company’s key metrics, Reuters reported.
FirstCry aimed to raise around US$500 million, which consists of US$215 million from new shares and an extra US$300 million through the sale of existing ones.
SEBI said that FirstCry hasn’t abided by one of its listing rules. It states that a company going public has to disclose all crucial business metrics that could influence potential investors.
To list, FirstCry must disclose numbers such as average order value, yearly transacting customers, and total orders. Because of this, FirstCry is set to withdraw its application, make the necessary changes, and then resubmit the IPO papers.
For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, FirstCry reported a surge in losses to about US$59 million. However, its total revenue more than doubled to US$691 million.
A key driver for the company’s losses in FYE 2023 was its increased spending on advertising and sales promotions, which ballooned more than twofold compared to FYE 2021.

Vietnam, for one, is emerging as a hot market for the sector. In 2023, the country’s edtech scene was an outlier in the face of the ongoing funding winter. It raised over US$30 million in the first half of the year alone, more than what was raised in 2022 as a whole.
Vietnamese citizens are also keen on the benefits that edtech platforms can bring, whether it’s learning a new language, gaining greater exposure to STEM subjects, or upskilling to improve their job prospects.

Neo Zhizhong, co-founder and CEO of Geniebook / Photo credit: Geniebook

To that end, edtech startups from abroad have set their eyes on Vietnam. One such company is Singapore-based Geniebook, which expanded into the county in 2021.
At our upcoming Saigon Summit, Geniebook CEO Neo Zhizhong will be sharing his experience venturing into the Vietnamese market. Ahead of the event, we spoke to him about his perspectives on edtech, Vietnam, and being a founder.
The following interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.
How did Geniebook get started?
Fifteen years ago, my co-founder Alicia and I established a chain of learning centers providing mathematics and science lessons for students from grades one to 10 – typically those between seven and 16 years old – in Singapore. The student base grew swiftly thanks to our unique approach where each topic catered to an individual student’s weaknesses. As the center continued to scale and class sizes increased, personalization became difficult.
This roadblock turned out to be a catalyst for the creation of Geniebook, an education platform that aims to provide students with personalization at scale. Geniebook leverages the combined strength of AI, live and pre-recorded online classes, as well as chatrooms to deliver high-quality education to students across Singapore, Vietnam, and Malaysia. Notably, our platform features a proprietary AI algorithm that uses over 1 million data points to recommend questions to maximise students’ improvement.

Neo with co-founder Alicia Cheong / Photo credit: Geniebook

Our ambition is to scale world-class education in a personalized way. We have been able to provide students with exactly what they need at scale, with hundreds of teachers helping 200,000 students across the region achieve academic excellence.
Why is Vietnam an exciting market for Geniebook?
Vietnam has a young and vibrant demographic, with over 60% of its population under the age of 35. This tech-savvy generation is hungry for high-quality education and readily embraces innovative learning solutions.
The country’s education sector is experiencing a period of rapid growth. The government’s investment in education has increased by 12% annually over the past five years, reflecting a strong national commitment to developing the next generation’s skills.
Moreover, Vietnamese parents are increasingly prioritizing their children’s education. A recent study by the National Centre for Socio-Economic Information and Forecast under the Ministry of Planning and Investment showed that on average, education accounts for 34.7% of total household spending in the country.

Our target segment is parents who aspire to give their children access to world-class education. In Vietnam, we’ve observed that many parents have a strong desire for their children to receive quality education with English as the main mode of instruction. They want their children to be confident in using English in a variety of learning contexts to prepare them for higher education or even the Ivy Leagues. This has guided our strategy as we scale in Vietnam.
Geniebook originated from Singapore, the country with one of the highest quality of education in the world – in fact, Singapore ranks top in the world in the Programme for International Student Assessment. By combining Singapore curricula with AI-powered solutions, we believe Geniebook can become the bridge to international opportunities for students in Vietnam.
How has Geniebook’s expansion into Vietnam been going?
Our initial foray into Vietnam has exceeded our expectations. Here are some highlights:

We’ve had a strong response from students and parents, witnessing a surge in user registrations, indicating a significant demand for our personalized learning approach.
Feedback from students and parents has been positive, with many reporting improved academic performance and increased engagement with the learning materials.
We’ve established strategic collaborations with key educational institutions in the country, further solidifying our presence and commitment to the local education landscape.
We’re experiencing steady revenue growth in Vietnam, demonstrating the market’s receptiveness to our offerings.

While we can’t disclose specific numbers at this stage, the initial results are highly encouraging. We’re actively expanding our team, building strong relationships with local stakeholders, and continuously improving our platform to cater to the specific needs of Vietnamese students.
What is one thing you wish you knew before starting your company?
I wish I knew about the importance of having tough conversations early. Delaying difficult discussions – whether about performance, strategic direction, or conflicts – often compounds problems rather than resolve them. Addressing issues head-on not only clears misunderstandings but also builds trust and fosters transparency.
What will you be speaking about at Tech in Asia’s Saigon Summit and why is it important?
Geniebook started seriously investing in the Vietnam market a few years before media and investor attention really grew. At the Saigon Summit, I’ll be sharing our journey of entering and scaling in the country, why and how we decided to enter Vietnam among other Southeast Asian markets, and the insights we’ve gleaned from our experience.
Vietnam is definitely a promising market, but it’s not without its challenges. I hope that what I’ll be sharing would be of value to other companies looking to enter and grow in Vietnam, and I look forward to learning from my fellow panelists too.

Hear from Zhizhong, as well as a host of other exciting speakers, at Tech in Asia’s upcoming Saigon Summit. Held on May 30 at GEM Center, Ho Chi Minh City, we’re bringing together some of Southeast Asia’s best and brightest to chart Vietnam’s tech future together.

Photo credit: Superbank

Superbank, the Indonesian digital bank backed by Grab and Singtel, has introduced a new savings feature called Celengan. Accessible through its app, the product lets users automatically save a set amount of money every day.
With the feature, which means “piggy bank” in Bahasa Indonesian, users can start saving with as little as US$0.07 a day. The virtual piggy bank will automatically “break” once it reaches US$333.
Celengan also continues a trend from other digibanks in offering a high interest rate at launch. In this case, Superbank is offering 10% per annum, while Akulaku-backed Bank Neo Commerce previously offered 8% and SeaBank at 7%.
Superbank had rebranded from Bank Fama in February 2023. It has since launched financing products such as working capital loans for female entrepreneurs and a US$40 million fund for startups, though – aside from the basics – Celengan appears to be its first consumer-focused offering.
GXS Bank, Singapore’s equivalent for Superbank that Grab and Singtel launched in 2022, has also rolled out a personal savings product, a personal loan product, and a debit card. Separately, the GrabPay Card – which Grab launched with Mastercard in 2019 – will be discontinued from June 2024, a move that will likely benefit GXS.
Meanwhile, GXBank – Grab’s digibank offering in Malaysia – launched in November 2023, making it the country’s first digital bank. Its app offers a targeted savings goals feature called Pockets, which earn daily interest of up to 3% per annum.

Certis was trying to build a security robot, but things were not working out with its vendors. They struggled to find the sweet spot where performance, reliability, and pricing met. Could Patec help?

Image credit: Timmy Loen

The opportunity was intriguing for Wee, who spent most of his life working for the Singapore-based precision engineering company founded by his father. Building robots was not in the ordinary course of business, but Certis’ interest in deploying the technology gave him an inkling that this industry might eventually be critical.
Wee turned out to be right. In the years since, Singapore’s blue-collar workforce has suffered from more personnel shortages and rising labor costs.
Companies are turning to automation. Certis now offers its clients smart security services, including those delivered by two robots designed by Patec’s spin-off company Kabam Robotics. These patrolling robots can detect incidents and feed information back to a virtual platform called the Smart Command Operations Centre.
To build them, Wee sought the help of an old friend working on software development. Together, the team did a series of demos that impressed Certis stakeholders and the board. In December 2020, Certis awarded Patec a purchase order for 45 robots worth about S$4 million (US$2.9 million).
“That was the day we realized that there was probably a business in this,” Wee said. Kabam Robotics was founded shortly after. In 2022, it merged with Cognicept Systems, the startup built by Michael Sayre, Wee’s software business partner.
For decades, the rise of automation has favored industrial robots, commonly found on the factory floor. These robots operate in an environment where conditions are fixed and controlled.
Service robots, on the other hand, are found in free environments with variable conditions and human behavior. A cleaning robot, for example, must know how to navigate through changing crowd conditions in a shopping mall.
The variability makes it tricky to build a robot that is always effective. But developments in technology, such as sensors and vision systems, have helped these machines adapt better to human environments.
Singapore excels at industrial automation, but needs to carve a niche for itself in the field of service robotics.
The country had the second-highest industrial robot density in the world in 2022, research from the International Federation of Robotics shows. It had 730 robots for every 10,000 employees, largely deployed in the manufacturing sector.
But now, Singapore wants to shape the next wave of service robots that augment humans’ work.
National dream
Singapore launched a National Robotics Programme (NRP) in 2016, with more than S$450 million (US$330 million) in funding. NRP, funded by the National Research Foundation, identifies key priorities in robotics and supports participants collaborating across public agencies, research institutes, and the private sector.
The program has invested in over 40 robotics projects involving more than 650 researchers, engineers, and scientists, noted Quek Tong Boon, NRP’s chief executive.
In March, the government announced about S$60 million (US$44 million) in new funding for NRP. The money will go into driving robotics development in sectors such as manufacturing and logistics, facilities management, and healthcare.

Since NRP started, local companies like LionsBot and Hope Technik have made a name for themselves on the international stage.
LionsBot, founded in 2018, has sold over 2,500 of its made-in-Singapore professional cleaning robots to buyers in 30 countries. On April 18, it launched its 4,908-square-meter factory in Singapore’s Kranji area, with an investment of S$12 million (US$8.8 million).
The new factory has five times the manufacturing capacity of its previous one in Changi. The expansion to Kranji has bumped up LionsBot’s manufacturing output to up to 4,000 robots annually. Its CEO Dylan Ng said that with further automation in the future, the new facility will be able to produce up to 20,000 robots.
NRP’s Quek said, “We never expected that, by the time the first phase of our program ended, we would see robots catalyzed by us in the midst of the environment in Singapore.
“Given our labor crunch, it was inevitable that we would be a user of robots. So we asked ourselves: ‘Can we go beyond just being a user? Can we try to influence this development? Can we make money out of it?’”
Today, robots are being tested across Singapore. In a trial that ended in February, one called “Aiden” navigated narrow pathways and lifts to deliver meals to frail seniors living in rental flats in Queenstown.

At Gardens by the Bay, drones built by the Singapore University of Technology and Design hose down the Supertrees with water – a safer and faster way to clean these high structures without endangering human workers.
The local industry is benefiting from the global adoption of service robots. Worldwide sales of such robots grew by 48% in 2022, when nearly 158,000 units were sold, research from the International Federation of Robotics shows.
The entire robotics industry, including industrial robots, is projected to be worth US$65.6 billion by 2028, according to a report from Statista. Service robots are expected to dominate market volume, growing about 11% annually from 2024 to 2028.

Twists and turns
Robot fever has caught on in the public markets. South Korea’s biggest IPO in 2023 came from Doosan Robotics, whose robots serve beer, prepare coffee, and deep-fry chicken. On April 17, shares of the company were up 63.4% from their IPO price, closing at 71,100 won (US$51.5).
UBTech Robotics, China’s biggest manufacturer of educational and humanoid robots, debuted on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in December 2023. Its shares have nearly doubled from their IPO price of HK$90 (US$11.5), giving the company a market value of around HK$69 billion (US$8.8 billion).
But not everyone is getting their moment in the sun. The shares of Roomba maker iRobot have plunged more than 80% this year, after a US$1.4 billion buyout by Amazon failed to get past European Union (EU) regulators.
The deal’s demise left iRobot tackling plunging revenue, soaring losses and a heavy debt pile. The company laid off 31% of staff shortly after.
Most robotics companies fail to even make it to the public markets.
Lyon Poh, technology consulting partner at KPMG in Singapore, said, “Achieving financial sustainability requires a multifaceted approach.
“It means optimizing costs through streamlined production processes and operational efficiency, while diversifying revenue streams with different pricing models and fostering long-term partnerships for recurring revenue.”
Securing funding is a challenge for robotics startups as well. Venture capitalists have mostly preferred software startups for their scalability and ability to pivot quickly. Robotics outfits, on the other hand, need a heavier investment in assets and a longer runway to mass commercialization.
This makes it difficult to invest using a typical seven-year horizon, said Goh Chew Lam, director at Blue InCube Ventures. He and his partners invest out of a personal pool of capital – unlike VC funds with a fund life.
Some investors have unrealistic expectations of returns, which puts founders under pressure to deliver those kinds of returns by chasing aggressive strategies, he said.
In China, some startups ended up overvalued. “It forces startups to try to grow into the valuation,” Goh said.
Instead, companies should focus on providing value to their customers and finding real problems to solve. Goh cited the example of the tray-return robot deployed across Singapore food centers in 2021, in line with a campaign by the National Environment Agency.
“That was a good attempt – but a wrong problem. Once the fine for encouraging people to return their tray came in, there was no need for those robots.”
Staying the course
Robot makers’ headaches extend beyond capital constraints. Despite efforts to get robots to adapt, the effectiveness of service robots still depends on their physical environment and willingness of companies to adopt the technology.
Among 100 restaurants evaluating the use of robots, 10 would think these machines suitable, based on the layout of the place, said William Dai, founder of robot distributor Ourglass Robotics.
“Five of the 10 are probably willing to pay for it; three to four out of the five would have issues related to workflow, grants, internal resistance, or other priorities.
“In the end, only one or two will purchase a robot, out of 100 restaurants,” he said.
But Dai remains optimistic about the industry. Sales of Ourglass’ food delivery robots spiked during the pandemic; today, the company has nearly 300 robots serving customers in Singapore, including those in the Din Tai Fung restaurant chain.
Enquiries have fallen about 80% from two years ago, but he still sees room for growth. Ourglass plans to expand into healthcare, security, and data centers with new robots.
Ling Ting Ming, CEO of robotics company Otsaw, believes organizations are becoming more receptive of robots. Armed with data gathered from tracking a robot’s work in a typical 800-bedder hospital, he visited several facilities in Germany, one of the top markets for robotics.
“When I talk to C-level executives in the hospitals, I say: ‘Do you know that every day, you are making your staff run six marathons and carry 30 elephants in the hospital?’”
That line often got his customers interested.

Otsaw’s robots, which are used across various industries, are priced from US$20,000 to US$80,000, depending on the project requirements.
“Looking ahead, we’re intensifying our global sales efforts to expand our network of resellers, with a primary objective of capturing a larger market share in both the EU and the US,” said Ling.
Other parts of the robotics supply chain are maturing as well. NRP estimates that there are over 250 companies in the local robotics industry, including systems integrators and charging technology companies.
One of them, a startup called Factorem, helps robot makers overcome the issue of needing high-quality, affordable parts in low quantities to build prototypes. Factorem co-founder Alexandra Zhang said robotics startups often have trouble finding a reliable supplier, or getting their requests prioritized.
Low-volume prototyping and production often takes two to three months, she noted. Factorem uses AI to provide market prices, and matches order requests to the best supplier who can take the job, reducing fulfillment times.
“It enables efficient transactions, even for a single piece part. It is a seamless way to order custom-manufactured parts in seconds, and get them on-demand in days,” she said.
AI-deas for the future?
Increasing adoption of robots has prompted the industry to think deeper about the intersection between real-world environments, hardware, and software. For instance, a robot transporting a sick patient meets a robot carrying linens – who gets priority to pass?
And if each robot is from a different manufacturer, how do they communicate with each other? Or with building facilities?
Singapore has been developing the Robotics Middleware Framework, a software layer that enables different robot types to coordinate their actions. This framework helped strengthen Kabam Robotics’ management platform Smart+, which facilitates seamless communication between robots, building infrastructure and back-end systems.
Recent leaps in AI have sparked interest in how the technology could be used in robotics. Last month, Nvidia announced Project Gr00t, a general-purpose foundation model for humanoid robots. The AI model helps robots understand natural language and emulate movements by observing human actions.
Industry players in Singapore are exploring the use of AI, though real efficiency may still be years away.
Sharon Ng, a Nanyang Business School professor who has studied the relationship between humans and robots, said AI could help encourage mass commercialization of robots.
One barrier to adoption has been a robot’s lack of ability to adapt to situational and individual needs, she said.
Research has shown that patients are reluctant to be operated on by robot surgeons because they don’t think that these machines can understand their individual uniqueness, she added.
“I think the day when the robots can adapt to idiosyncratic needs will be the day we see greater adoption.”

Refocus, an edtech company operating in the Philippines and Indonesia, is facing a lawsuit from 843 of its students in Indonesia. The lawsuit, which was filed with the South Jakarta District Court, claims damages of approximately US$990,000 for material losses and another US$619,000 for non-material damages.
The students allege that despite paying for services, they did not receive full access to educational content or the employment guarantees promised by Refocus, which trains people in key IT skills and helps them find tech jobs.
The startup’s status in Indonesia is currently unclear. In the Philippines, Refocus suspended operations in July 2023 while facing complaints about its sales and marketing tactics.
Two months later, the company abruptly halted operations in Indonesia, leaving many students with significant financial losses. The fees they paid range from approximately US$1,114 to US$1,485.
On its Indonesia website, however, Refocus posted a message saying that while the company faced “some significant financial challenges,” it is now “on the path to revival.”
The Indonesia lawsuit is now at a critical juncture, as the court has issued a final summons to Refocus. If the company fails to respond, the court may rule in favor of the plaintiffs by default.
While Refocus does not have any disclosed funding rounds on the Tech in Asia database, it previously said that it was looking to raise US$10 million in 2023. It also claimed to have earned US$8.5 million in revenue the year prior.

Apart from ruling that there were no grounds for shuttering the crypto firm, Judicial Commissioner Alex Wong added during the court hearing that it was not appropriate for Chua to seek liquidation as a quick fix to his troubles when there were other remedies available.

This puts an end to the current legal battle between Cake Group’s warring founders, Chua and CEO Julian Hosp, that began in December 2023.
Judicial Commissioner Wong, however, stressed that his order in no way endorses Hosp’s behavior as detailed in Chua’s claim. He urged the co-founders to resolve the conflict with a considered and careful approach, on the account that they have built a value-adding enterprise together.
So why did Chua not have sufficient grounds for liquidating Cake Group?
Here is a play-by-play of the commissioner’s response to Chua’s claims:

Chua and Hosp were not physically present at the hearing. But Hosp joined Cake Group’s staff at the High Court after the judgment was passed, sharing cheers of relief and then going off to celebrate.
“Today is a happy day for the Cake Group, our customers, and our talented team,” tweeted Hosp on X. “With this decision, the uncertainty for customers, team members, and partners ends today… onwards and upwards.”
Chua tells Tech in Asia that he was not expecting this outcome.”We’re back to square one,” he says.
“We definitely can’t work with each other anymore. We mutually agreed last September that one of us has to leave,” Chua adds.

Where does Chua go from here? There are no definitive steps yet, but he is looking at several ways forward, such as filing for an appeal against the commissioner’s order. He could also work with Hosp to find an amicable way out, which includes Hosp buying him out and fully taking over the company.
In a previous hearing on February 28, Hosp offered to sell his stake in the firm, however, the deal didn’t materialize.
While Chua does not rule out selling his shares to a third party, he says that he has tried doing so before and it was tough.
As for being bought out by Hosp, Chua is uncertain about such an arrangement. “We’ve tried so many times, but [our attempts] kept failing in the past six months.”
The falling out between the two co-founders began in October 2023 over disagreements about the layoffs at Cake Group.

After Ola, FirstCry, and MobiKwik, foodtech decacorn Swiggy will be the latest tech company to join India’s IPO pipeline. A new regulatory filing shows that the firm has obtained shareholder approval to raise US$1.25 billion in its stock market debut.
Out of that amount, US$450 million will come from new shares, while the remaining US$800 million will come from existing investors offloading their shares. However, the company has not filed IPO documents with the Securities and Exchange Board of India.
It is also planning to raise roughly US$90 million from anchor investors in a pre-IPO round, The Economic Times reported.
Swiggy was valued at over US$10.7 billion in early 2022, with that figure now exceeding US$12 billion, according to some investors. It holds nearly half of India’s food delivery market share.
The company’s gross merchandise value for 2023 was US$2.6 billion, with its services available across over 600 Indian cities. It employs around 375,000 delivery staff and sees 16 to 17 million users transacting monthly.
Though profitable, Swiggy faces stiff competition, especially in the quick commerce space. Main rival Zomato boosted its market standing in the sector by buying Blinkit in 2022, though both companies face challenges from Zepto.

Nvidia is set to acquire Israel-based AI startup Run:ai, the US chipmaker said in a statement. While Nvidia didn’t disclose the acquisition’s value, Israeli outlet Calcalist pegs the number at around US$700 million.
Run:ai develops software to help businesses manage their computing needs more effectively. It runs on Kubernetes, an open-source system designed by Google that automates software deployment, scaling, and management.
In a statement, Nvidia noted the “increasingly complex” customer AI deployments as a reason behind the deal. With the acquisition, the chipmaker aims to make it easier for customers to access and manage GPU solutions, expecting to see better GPU use, improved management of GPU infrastructure, and more flexibility due to an open architecture system.
Nvidia plans to keep Run:ai’s current business model for now, with Calcalist reporting that Run:ai staff will join the chipmaker’s R&amp;D center in Israel, where it employs about 3,000 people. Run:ai’s upcoming products will also be included in Nvidia’s DGX Cloud, an AI platform that works with top cloud providers to serve enterprise developers.
This continues Nvidia’s investment streak for the year. In January, it joined the US$150 million round of no-code platform Kore.ai. Earlier this month, it co-invested US$200 million each for an AI center in Indonesia and an AI factory in Vietnam.
Meanwhile, Run:ai has raised US$118 million in disclosed funding since its 2018 founding. Its latest financing is a US$75 million series C round co-led by Tiger Global in March 2022.

ShopBack has extended its cashback and rewards services to New Zealand. Co-founder Joel Leong announced on LinkedIn that the company is introducing a dedicated mobile app and website specifically designed for Kiwi users.
New Zealand is an extension of ShopBack’s current services in the Australian market. This extension of services includes partnerships with nearly 200 local merchants and brands, offering exclusive deals and enhanced cashback payout options to New Zealand banks, wrote Leong.
The development provides a bright spot for the Singapore-headquartered company after a 20% drop in annual revenue to US$87.7 million for the fiscal year ended March 2023. Its losses before taxes also increased 29% compared to the previous year, though it was due largely to one-time costs associated with staff payments and business mergers.
Notably, the Temasek-backed company cut 24% of its workforce, or 195 people, last month in an effort to streamline operations and ensure long-term viability. The same month, it announced the shutdown of its buy now, pay later service, effective March 22.
According to Tech in Asia‘s database, ShopBack has raised US$331.1 million in disclosed funding. It last raised US$30 million from Australian bank Westpac in late 2022, which brought ShopBack’s total series F round to US$200 million.

Global fintech firm Airwallex has launched its payment acceptance services in the US. The move comes a year after the firm launched in Canada, China, and Israel and after it acquired a fintech firm in Mexico.
This lets US businesses use Airwallex to accept both domestic and international payments, while foreign companies with operations in the country can provide local payment options to customers there. For instance, cross-border merchants can offer payment methods like Klarna and PayPal, which are popular in the US, but also offer options like GrabPay in one go.
“The opportunity we’re delivering is twofold: helping US companies tap into a global customer base and helping businesses around the world access the massive US market,” said Ravi Adusumili, Airwallex’s executive general manager of the Americas, in a statement.
Airwallex, which is now active in 35 countries, has also seen rapid growth in its Singapore operations. Revenue for its entity in the city-state increased 13x while transaction volumes rose 11x in the first half of 2023 compared to the previous year, though the company did not disclose dollar amounts.
Founded in Melbourne in 2015 by Jack Zhang and Max Li, Airwallex’s offerings include global account issuance, domestic and cross-border money transfers, multicurrency wallets, and online payment acceptance.
According to Tech in Asia‘s database, the firm has raised US$1.1 billion in disclosed funding from investors like Tencent, Sequoia Capital, and Salesforce Ventures.

The buy now, pay later (BNPL ) space showed some signs of trouble recently, but it appears to have found new momentum. GoTo and TikTok Shop are looking to launch a BNPL service, and Southeast Asia’s BNPL payments volume may reach US$232.5 billion in 2024.
Now Philippine BNPL provider BillEase has secured a US$5 million investment from Saison Investment Management Private Limited (SIMPL), part of Japan’s Credit Saison.
The funding adds to BillEase’s existing credit facility, which the company says has reached US$40 million. BillEase had raised US$20 million from Helicap back in 2022.
Founded by former McKinsey executives, BillEase initially ran only a BNPL service. Now it also offers personal loans, gaming credits, and e-wallet top-ups through its platform. With the fresh funds, the firm plans to grow its loan portfolio and launch new credit products.
Last year, the company doubled its revenue to US$57 million and maintained profitability with a net income of US$7 million – up from US$1.5 million the previous year.
The startup previously said that it was preparing for a series C funding round, having raised its last equity funding – a US$11 million series B round – two years ago. Recently, BillEase also partnered with Razer Fintech to offer installment payment options to merchants within the latter’s network.

845644,2024-04-25T04:00:45,2024-04-29T01:33:14,"Demystifying Yuu, the Temasek-backed consumer loyalty program",demystifying-yuu-temasekbacked-consumer-loyalty-program,publish,post,https://www.techinasia.com/demystifying-yuu-temasekbacked-consumer-loyalty-program,"“I want nobody, nobody but Yuu,” croons Singaporean comedian Gurmit Singh to the tune of the K-pop hit “Nobody.”
In Singapore, nothing catches the attention of citizens quite like a catchy tune by the personality, who plays the titular character in local sitcom Phua Chu Kang.

Image credit: Timmy Loen

During the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, Singh reminded Singaporeans to “wash your hands whenever you can” in a now iconic rap. When the Covid-19 pandemic hit in 2020, he again made a public service announcement through song, reminding Singaporeans to “wear a mask if you are sick.”
So when Singh sings “come, let’s earn points with Yuu, it’s so easy with Yuu,” the publicity stunt had the hallmark of another government effort to galvanize action – only this time, it was for a consumer rewards program.
The marketing blitz paid off.
As of March 2024, Yuu has over 1.6 million registered members. The app also has over 1 million monthly active users in Singapore – over 15% of the population – and has been downloaded almost 1.2 million times, according to market intelligence platform Sensor Tower.

Is Yuu a government-backed initiative designed to become a commercially viable national loyalty program? Or is it a multimillion-dollar experiment by state-owned investment firm Temasek on an “emerging” technology that might benefit its other endeavors?
A first glance suggests the former: Yuu is the product of Minden.ai, a joint venture between Temasek and Hong Kong-based DFI Retail Holdings. The latter is the owner and operator of supermarket chains Cold Storage and Giant as well as convenience store 7-Eleven in Singapore.
Some of the city-state’s largest blue chip companies, including Singtel and DBS are Yuu partners. The latter even co-branded a DBS Yuu card through which users can earn added cash rebates.
Mandai Wildlife Reserve – the operator of the Singapore zoo and a Temasek investee – is also a Yuu partner.
Regulatory filings by Minden International – the sole shareholder in Minden Singapore, Yuu’s operating entity in the city-state – show that Minden Holdings is its largest shareholder, owning S$50.2 million (US$36.9 million) in ordinary shares. DFI Development Holdings is Yuu’s second majority shareholder, with S$33.5 million (US$24.6 million) in ordinary shares.
Why the need for Yuu?
On the surface, the Yuu rewards club appears to be another loyalty program seeking to address a fragmented rewards space, where retailers operate their respective rewards programs in isolation.
Members of Yuu earn points when they spend at Yuu partner stores, which range from eateries, supermarkets, to tourist attractions. The points can in turn be used to offset purchases or redeem cash vouchers and other rewards.
However, Yuu isn’t Temasek’s first stab at the consumer rewards space. In 2021, Temasek was part of a group of investors that poured US$40 million into ShopBack, the shopping rewards and cashback platform.
In 2022, 65 Equity Partners – an investment firm backed by Temasek – sunk another US$80 million into ShopBack’s series F round.
Why then is Temasek backing two horses in the same race? With Yuu, the idea was to build a “data-intensive” loyalty system that was more comprehensive than standard loyalty programs, says a person familiar with Yuu.

Many run-of-the-mill loyalty systems stop short of gathering data on what items customers are buying, and only capture the total dollar amount of what a customer has spent at a retailer. This, however, limits the extent to which these rewards programs can be personalized to each customer.
“The value of knowing that you spent US$50 a month at a supermarket doesn’t really help a lot. But if I [know] that every week you buy a carton of Coca-Cola – that changes the value of the loyalty system – because then I know you’re a Coke fan, and we’ll target you differently,” the person explains.
With no such software available on the market that can be used at multiple retailers across categories – and that could track the sales of items on an individualized or stock-keeping unit (SKU) level – Temasek sought to build its own, notes the person, who spoke to Tech in Asia on the condition of anonymity.
While Minden.ai says that Yuu uses “machine learning and artificial intelligence” to “enrich relationships” between brands and consumers, the source notes that the rewards platform is admittedly “more data than AI.” That said, the person shares that the data component of Yuu is “very strong.”
A Minden.ai spokesperson tells Tech in Asia that its network of brands is “unrivaled among loyalty programs [in Singapore] in terms of its strength, appeal, and value to customers,” citing the ease of earning and redeeming rewards across the coalition in a single currency (Yuu points).
“We ultimately see AI playing a pivotal role in delivering a hyperpersonalized consumer experience” that helps businesses engage consumers with the “right information at the right time,” the spokesperson adds, though they did not specify examples.
A costly bet
Yuu’s huge marketing blitz has entailed significant costs so far.
According to ACRA filings, Minden Singapore made a net loss of US$13.5 million in its financial year ending March 2023 against a revenue of US$2.6 million. It was the first financial year in which the firm reported revenue, since its incorporation in September 2021.
During its 2023 financial year, the company also spent US$4.2 million on advertising and marketing expenses and US$11.2 million on management fees.

Its filings also reveal that its biggest source of revenue is its “program contribution” fee, presumably from members that pay to be a part of the program.
Its other sources of revenue are breakage, which the company defines as loyalty points that are issued but not redeemed and expire, and loyalty point margin, the value of its points net the costs of providing those benefits.
Minden.ai declined to comment on questions relating to the firm’s financials.
Many loyalty coalition programs before Yuu have come and gone. Plenti, a loyalty coalition by American Express that sought to let cardholders earn rewards from companies like AT&amp;T, Expedia, Chilli’s, and Macy’s, ended in 2018 after a brief three-year run.
Reasons for Plenti’s closure were varied but included a confusing rewards system, conflicting agendas, and partners eventually bowing out.
“Honestly, I think [Temasek] is doing this as part of a broader incubation and customer relationship management or payments strategy. I don’t see this as a real business that’s built to compete with the incumbents,” notes a founder of a Temasek-backed startup.
Loyalty and rewards are a good entry point into payments and could drive cashless adoption in Singapore, the founder adds.
Minden.ai, meanwhile, hasn’t ruled out an overseas expansion. While DFI Retail Holdings operates the Yuu rewards club in Hong Kong, both rewards programs operate independently, a Minden.ai spokesperson says.
The spokesperson adds that the firm is “open to attractive opportunities in other regional markets.”
One merchant per category
Any coalition program, however, has a growth ceiling. Trust among coalition partners – an essential component – could threaten to break down the more the coalition grows, limiting how much it can scale.
Direct competition or perceptions over who enjoys a larger share of benefits from the program – can also breed tension among members.

Partners of Yuu rewards club include DBS, Singtel, the BreadTalk Group, and Mandai Wildlife Reserve. / Photo credit: Minden.ai

In Yuu’s case, trust is maintained by limiting membership to only one merchant per category, a source familiar with Yuu says. DBS, Singtel, Cold Storage, and BreadTalk, for instance, don’t directly compete with one another.
But adding a rival supermarket would be a different question. Adding NTUC Fairprice – Singapore’s largest supermarket chain – when Cold Storage and Giant are already part of the alliance, for instance, “would be a big no-no,” the person notes.
Adding competing members to the alliance would also make existing partners unwilling to share any data on their own customers, including what products they’re buying, for fear that competitors might get a hold of the information.
Assuming the “one merchant per category” rule has to be maintained, this would rule out Yuu ever becoming a “national” loyalty program of sorts, though it could certainly become the most dominant player.
Going head to head
In September 2023, food delivery platform Foodpanda, ride-hailing firm Gojek, and insurance firm Great Eastern joined Yuu, bringing the total number of its partner brands to 18.
In recent months, Yuu appears to have also added online merchants to the mix, a signal of its intentions to grow beyond physical retail.
Users earn points when they click through to sites of sportswear brands Nike and JD Sports, as well as fast fashion retailer H&amp;M and Cotton On, and complete their purchases.
It’s worth noting that this is similar to ShopBack’s affiliate marketing model of directing users to partner sites. Already, several Yuu partners, including Guardian, Nike, H&amp;M, and JD Sports, overlap with ShopBack’s merchant pool.
Could Yuu increasingly encroach on the playground of its rival, whose board consists of both Temasek and 65 Equity Partners executives? Would it be inefficient to have two Temasek-backed companies compete against one another?
The founder of a Temasek-backed firm, however, defends the state fund, noting that it doesn’t make centralized investment decisions or oversee investments made by its general partner investors, including SeaTown Holdings, 65 Equity Partners, and Vertex Ventures.
For instance, the Temasek executives that invested in the source’s company aren’t the same executives that approve the investments made by its associated funds. “They don’t sit on the investment committees of those funds,” the person adds.
A Temasek spokesperson declined to comment.
In an interview with The Business Times in March, Nagi Hamiyeh, Temasek’s head of Europe, Middle East, and Africa stressed that there is a “clear delineation” between Temasek’s role as a shareholder and board member, in instances where Temasek gets a board seat at its portfolio companies.
Is Yuu an experiment, then?
If a national loyalty program isn’t the answer, is Yuu an experiment by Temasek on cutting-edge tech, then?
Unlike areas of strategic importance, like infrastructure, banking, clean energy, or emerging technologies like blockchain or AI, a consumer loyalty program doesn’t appear to be a breakthrough technology.
Minden Singapore’s sizable losses in the 12 months ending March 2023 raise the question of whether the firm was intended to be a profit-making entity, though this depends on whether its revenues would grow substantially in the future.

In any investment decision that Temasek makes, the purpose is to achieve the best sustainable returns, Hamiyeh said in the The Business Times interview.
Minden.ai was started and funded by Temasek’s AI pod, one of two experimental teams formed to create new ventures and take them to market.
Unlike investing in or buying over companies, venture building provides the “institutional heft and support” needed to accelerate growth in “big, bold areas” like blockchain and AI, Pradyumna Agrawal, managing director for blockchain investments at Temasek, told Tech in Asia previously.
Temasek is no stranger to venture building, as it directly operates 15 startups, based on Tech in Asia’s last count.
This model gives Temasek greater control over the outcomes of these startups, compared to a pure capital injection, Song Hwee Chia, deputy CEO at Temasek International, said.

Temasek’s Hamiyeh, in another interview, noted previously the importance of the “indirect uplift in value” that its ecosystem of investments can get from each other. For example, tourists brought to Singapore via Singapore Airlines can use Singtel’s mobile network and visit attractions operated by Mandai Wildlife Reserves.
For now, Minden.ai’s future plans for Yuu aren’t immediately clear. A spokesperson did not respond to Tech in Asia’s questions on how it intends to use Yuu data on customers and their spending patterns or whether other portfolio companies will benefit from it.
Some of Temasek’s portfolio companies, however, are sanguine about how Yuu could benefit them down the line.
Data gleaned on Yuu users, for instance, could “enrich” what other Temasek-backed companies already understand about individual customers and provide a more targeted experience to the consumers, says the founder of the Temasek portfolio company cited earlier.
Companies under the state fund’s umbrella could also extend loans to specific customers directly through the Yuu app or by sending targeted push notifications. At present, Yuu doesn’t offer loan products.
“Incubation is tough – it takes a lot of time, resourcing, and high-level and low-level buy-in. Not to say it cannot be done,” the person adds.

SenseTime CEO and board chairman Xu Li / Photo Credit: SenseTime

Chinese AI giant SenseTime briefly paused its stock trading after its share price quickly rose by as much as 36% in Hong Kong today, Bloomberg reported.
The surge followed the launch of the fifth and latest version of SenseNova, the company’s large language model (LLM), at the company’s Tech Day event in Shanghai. According to SenseTime CEO Xu Li, this version is comparable to or even better than Open AI’s ChatGPT-4.
Li said that SenseNova 5.0 matches or exceeds GPT-4 Turbo in its knowledge, reasoning, mathematical skills, and coding capacity. The LLM can now support the education and content industries, and aid in finance and data analysis, he added.
The SenseNova Edge-side LLM, the latest iteration of the enterprise version of SenseNova, was also introduced during the event.
Since its founding in 2014, SenseTime has earned recognition for its facial recognition tech, a major part of China’s surveillance system. It has since invested heavily in developing its AI capabilities.
These investments were made despite China’s regulatory clampdown on the industry. In August 2023, the Chinese government mandated AI service developers to register their platforms with regulators and agree to security reviews.
Despite greater government scrutiny, the country’s tech giants have continued to develop LLMs that can compete with OpenAI’s ChatGPT.
Just last week, Baidu said that Ernie Bot, its LLM service, had reached 200 million users 13 months after its launch.

Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao / Photo credit: Coinpedia

US prosecutors suggested a three-year jail term for Binance founder Changpeng Zhao after he pled guilty to money laundering violations in the country, Reuters reported.
The decision exceeds federal guidelines, which typically caps the sentence for such crimes at 18 months.
“Given the magnitude of Zhao’s willful violation of US law and its consequences, an above-guidelines sentence of 36 months is warranted,” US prosecutors said in a Washington court.
The decision was revealed in a court filing about a week before Zhao was to be sentenced, the report noted.
In November 2023, Zhao agreed to step down as CEO of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange and agreed to pay a total of US$4.2 billion as a fine to the US Department of Justice for the firm’s violations.
The penalty includes a US$1.8 billion criminal fine and restitution of US$2.5 billion.
Binance, the cryptocurrency exchange that Zhao founded in 2017, was accused of ignoring over 100,000 potentially fraudulent transactions.
Authorities linked these transactions to terrorist outfits like Hamas, al Qaeda, and Isis. They also implicated Binance in facilitating the sale of child exploitation materials.
Zhao remains free in the US thanks to a US$175 million bond as he awaits his sentence on April 30.
Just last month, Zhao launched a new project called Giggle Academy. It offers free courses on math, science, and finance, with an “adaptive individualized curriculum.”
“Building a high-quality and sticky education platform that is entirely free and accessible to all is the most impactful thing I could do for the next chapter of my life,” Zhao wrote on the Giggle Academy website.

Ankiti Bose, the co-founder and former CEO of fashion ecommerce startup Zilingo, has filed a criminal complaint against fellow founder Dhruv Kapoor and ex-COO Aadi Vaidya, the Times of India reports.
Bose, who was fired in mid-2022 following allegations of financial irregularities, claims that Kapoor and Vaidya misled her and Zilingo’s investors for financial gain. She also alleges that her two colleagues forced her to relinquish her shares under false pretenses.
In their statements, both Kapoor and Vaidya call Bose’s allegations “completely baseless and untrue.”
“A thorough investigation has already proven her wrongdoing, based on which she was terminated from the company. This appears to be nothing but retaliatory behavior,” says Kapoor. “Throughout my tenure at Zilingo, I upheld my integrity by aiding the board’s inquiry into Ankiti’s misconduct while fostering professional relationships and striving to build ethical products.”
“This seems like nothing but a clear afterthought done with a malicious intention to harm my reputation and harass me,” says Vaidya.
Meanwhile, a source close to Zilingo echoes Kapoor’s statement, saying that Bose’s lawsuit is “retaliation” against her co-founder as well as Vaidya, as both executives were the whistleblowers that brought to light Zilingo’s many issues.
In her complaint, Bose says that Vaidya “falsely” attributed loss-making deals to her and used them to falsely implicate her to Zilingo’s investors. Meanwhile, Kapoor and Vaidya were “sneaky and shady” in hiding company data from her, she alleges.
She also claims that Vaidya blamed her for errors “to fraudulently acquire my shares, which are valued at multiple crores.”
This is not the first time that Bose has leveled accusations against Kapoor and Vaidya. After being suspended from Zilingo in 2022, the former CEO said that both colleagues failed to help her when she was facing harassment.
Bose was sacked months later, but she teamed up with Kapoor on a management buyout plan that did not come to fruition.
This development is the latest chapter in the long-running Zilingo saga. Vaidya, who is now advising startups in Berlin, had resigned from Zilingo on July 2022, while Kapoor’s LinkedIn profile says he left by December 2022.
Zilingo, which was a soonicorn at one point, began liquidation proceedings in January 2023. According to Tech in Asia‘s database, it has raised US$306.9 million from investors like PeakXV Partners, Temasek Holdings, and EDBI.

Hello reader,
The hardest lessons usually stick with us the strongest.
When we lose a job, when an investment doesn’t work out, or when we burn a bridge – these experiences yield lessons that last a lifetime. And we’d better learn from those setbacks; otherwise, we’ll be doomed to repeat them.
It seems Pakistan’s startup ecosystem has digested a tough lesson or two. As today’s premium piece explores, startups that expected funding to keep flowing like it did a few years ago have fallen by the wayside, while those that focused on saner unit economics have stuck around.
Today we look at:


The Pakistan startup ecosystem’s defining test 
How BNPL gave Atome Financial a solid 2023
Other newsy highlights such as Khazanah Nasional’s new fund for SEA startups and why fintech startup Bambu shuttered despite moving towards profit


Premium summary
Lessons learned in Pakistan

Image credit: Timmy Loen

VC funding for startups in Pakistan reached a high of US$352 million in 2021, but that figure fell to just US$75.6 million in 2023.
The global VC winter and internal crises have hit local startups hard, but the contraction of the ecosystem can be turned into a positive.


Perfect storm: The funding glut of 2021 drove a lot of startups to scale fast and worry about profitability later, following the Silicon Valley playbook. When foreign VCs left the market in droves a year later amid the global tech winter and Pakistan-focused VCs keyed in on unit economics, some startups such as ride-hailing firm Airlift failed to raise money and eventually died. 

Eyes on the prize: Those still standing zeroed in on sensible unit economics, which VCs still investing in Pakistan market value highly. Fintech firms, in particular, have thrived, thanks to the cheaper operating expenses in the country and positive moves in the regulatory environment.

Risk mitigation: Amid Pakistan’s economic slump, local founders are baking risk mitigation into their models. Some sell abroad in stronger markets like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Others focus on hyperlocal innovation instead of simply trying to replicate business models that have worked overseas, which many did burning the funding glut.

News spotlight
Atome Financial’s awesome year

Image credit: Timmy Loen

2023 was a banner year for Atome Financial, as the digital services provider’s operating income ballooned to US$170 million from US$88 million.
Leading the way to profits was Atome, the firm’s buy now, pay later arm.


BNPL bonanza: Atome recorded nearly US$1.5 billion in gross merchandise volume (GMV) – a 40% jump for the BNPL arm from 2022. This increase in transactions resulted in a 130% revenue bump, moving Atome into profit.

Growth story: The firm attributed this GMV growth to improved efficiency, streamlined processes, and expanded trade partnerships. Tie-ups with ecommerce platforms like TikTok Shop and Lazada also helped Atome boost its revenue.

Comeback: Atome Financial says it turned EBITDA positive in the first quarter of this year. This comes after recent struggles for the firm, which laid off staff in Indonesia in 2022 and exited Vietnam in 2023.

Jiawen Ngeow was COO at Mintable, an NFT marketplace backed by billionaire investor Mark Cuban, before leaving amid a legal battle with the company’s CEO. Now, Ngeow has founded Uncharted, a Web3 gaming startup that has just raised US$1.7 million in seed funding.
Shima Capital led the round, which saw participation from The Spartan Group, Double Peak Group, Devmons, and 32-bit. Uncharted’s angel investors also include the three founders of Immutable, Zynga’s Justin Waldron, and Ronin co-founder Aleksander Larson.
Uncharted will use the new funds to expand its GameFi ecosystem, adding that its debut game, Gangster Arena, generated 150 ether (US$486,000) in its first season. The company is now launching Gangster Arena 2 and strategizing for future development.
Ngeow had left Mintable – whose other backers include Animoca Brands, prominent angel investor Koh Boon Hwee’s CRC Capital, and now-defunct Three Arrows Capital – in January 2023. The turmoil at Mintable began in 2022, when it continuously posted losses and reduced revenues amid a declining interest in NFTs, with sales of the digital tokens hitting a 12-month low in June of that year.
This resulted in multiple legal challenges from Ngeow, CEO Zach Burks, CFO Chui Bond, as well as ex-board members Jeremy Khoo and Adam Gartenberg. The executives were fighting over control of Mintable’s operations and a funding deal with private equity fund Nepstone that ultimately went south.
Initially, Mintable Burks wanted to enter the Ethereum trading space in an effort to turn things around for the company, board member Jeremy Khoo said in his affidavit. But Burks needed investors to agree before doing so, which they reportedly did not.
Burks, who is still CEO at the company, filed a lawsuit in January 2023 after Mintable’s series B round collapsed, with Ngeow named as defendant along with board members Khoo and Adam Gartenberg. Ngeow countersued in September 2023, and both parties reached a settlement by December.
While Cuban had even asked Burks at one point to “do the right thing” and step down, the CEO still lists himself as Mintable’s founder on his LinkedIn page.

Fundraising is hard. We’ve compiled a list of funds raised by VCs in Southeast Asia and India to make things slightly easier for our subscribers. If you run a startup or know someone who does, you can find active funds on this regularly updated list.
This is the latest version of the article that was previously updated on April 2, 2023.
Before we dive in, here are some caveats about the data:

The funds raised or closed are disclosed capital commitments from limited partners and don’t indicate money received by the VC.
Data excludes venture debt, private equity funds, hedge funds, family office funds, venture debt funds, or grants.
The funds included have achieved first or initial close. It doesn’t include funds that have just been launched.
VC funds tracked are from January 2021 onwards.

“There’s enough dry power in the startup ecosystem” is a sentiment that comes up often in conversations with VCs in Southeast Asia and India.
Despite economic headwinds, investors are flush with funds. In fact, VCs targeting Southeast Asia and India had raised record amount of over US$$13 billion in 2023, as per Tech in Asia‘s data from publicly listed sources.

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Southeast Asia-focused VCs raised over US$7.1 billion across 39 funds last year, while India-focused funds raised US$6.2 billion across 26 funds.
Tech in Asia’s data shows that VC funds focused on these two regions have seen a sharp rise in fund commitments in 2022 and 2023. Just one month into 2024 and VCs have already raised more than US$1 billion.

Notably, a few of the VCs which announced the final close of their funds this year were those launched in 2022 and 2023. For instance, the Northstar Ventures Fund I, which raised US$140 million, saw its first close in January 2023 and the Asia Partners II fund – which closed with US$474 million – was reported to have raised US$373 million by April 2023.
While a lot of these VCs favor fintech, a significant number of investors are notably sector-agnostic.

This is followed by fintech and enterprise tech as well as healthtech and consumer tech. That said, a number of VC funds zero in on specific segments such as climate tech, agriculture and foodtech, and AI.
Investor interest in climate tech has now eclipsed edtech as several funds look to invest in startups in this space.
While only four AI-focused funds were raised when we first started this piece last year, it has now grown to over 12 funds focused on this sector. There are already a few active investors in AI startups in Southeast Asia.
A larger number of VC funds that have raised in the last four years are eyeing startups in Southeast Asia in comparison to India.

That said, a majority of VCs that have closed their funds are headquartered in Singapore, followed by those based in India and Indonesia.

When it comes to startup stages, it is no surprise that most VCs are looking to back those in the early stage. Though funding for late-stage startups is still coming in, only a handful of VC funds are focused on such deals in this economic climate.

We hope that as we constantly update our database, it will be a useful reference for anyone who’s interested in VC funds focused on Southeast Asia and India.

Photo credit: ByteDance

The US Congress has passed a bill mandating TikTok‘s parent company, ByteDance, to sell its US operations in a year or face a complete ban. The Senate, the Congress’ upper house, approved the bill with 79 votes for and 18 against, according to a South China Morning Post report.
On TikTok’s official account, CEO Shou Zi Chew responded to the news with a video, saying that TikTok isn’t “going anywhere. We are confident and we will keep fighting for your rights in the courts.”
The bill was bundled with a foreign aid package amounting to US$95.3 billion, intended for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan – a move that helped the bill garner bipartisan support. It was also passed despite ByteDance and TikTok collectively shelling out US$7 million on lobbying and ad campaigns.
President Joe Biden intends to sign the bill into law, though former president Donald Trump said that would give Facebook an unfair advantage. Elon Musk, who owns social media platform X, said that TikTok’s ban “would be contrary to freedom of speech and expression.”
Nevertheless, John Thune, a senator supporting the bill, voiced his concern over China’s alleged use of TikTok to get data from the US. Senator Maria Cantwell accused China of creating a “back door” access to Americans.
China’s US embassy objected to the bill, claiming that it stifles fair competition and global trade.
This vote is the US government’s first attempt to shut down a social media company. It also comes amid heightened tensions between the US and China in various spheres, including tech.
The House of Representatives, the US Congress’ lower house, had initially passed the bill last month. However, ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming had previously said that the company had no intentions of selling TikTok in the US, where it has over 175 million users.

In today’s newsletter, we look at:


Notable players in Indonesia’s fintech sector
An expansion of cross-border QR codes within ASEAN countries


Hi there,
Fintech funding into Southeast Asia startups continues to be on a downtrend.
A recent report by data intelligence platform Tracxn found that total funding into Southeast Asia startups fell 13% year on year to US$530 million in the first quarter of 2024. This was largely led by a decline in late-stage funding, but decreasing seed-stage investments also contributed to the downtrend.
Indonesia hasn’t been spared by the funding crunch.
According to Tech in Asia’s data, funding into Indonesia’s fintech startups dropped sharply between 2022 and 2023. Deal count almost halved, while total deal value fell by 53% to US$850 million in 2023.
But, in line with the rest of the region, lending and insurtech sectors held up in 2023, my colleague Budi notes in this week’s Big Story. The landscape map is an update of a previous iteration we first published in 2021, and reflects more recent funding trends in the past three years.
Meanwhile, in our Hot Take this week, I discuss ASEAN’s plan to expand cross-border payment links within the economic bloc and how – despite the convenience that could come with it – it may not be able to eliminate cash entirely just yet.

THE BIG STORY
Mapping the Indonesian fintech players navigating a tech winter

Between 2021 and 2023, the payments, lending, brokerage, and insurtech segments attracted the most money for the country’s fintech industry.

THE HOT TAKE
QR code payments go even more mainstream in Southeast Asia, but eliminating cash is a tough sell

Photo credit: Shutterstock

Here’s what happened:

Earlier this month, ASEAN’s finance ministers agreed to expand cross-border QR payments within the economic bloc, Nikkei Asia reported.
Laos will launch a cross-border QR payment system with Thailand as well as Cambodia, and is currently negotiating a similar arrangement with Vietnam.
Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines already operate several bilateral QR payment networks among them.

Here’s our take:
On a trip to China last year, I took a leap of faith by traveling fully cashless. I’m an avid user of multicurrency cards when I travel, but even with them, I tend to carry some cash on hand – just in case.
Carrying spare cash on hand has proved to be the right call on other overseas trips I’ve made, especially when the multicurrency cards I own failed for reasons that tech support wasn’t able to solve on the spot. And, despite a general push toward digital in most economies, there’s bound to be the outlier merchant that only accepts cash.
An increase in the number of digital payment options certainly addresses this.
With cross-border payments solutions like Ant Group’s Alipay+, partner e-wallets previously limited to domestic transactions are now accepted in some overseas markets. E-wallets like Grab can also be used in multiple Southeast Asian countries.
See also: Alipay+ kicks off major expansion around Asian Games, betting on inbound tourists
As cross-border QR linkages among ASEAN member states expand, traveling in those countries is set to get even more hassle-free.
Within Southeast Asia, Singapore already has bilateral linkages with Malaysia (DuitNow), Thailand (PromptPay), Indonesia (via the QR Code Indonesian Standard, or QRIS), and it’s exploring another with the Philippines. Indonesia has linked its QR payment standard with Thailand’s and Malaysia’s too. (This list is not exhaustive.)
These linkages allow users to scan and pay digitally overseas, directly from their bank accounts, without having to first top up funds into an e-wallet. But because such arrangements have to be negotiated bilaterally, they’re a relatively slow way to scale up.
As Ravi Menon, the former managing director at the Monetary Authority of Singapore, pointed out before: “Three countries require three bilateral links, but 20 countries would require 190 bilateral links.”
The creation of more choices has several implications for customers, businesses, as well as payment operators. Banks are a natural winner, and see a natural adoption of their payment services through their banking apps.
E-wallet players – which still play an important role in enabling payments for those without bank accounts – must differentiate their offerings either by building more payment use cases or offering lower fees. Otherwise, they will end up losing customers to more convenient options.
Some multicurrency apps, for instance, are attempting to drive stickiness by offering value-added services like stock trading and investing tools.
A big beneficiary are the small and medium-sized businesses. Those who are yet to accept any form of digital payments could see an increase in transactions from digital-native tourists.
Speaking on Singapore-Malaysia cross-border spending patterns, UOB said that consumers spent an average of 34 ringgit (US$7.10) at the top 20 UOB Malaysia DuitNow QR merchants between December 2022 and February 2023. Close to 65% of these transactions took place at eateries, minimarts, and dry markets.
Such transactions are expected to rise. UOB, for instance, projected cross-border payments using DuitNow QR to grow 4x between 2023 and 2028.
But such solutions, like many things, aren’t fool-proof and come with their own set of reliability issues. In Singapore, banking disruptions have put digital payment services like PayNow offline for hours on more than one occasion.
That’s why despite the availability of options, it could be a while – years still – before fully cashless travel becomes a reality for most – myself included. Until then, I’ll be toggling between my credit cards, multicurrency apps, digital bank apps, and cash.

Photo credit: Thunes

Singapore-headquartered Thunes, a cross-border payments specialist, is set to acquire Tilia, a US-based payments provider for online games, virtual worlds, and creator economies. The amount is undisclosed.
The deal would allow Thunes – which helps customers like Grab, Paypal, and Uber to send and accept payments across different countries – to expand its offerings to US merchants. They include Tilia’s customers, which use its platform to help convert gamers’ real money into in-game tokens, among other uses.
Tilia’s previous majority owner is Linden Lab, the developer behind the Second Life metaverse. Once the acquisition closes, Thunes will enter into a five-year exclusive partnership with Linden Lab to process the latter’s payments and payouts.
Once approved by regulators, Tilia will take on the Thunes brand but keep its San Francisco headquarters.
Based in Singapore, Thunes has regional offices in the city-state, London, Shanghai, Beijing, Dubai, Hong Kong, and Miami. Last July, the company hit US$900 million in valuation after raising an additional US$12 million from investors like Visa for its series C round.
Thunes said it has 4 billion bank accounts, 3 billion digital wallets, and 550 alternative payment methods connected to its network. It secured a French payments institution license last year.

This is an updated version of the article that was first published on March 19, 2021. Since then, we’ve added several new startups and new funding rounds to the list.
In the last few years, numerous startups have emerged in the Indonesian fintech landscape despite the decline in investor funding since the industry’s peak in 2021.
These include companies like social commerce enabler Orderfaz and credit scoring firm Skorlife, which launched in 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Annual investments into Indonesia-based fintech firms surpassed US$1 billion in 2021 and 2022, but this fell sharply last year amid a global macroeconomic slowdown.
Between 2021 and 2023, the payments, lending, brokerage, and insurtech segments attracted the most money within fintech. However, as funding into the sector fell across the board, only the lending and insurtech sectors held up, mirroring the broader trends in Southeast Asia.

2023 was dominated by two large deals. One of these was the US$206 million deal between P2P platform Amartha and the International Finance Corporation. The other was the US$220 million acquisition of Home Credit Indonesia by Thailand-based Bank of Ayudhya and financing firm Adira Finance, which are both under the MUFG Group.

Finture, which operates the buy now, pay later platform Yup, also beat the funding slump, securing US$20 million in July 2023 from investors including Chinese investment firm XVC. Meanwhile, Kredivo Holdings, which operates BNPL firm Kredivo and Krom Bank Indonesia, raised US$270 million in a series D round led by Japan’s Mizuho Bank in March 2o23.
That said, the country’s BNPL firms have had their own share of troubles. In October 2023, Indonesia’s Financial Services Authority (OJK) limited Akulaku’s operations after the BNPL firm allegedly violated the supervisory obligations required by the government agency.

Akulaku was not the only firm that came under scrutiny. UangTeman, the troubled online lender, was investigated last year for alleged income tax evasion. The firm stopped offering loans beginning in late 2020.
Consistently high default rates in the country’s peer-to-peer lending space have prompted stricter regulations, including a maximum limit on how much interest rates firms can charge.
Several fintech firms have also had ambitions to IPO, but these players have faced roadblocks. P2P lender Akseleran, which intended to list on the Indonesian Stock Exchange in August 2023, postponed its plans after it failed to find the right strategic investor.
Meanwhile, DigiAsia Bios, which was planning a public listing in the US via a SPAC merger deal – originally set for the second quarter of 2023 – has yet to list.
Focus on fintech giants
Fintech continues to be a priority for tech giants, who see the segment as a way to improve their margins.
For instance, GoTo – which turned quarterly EBITDA profitable in Q4 2023 – is planning to integrate its fintech and ecommerce units, following Tokopedia’s merger with TikTok Shop. A BNPL product with TikTok is also in the works.
The ride-hailing giant also launched a standalone GoPay app in July 2023 as it expands its reach to users who don’t yet use the group’s services. This will allow the firm to penetrate further into Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities and compete more directly with other e-wallets like Ovo, Dana, and LinkAja.

This is an updated version of the article that was first published on March 19, 2021. Since then, we’ve added several new startups and new funding rounds to the list.
In the last few years, numerous startups have emerged in the Indonesian fintech landscape despite the decline in investor funding since the industry’s peak in 2021.
These include companies like social commerce enabler Orderfaz and credit scoring firm Skorlife, which launched in 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Annual investments into Indonesia-based fintech firms surpassed US$1 billion in 2021 and 2022, but this fell sharply last year amid a global macroeconomic slowdown.
Between 2021 and 2023, the payments, lending, brokerage, and insurtech segments attracted the most money within fintech. However, as funding into the sector fell across the board, only the lending and insurtech sectors held up, mirroring the broader trends in Southeast Asia.

2023 was dominated by two large deals. One of these was the US$206 million deal between P2P platform Amartha and the International Finance Corporation. The other was the US$220 million acquisition of Home Credit Indonesia by Thailand-based Bank of Ayudhya and financing firm Adira Finance, which are both under the MUFG Group.

Finture, which operates the buy now, pay later platform Yup, also beat the funding slump, securing US$20 million in July 2023 from investors including Chinese investment firm XVC.

FPT, a Vietnamese tech giant, is looking to build a US$200 million “AI factory” in partnership with Nvidia.
This is part of FPT’s goal to make Vietnam an AI powerhouse and accelerate adoption of AI across the region, including in Vietnam, Japan, and South Korea.
With the factory, the partners aim to create a one-stop shop for AI and cloud services “consisting of AI products, GPU infrastructure, tech experts, and domain expertise for clients,” the company said in a statement.
It would also reinforce FPT’s own AI research and development efforts, which center on generative AI, autonomous driving, and sustainability.
As part of this collaboration, FPT joined the Nvidia partner network. Meanwhile, Nvidia will provide its programs to FPT to strengthen the latter’s AI workforce.
FPT is listed on the Ho Chi Minh City stock exchange and is valued at US$5.5 billion. The company recently said that it grew its revenue and profit year on year by 20.6% and 19.5%, respectively, in the first month of 2024.
The company offers services in a wide range of industries, including telco, education, IT services, and retail.

Hello reader,
Some of the best advice about writing I’ve seen is to kill your darlings.
Rather than anything morbid, this simply means that when a particular part of a piece of writing doesn’t work with the overall piece, you have to remove it. No matter how hard you may have worked on it or how beautiful you think the passage is, it must die for your work’s greater good.
Successful writers are great at unsentimentally carrying out this process, and so are successful tech companies.
Instead of consigning flowery metaphors and unnecessary exposition to the grave, tech firms need to look at the new products, services, or features they’ve rolled out, and get rid of those that don’t serve the company overall.
Grab is about to kill one of its darlings, with the Mastercard-issued GrabPay Card set to be discontinued from June 1. As today’s featured piece explores, the death of this card may be necessary for another of Grab’s products to thrive.
Today we look at:


What the death of the GrabPay Card tells us about Grab’s plans for GXS Bank 
Aeon Bank’s plans for Islamic banking services in Malaysia
Other newsy highlights such as the latest Chinese EV firm setting up shop in Thailand and Apple removing some Meta apps from its App Store in China.


Premium summary
Change on the cards for Grab

Image credit: Timmy Loen

On the surface, Grab’s decision to discontinue the GrabPay Card could be seen as part of the ride-hailing giant’s efforts to focus on profitability.
However, if you dig a little deeper, the move may indicate Grab plans to push users toward the payment methods offered by GXS Bank, the digital bank backed by Grab and Singtel.


Taking a bite out of GXS: Grab and Mastercard introduced the GrabPay Card in 2019, offering users loyalty points that could be redeemed on the platform’s app. However, with GXS Bank in the picture after Grab and Singtel launched it in 2022, the card could be seen as potentially cannibalizing the digital bank’s payment business.

No overlaps: GrabPay also recently closed its investment services AutoInvest and Earn+ in Singapore. While GXS doesn’t yet offer similar services, it likely will add them eventually, given its plans to double its loan disbursals. Scrapping these services is another indicator that Grab is being careful to avoid stepping on GXS’s toes.

Profit push: The key challenge in GXS Bank’s effort to reach profitability is encouraging customers to use their accounts in a market where the population is highly banked and has plenty of payment options. To this end, it has already boosted interest rates on customers’ main accounts to 2.38% from 0.08% in August 2023.

News spotlight
Bank on it

Malaysia looks set to get its first Islamic digital banking services.
Aeon Bank, a digital banking license holder in Malaysia, is planning to roll out the services in the second quarter of this year, reported Fintech News Malaysia, quoting The Star.


Game plan: The bank’s CEO Raja Teh Maimunah said it plans to launch an app soon, which will target Gen Z customers and underserved small businesses.

Keep it simple: Aeon Bank aims to begin with a simple product lineup, focusing on things like savings accounts. Down the road, the firm plans to introduce more complex products and financing solutions.

Competition: The bank was formed by a consortium led by Japanese conglomerate Aeon. The group is one of the five that were granted approval to launch digital banks in Malaysia in 2022. Aside from the Aeon-led consortium, only one other group – comprising KAF Investment Bank, Carsome, Jirnexu, and MoneyMatch – plans to operate an Islamic bank.

Recent job cuts from US ecommerce titan Amazon have affected executive staff in Asia Pacific, Campaign reported.
They include Sunil Yadav, who was Amazon Ads’ head of commercial for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa as well as Southeast Asia; and Elliot Renton, sales leader for the Asia-Pacific media, entertainment, and sports industry team at Amazon Web Services (AWS). Both execs are based in Singapore.
Yadav confirmed his exit from Amazon but declined to share more details with Campaign. Meanwhile, an Amazon spokesperson told the publication that despite the layoffs, the company will continue hiring for “targeted areas based on customer needs.”
The development follows job cuts in Prime Video, Amazon’s streaming platform, in Southeast Asia – with the company winding down its original productions in the region to focus more on licensing.
According to a 2022 study by market analyst Canalys, AWS leads Asia Pacific’s cloud market with an estimated 32% market share. It’s followed by Microsoft Azure at 26% and Google Cloud at 9%.
While Amazon Ads has been quieter in the region, Amazon did announce in 2019 that it would be expanding its advertising presence in Asia.

Delivered every Tuesday via email and through the Tech in Asia website, this free newsletter breaks down the biggest stories and trends in emerging tech. If you’re not a subscriber, get access by registering here.
Hello there,
I’ve never ridden in an electric vehicle.
I’m not sure why, but it probably has something to do with growing up in the US in the era of SUVs and V8s. I’ll admit I’ve always been a bit suspicious of anything that didn’t produce a putrid cloud of exhaust.
I’m not saying this is how it should be. Climate change is making it clear that EVs are necessary to help cut down on everyone’s carbon footprint.
But that was for personal vehicles. I didn’t think it was possible to produce enough energy to power a large cargo carrying truck. I was happy to find out I was wrong about that too.
That’s what makes our first Big Story this week so important. Written by my colleague Elyssa, it focuses on how logistics firms across Southeast Asia are purchasing EVs. The motivations are simple: Their clients are demanding it. It doesn’t hurt that it also lowers operating costs.
Not everyone has jumped on the bandwagon yet, but Elyssa has found a couple of companies who bought into EVs early.
Speaking about early strategies, my colleague Collin in our second Big Story analyzes whether the turnaround strategies used by new investors looking to acquire startups could gain traction in Southeast Asia. These firms are looking to take advantage of the declining valuations and shrinking runway of startups, but several challenges persist.
Finally, we’ll take a look at Llama 3, the large language model released by Meta on Friday. In an effort to save my weekend, I immediately tried to get Meta AI to write this intro. No luck.
P.S. The team behind this newsletter will be taking a short break next week. But fear not, we’ll be back in your inbox on May 7, 2024.

THE BIG STORIES
1️⃣ Are SEA’s deliveries about to get greener? These logistics startups think so

Logistics firms in Southeast Asia are turning to electric vehicles for cost savings. But a lack of charging infrastructure remains the biggest roadblock.
2️⃣ New investors eye SEA startups seeking a lifeline, but there’s a catch

As valuations fall and runways shrink, a new wave of investors in the region is eager to acquire and assume control of startups.

AI ODYSSEY
Promising AI projects we’re noticing
Llama 3 will kick-start AIs move to social media apps
Meta launched Llama 3 AI, its open-source, large language model, on Friday.
You’d be forgiven if you missed it. There has been a rush of AI releases this month, and that trend doesn’t seem to be going away.
But Llama 3 isn’t just another update. First, it will be used to power Meta’s new chatbot, MetaAI, which will be included in four of the firm’s flagship apps: Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp.

Photo credit: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock

Meta AI will initially be released in 13 countries and only in English. Singapore is the only Southeast Asian country in this list.
While there are plenty of ways to access generative AI, this move puts the tech in the hands of 3 billion daily users. This means your parents and grandparents, for better or for worse, will now have the ability to ask questions and generate images at their fingertips.
Given the more general (non-tech focused) audience on these apps, Meta says it wants to focus on providing a better user experience with additional features.
My favorite is the type-as-you-go image generator.
This feature lets Meta AI continually redraw the image as you type, which can be a bit shocking if you’re not expecting it. However, it does make the creation process an interesting experience. The first time I tried creating an image, it made me wonder why my screen was freaking out.
Other new features include CyberSecEval, a cybersecurity feature that aims to prevent the generation of code that could be used in hacking attacks.
But more important to a general audience is the child safety risk assessment. The image generation software was tested to ensure that users can’t generate child porn.
Meta might have an unparalleled audience, but it doesn’t have the processing capabilities that OpenAI has yet.
Meta launched with two versions on Friday: Llama 3 8B, which comes with 8 billion parameters, and Llama 70B, which has 70 billion parameters. Meta claims that, for their respective parameter counts, they are among the best-performing generative AI models available today.
That may be true, but that “respective count” is nowhere near what OpenAI is working with. GPT-4, in comparison, is estimated to have 1.8 trillion parameters.
Parameters are the variables that AI models learn during training and are used by the model to determine what word comes next. The higher the number of parameters, the better the AI is at learning from its own data.
But Llama 3 may just be a speed bump on Meta’s road to catch up with OpenAI. Yann LeCun, Meta’s chief AI scientist, announced that a 400 billion parameter version is also in the works, although he did not give any estimated release date.
Expect the AI race to continue.

Accacia, an India-based real estate decarbonization startup, has secured US$6.5 million in a pre-series A funding round. Global VC firm Illuminate Financial led the funding, with participation from AC Ventures, Accel, and B Capital.
Founded in 2022 by Annu Talreja, Piyush Chitkara, and Jagmohan Gaarg, Accacia aims to lessen the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the real estate and construction sectors, which make up 40% of the global total.
It offers an AI-enabled SaaS tool that aids real estate managers, owners, and developers in managing emissions and planning their decarbonization strategies.
According to data from Boston Consulting Group, using AI can not only lessen 5% to 10% of overall emissions but also contribute US$1.3 trillion to US$2.6 trillion in value from additional revenue and reduced costs by 2030.
“We have already deployed our solution to over 25 million square feet of real estate and are poised to leverage this opportunity and scale globally,” said Talreja, who is also the CEO of the company, in a statement.
Accacia’s platform integrates with existing property management, energy management, and procurement systems. This integration enables real-time data collection and tracking, providing a fast and cost-effective solution for businesses striving for net-zero emissions.
According to AC Ventures, approximately US$18 trillion is predicted to be needed in the coming 10 years for the real estate industry’s net-zero ambition. This sector, however, is becoming a key area for climate solutions, with large VC funds focusing on decarbonizing properties.
Previously, Accacia raised US$2.5 million in a seed funding round led by Accel and B Capital.

After reaching an agreement in November 2022, Gojek Singapore and ComfortDelGro Taxi have officially launched their partnership in the city-state.
Under the partnership, which will roll out in two stages starting on April 29, rides unclaimed by drivers on one platform will become available to drivers from the other.
It would initially allow ComfortDelGro Taxi drivers to pick up unclaimed Gojek rides. Soon, Gojek drivers will be allowed to do the same for ComfortDelGro Taxi bookings. This way, both companies hope to reduce customer wait times and increase service reliability.
Jobs will always be offered first to driver-partners on their original platforms, the firms said.
“With this partnership, drivers will be able to see higher demand and improved earnings,” said Lien Choong Luen, Gojek Singapore’s general manager, in a joint statement.
Despite the improved service, ride prices will stay the same, both companies said.
Additionally, Gojek and ComfortDelGro Taxi said they are exploring partnerships in areas like electric vehicles, new revenue streams, and supporting services like insurance, driver training, and vehicle maintenance.
This partnership will face competition from the collaboration between Grab and Trans-cab, which was acquired by the regional super-app giant in July 2023. As of January 2024, ComfortDelGro still has the largest taxi fleet in Singapore with 6,512 taxis, while Trans-cab has 2,097 taxis.

The size of the deal, which is set to close by the the third quarter of 2024, was not disclosed.

AiChat helps brands automate business processes in customer service, marketing, and e-commerce via social messaging apps.
Meanwhile Toku, which currently creates bespoke cloud communications and customer engagement solutions for enterprises, hopes to enhance its existing service with AiChat and become a full-service CX tech firm.
The right fit
Founded in 2018 by Thomas Laboulle, Toku currently boasts an annual revenue of US$31 million as of 2023. The expanded capabilities and synergies achieved through the acquisition is expected to unlock an estimated 50% revenue boost for AiChat within a year after the purchase, CEO Laboulle tells Tech in Asia.
It will also enable Toku to provide a broader range of solutions, which would create “significant opportunities for upselling and cross-selling across our expanded customer base,” says Laboulle, though he did not give more details. The company counts Foodpanda, Zenyum and Prudential as some of its customers.
By acquiring AiChat, Toku can also enhance its existing voice, messaging, and cloud communications suite with a new layer of conversational AI, the CEO notes.
“The anticipated 50% revenue growth within the first year after acquiring AiChat will largely be unlocked by leveraging Toku’s established sales and marketing capabilities,” he adds.
With this, the company is aiming to reach EBITDA breakeven by the fourth quarter of this year and become cash flow positive by 2025.
What lies ahead
Initially, Toku will continue to develop AiChat’s existing road map as a standalone product. It also plans to leverage AiChat’s expertise in channels such as WhatsApp, Google Messages, and Line.
One particular focus for Toku is the opportunity in regional language processing.
“We have developed a comprehensive in-house transcription model trained on proprietary data and integrated with regional and local NLP (natural language processing) libraries,” Laboulle says. This model can handle languages and dialects like Malay and Singlish, which he says are often overlooked by Western offerings.
This collaboration is also expected to lead to the development of a “sophisticated voice bot that could revolutionize how businesses scale human-like customer engagement,” he added.
As part of the integration, AiChat’s team will join Toku’s, increasing the combined entity’s total staff count to 160. Both firms plan to maintain all of their employees and leverage their combined strengths for growth.
This is Toku’s second acquisition in two years. In April 2023, it acquired customer engagement firm Activeo Singapore.
Toku said it is open to M&amp;A opportunities, “as long as it aligns with our vision.”

Malaysia’s sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional, along with Blue Chip Venture Capital and local retirement fund KWAP, are setting up a venture capital fund. Worth up to 3 billion ringgit (US$627 million), the fund would target Southeast Asian startups, Bloomberg reported.
This move is part of Malaysia’s larger goal to become one of the top 20 global startup centers. The country aims to double VC investments to US$1.4 billion by 2030 and plans to invite 12 international VC firms to set up shop in Malaysia.
Malaysia is also offering subsidies for office rentals and visa waivers to global tech companies expanding to the country. Global semiconductor giant Arm Holdings and chemical firm OCI Holdings have already announced plans to invest in Malaysia.
Data from the Securities Commission Malaysia shows large growth in VC and private equity funds in Malaysia, rising from US$690.4 million in 2006 to US$3.68 billion in 2023.
According to KWAP CEO Nik Amlizan Mohamed, the pension fund plans to invest more in startups and VCs to increase its returns. This is part of Malaysia’s strategic move to attract more international capital to Southeast Asia while boosting the local startup sector and listings in Kuala Lumpur.
State-owned Malaysia Venture Capital Management – the country’s largest VC firm – recently said it would double its investments to US$1.4 billion as part of the company’s Malaysia Venture Capital Roadmap, backed by the country’s Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation.
Under this strategy, the company will up its efforts in funding, regulatory reform, and expanding capacity.

Atome Financial, a digital financial services provider in Southeast Asia, saw major growth in 2023, with operating income rising from US$88 million to US$170 million.
Atome, the company’s buy now, pay later arm, handled nearly US$1.5 billion in gross merchandise volume (GMV) – a 40% jump from 2022. The increase in transactions led to a 130% revenue bump, pushing Atome into profit.
The company attributed the growth to improved efficiency, simplified processes, and expanded trade partnerships. Its ecommerce platforms TikTok Shop and Lazada as well as insurance major Chubb also boosted revenue and user numbers.
As it ventured into digital cash services, Atome Financial introduced new products. It launched the Atome PayLater Anywhere Card and Atome Cash loans in markets including Indonesia and the Philippines.
All in all, the company said that as a group, it turned EBITDA positive in the first quarter of 2024.
There were some headwinds on its way to this milestone, however. In October 2022, Atome Financial laid off some of its staff in Indonesia to slash costs. The company exited Vietnam in July 2023, saying the country’s “contribution to [its] overall business was limited.”
Its growth also comes after a slow 2022, when it posted a 9% dip in revenue to US$166.7 million, according to data from Alternatives.pe, which tracks filings in Singapore.
“The real ingredient of our success is our risk management capabilities,” Atome Financial CFO Trina Yeung told Tech in Asia.
Advance.AI, Atome’s sister company specializing in KYC digital identity and fraud prevention, enabled Atome to acquire expertise in KYC and credit scoring prior to entering the lending sector, according to Yeung.
Another key factor contributing to its success is scale, says Yeung. “If you have a good promotion network, then it attracts the users.”
Its current user base totals 10 million, encompassing both P2P lending and BNPL services.
While the company has its largest base in Indonesia, it is super excited about Malaysia and the Philippines as there is “much less competition in those markets,” said Yeung.

That old idiom seems to apply to the current state of Southeast Asia’s tech ecosystem. As layoffs, plummeting valuations, and drying venture funding continue to plague the sector, a new class of investors is emerging in the region.
Their aim is to get a majority stake in targeted startups, mold them into profitable businesses, and then seek quick exits via acquisitions or public listings.

One such investor is Singapore-based Turn Capital. The turnaround fund was established in 2020 by Joseph Phua, a co-founder of livestreaming firm 17Live.
In November 2023, Turn Capital raised over S$20 million (US$14.7 million) after the first close of its maiden fund to take controlling stakes in consumer and technology firms – especially those that are no longer VC-investable – and then steer them to profitability.
Flash Coffee’s Thailand unit was Turn Capital’s first acquisition. The coffee startup fit the bill since it was undergoing consolidation across markets, and the investor saw potential for a turnaround.
But is turnaround investing truly as straightforward as it seems? And will it take off in this part of the world?
Investors or rescuers?
This approach bears some resemblance to what private equity (PE) firms typically pursue, but they often target more mature or profitable businesses.
But Shang Koo, Turn Capital’s general partner and CFO, points out that what investors like his firm do is “somewhat closer to management buyouts.”

According to Koo, the turnaround strategy prioritizes budget discipline, which is crucial as some founders receive excessive VC funding and “spend it on whatever trend is hot.”

This entails holding off on releasing new products or expanding to new markets and pulling back from “anything else that isn’t essential to the core business.” Ultimately, the business needs to reach breakeven and the unit economics need to improve, he says.
While VC funds aim for a 3x return over a 10-year cycle, Turn Capital targets 3x to 5x return within five years. “In that 10 years, we could make 10x, because we split it up, take less time, and get a quicker and easier exit,” general partner Kheng Lian Ho tells Tech in Asia.
However, reversing the fortunes of a distressed company is no easy task. Turnaround investors must depend on and provide incentives for existing management teams and founders to keep the company afloat and running.
At this stage, founders are often stressed and emotional, Ho says.
“It is a very charged atmosphere because we are dealing with companies that have one to two months runway left. Managing their egos [is not easy], as sometimes it can be difficult for them to hear what they are not doing right,” she explains.
She adds that for such investments, the downside protection is that her firm often purchases companies at a low price. Ho is confident that with the right strategy, these businesses will “breakeven no matter what.”
In the case of Flash Coffee’s Thailand subsidiary, the first part in their turnaround strategy is to reach positive unit economics and cut fixed costs, shares Koo.
This includes refining menu items and ingredients in order to reduce inventory and logistics costs, closing down underperforming stores, and ensuring that store floor sizes match the foot traffic.

Turn Capital will set fixed costs for the Thailand unit’s headquarters, which includes recruiting a local team that knows the market.
“Once we have resolved all of these issues, we will go on to our second step, which is the expansionary phase where we will invest to build out the scale,” says Koo.
As Tech in Asia previously reported, Turn Capital wants to open more than 100 new Flash Coffee stores in Thailand within the next two years. The turnaround firm has been monitoring Flash Coffee since April 2023 but only restarted discussions with management when the coffee startup had to liquidate its Singapore operations, according to The Business Times.
Leadership mindset
Chad Ovel, a partner at Vietnamese PE firm Mekong Capital, understands the post-acquisition hurdles faced by investors.
The biggest challenge is recruiting and retaining management that has both “distinct leadership competency and an ownership mindset,” he says. While tech founders often are willing to try, fail, and succeed, “a lot of the C-suite available to turn around a business come from more traditional stable business models.”

Unlike Turn Capital, however, Mekong Capital doesn’t acquire distressed companies. Instead, the PE firm targets businesses that have proven unit economics and need the capital for expansion.
Tech companies in its portfolio include insect-protein startup Entobel, biotech company Gene Solutions, and proptech platform Rever. Mekong Capital’s biggest exit to date is Mobile World, which generated a 57x return for the PE firm’s second fund in 2018.

However, it’s not only turnaround and PE investors that seek to influence the trajectory of their portfolio companies.
Search funds – also called “entrepreneurship through acquisition” – have started popping up in Southeast Asia. This model allows aspiring entrepreneurs or “searchers” to locate, acquire, and grow small businesses, usually using investor money.
Earlier this month, search fund Garlic Equity Capital was launched in Singapore, claiming to be the first of its kind in the city-state. In 2022, a search fund called LT Partners was established in Vietnam and said it already had US$30 million in committed capital.
No grand exits
The reality is that Southeast Asia does not have a stellar record of providing attractive exit opportunities for investors.
Exit activities dropped by 22% for VCs and 33% for PE firms in 2023 and remain much smaller compared to those in markets such as North America, Europe, China, and India, according to a recent PitchBook report.
“In Southeast Asia, there just doesn’t seem to be a large enough opportunity set for PE firms come in and take controlling stakes in companies,” Kyle Stanford, lead VC analyst at research firm PitchBook, tells Tech in Asia.
Acquirers typically look for companies that have successfully cornered a significant share of the market within a region. With the exception of Sea Group and Grab, no other tech firm based in Southeast Asia has achieved widespread dominance across the region.
For Turn Capital, the exit strategies include listing on smaller exchanges or selling to larger players in the market, PE firms, or family offices looking to reap dividends from a profitable business.

Ho of Turn Capital noted that the firm completed the first blank-check or SPAC deal in Singapore last December and is currently working on the exit of a firm on the Taiwan exchange.
Turn Capital also divested a minority stake in Taiwan-based podcast firm SoundOn to recover its initial capital and receives regular dividends.
Koo, Turn Capital’s CFO, was also the key person in the US$1 billion listing of Chinese luxury fashion brand on the New York Stock Exchange in 2022 and the 2011 IPO of Chinese dating website Jiayuan on Nasdaq.
Before acquiring Flash Coffee’s Thailand business last year, Turn Capital had already identified potential strategic acquirers for this venture and devised a plan to complete the deal, according to Koo.
A pivotal aspect of the investor’s strategy is targeting firms ranked lower in market share. This approach guarantees potential interest from market leaders seeking acquisitions to bolster their market presence.
Slow adoption to non-VCs?
In the US, new investors are raising funds to acquire and turn startups around, disrupting the lackluster VC market. This includes turnaround firm Arising Ventures, which made a notable statement via a billboard in San Francisco last year: “We invest in second chances.”
However, non-VC investors might struggle in Southeast Asia because there are less attractive targets – i.e., promising startups that have a viable path to profitability.
Mekong Capital’s Ovel emphasizes that as long as startups in the region get support from existing investors to extend their runway through bridge rounds, emergence of more turnaround funds in Southeast Asia remains unlikely.

Though the low valuations have created more opportunities for these new investment vehicles, Stanford of PitchBook doesn’t see non-VC acquisitions becoming a huge trend in the region.
An industry insider tells Tech in Asia that there are limited opportunities for search funds in the region as owners of SME businesses are still far from retirement age. Search funds generally seek sustainable businesses whose owners are on the verge of retiring, don’t have a succession plan, and want to sell the business.

Despite all its efforts to buy and operate companies, will search funds ultimately yield substantial returns for investors in Southeast Asia?
Historically, search funds give an internal rate of return (IRR) – what an investor stands to gain on their initial investment each year – of 30%, says Aik Chuan Goh, managing partner of Garlic Equity Capital. In comparison, PE and VC funds in Southeast Asia had less than 15% IRR from during 2010 to 2020, according to data from Prequin, which tracks fund performances.
“Valuation is a real issue – I met people that said their companies are like Rolex,” says the industry insider. “When you buy a Rolex, you don’t look at the price. You just buy it because it’s worth it.”

Stoxkart, an online trading platform based in India, has raised 1 billion rupees (US$11.9 million) from financial services firm SMC Global.
Founded in 2019, Stoxkart aims to simplify trading by offering a zero-brokerage model for delivery trading. This lets investors boost returns without worrying about high commissions, the company said. Its flat fee structure for future and options and intraday trading also makes trading more accessible.
The platform provides various chart analysis tools and features like order slicing, helping it compete with local players such as Zerodha and Groww.
The fresh funding will fuel tech innovation, product development, marketing, and customer acquisition over the next 24 months at Stoxkart, which aims to hit 1 million downloads annually.
Among online trading platforms, Groww has the most number of monthly active users (MAUs), reaching 6.8 million as of October 2023, according to data from Dalal Street Investment Journal, It took the crown from Zerodha in August 2023, which ranks second with 6.5 million MAUs.
However, Tech in Asia previously reported that Zerodha’s active user growth has been slowing since March 2022. In an interview, Zerodha founder Nithin Kamath referred to a blog post saying that “new account openings had dropped off a cliff along with the market drop.”

On December 31 last year, Singapore-based fintech startup Bambu had shut down. This is hardly unusual: Startups shut down all the time, especially in an economic downturn – except the company was moving closer to profitability earlier in the year.
“We had large clients and we were getting there,” Ned Phillips, founder and CEO of the B2B fintech firm, told Tech in Asia in an interview.
A source close to the company told Tech in Asia that an investor “pulled the rug because the market was down and the burn wasn’t reducing enough.”
Phillips, however, said that the shutdown was a joint decision between the management and investors. They had decided that if Bambu did not go into the black by the end of the year, it would close shop, he added.
Bambu, which enables financial institutions to offer robo-advisory products, ultimately fell short.
“We couldn’t get there in the timeline,” Phillips said.
‘Could have been a huge success’
Founded in 2016 by Phillips, Luke Janssen, and Aki Ranin, Bambu raised at least US$13.4 million from Franklin Templeton Investments, Wavemaker Partners, Octava, and others.
Although Bambu is more of a software provider, it rode on a surge in interest in robo-advisory services. The sector, however, has since cooled. Local players MoneyOwl and Smartly have been shut down. Even US banking giant JPMorgan wound down its robo-advisor.
The surviving local services – StashAway, Syfe, AutoWealth, and Endowus – are still reportedly unprofitable.
Phillips attributes Bambu’s closure chiefly to the macroeconomic landscape and ballooning interest rates, which made it difficult for the firm to scout for more enterprise deals.
He added that Bambu’s profitability plan hinged on improving its product while generating more scalable and recurring revenue.
One of last year’s biggest initiatives was a product called Bambu Go. Launched in November, it provided financial institutions with a customizable robo-advisor, which they could, in turn, offer to mass retail investors.
Finding customers didn’t seem to be an issue. Phillips said that Bambu’s tech was sold to its clients as part of its liquidation process, and that none of its customers were affected.
The liquidation is “ongoing but we have had multiple buyers of the technology,” he said.
However, the source close to Bambu said that while the firm was strong in sales, it wasn’t as proficient in operations and technology. Although the startup later shored up these areas by bringing on competent executives, time had simply run out.
“Bambu could have been a huge success in wealthtech – a global leader,” the person said.
For now, Phillips said he is consulting for a few companies, sharing his experience in branding and sales initiatives.
“[Bambu] did a lot. We had some great clients. We’ve got some great tech that lives on. We are super proud of what we did,” the founder said.

Aeon Bank, which holds a Malaysian digital banking license, looks to roll out the country’s first Islamic digital banking services by the end of the second quarter, Fintech News Malaysia reported, quoting The Star.
The bank’s app will target Gen Z and underserved small businesses, according to CEO Raja Teh Maimunah.
The bank was formed by a consortium consisting of Aeon Credit and Aeon Financial Services – all under the Japanese conglomerate Aeon – as well as MoneyLion, though the US-based neobank left the group in May last year.
Aeon Bank plans to begin operations with simple offerings, which include savings accounts, and aims to introduce more complex products and financing solutions as it progresses.
Fitting into the global shift toward cashless transactions, the bank strives to close a 90 billion ringgit (US$18.8 billion) funding gap faced by small businesses that are ignored by big banks.
By 2025, the bank plans to launch services for businesses, especially those using social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram. Such businesses are, according Aeon Bank, often overlooked by typical banks. This holds significance as TikTok Shop alone hosts more than 1 million sellers on its platform in the country alone.
The Aeon-led consortium is among the five groups granted approval to launch digital banks in Malaysia in 2022. Three of these consortia will operate conventional digital banks: Boost and RHB; Grab-Singtel and Kuok Brothers; and YTL Digital Capital and Sea Group.
The remaining two will operate Islamic digital banks. Alongside Aeon’s group, a consortium consisting of KAF Investment Bank, Carsome, Jirnexu, and MoneyMatch also holds this license.

Piyush Gupta, managing director for strategic development at Peak XV Partners, is stepping down from his role to pursue his own fund, Tech Crunch reported, citing sources.
Gupta’s upcoming business will concentrate on secondary transactions, which are rising in India. Peak XV plans to work with Gupta on such transactions involving its portfolio firms, the report noted.
Gupta joined Peak XV, formerly known as Sequoia Capital India and Southeast Asia, in 2017.
While not part of Peak XV’s investment team, Gupta has over 20 years of experience in investment banking, having previously held positions at Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank. He is also a board member at digital payments company Pine Labs.
Gupta’s decision to move on was announced at Peak XV’s annual meeting in March, one source said.
At the event, the firm also shared its plans to create a perpetual fund, which will be financed by its investors and team. Called the Peak XV Anchor Fund, it will manage capital for an unlimited period versus typical funds that have a 10-year cycle, a source previously told Tech in Asia.

Hello reader,
Whenever I think of family offices, I like to have a little fun and imagine them as being run like mafia families in gangster movies.
cue scene
A startup founder walks into a dimly lit room, nervously fiddling with his thumbs. His eyes set upon a sturdy wooden desk and elegant leather chair sat squarely in the center of the room.
“H-hello, sir,” the founder says, trying to keep his voice steady to avoid betraying how hard his heart is thumping in his chest.
The chair swivels around, as if the person sitting in it owns all the time in the world.
“Go on…” the mafia leader says in a gravelly voice. “Tell me what you’ve got, son.”
The founder explains what his startup does and the solutions it offers. The leader nods his head slowly and clasps his hands together.
“Alright,” he says. “I’ll make you an offer you can’t refuse.”
He gestures to a dark corner of the room, where a younger man suddenly separates himself from the shadows. The startup founder stifles a little yelp.
“My son will take over from here.”

While they certainly AREN’T mafias, family offices in Southeast Asia have actually been rather involved in the region’s startup scene. Today’s premium story takes a closer look at what they’ve been pumping their money into.
Today we look at:

The big-name families supporting Southeast Asian startups  
A new multimodal language model from Reka AI

Premium summary
Meet the family

Image credit: Timmy Loen

This comes as a bit of a surprise to me, but according to EY-Parthenon, almost 75% of conglomerates in Southeast Asia are owned by families. That’s a really huge number, and it shows just what these families are capable of, which should be a good sign for the tech sector.


Safe havens: Of the family offices that have invested in Southeast Asian startups that we’ve recorded, 23 are based in Singapore while 10 are in Indonesia. The Philippines has four, with the remaining eight spread across different countries. 

Double prong: The family offices we’ve noted down invest primarily in seven sectors: fintech, ecommerce, climate tech, SaaS, healthtech, consumer tech, and AI. Of these, the two most popular ones are fintech and ecommerce. 

Familiar roads: Some family offices, such as the Philippines’ JG Digital Equity Ventures and Indonesia’s Sinar Mas Digital Ventures, invest in startups from their respective countries that are adjacent to their main business.

The new kid on the block

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Everyone’s launching AI language models left, right, and center, and Reka AI has decided to join the fray. Known as Reka Core, the company said that the model is “competitive” with the likes of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Gemini. Let’s see if it holds up.


Home, truly: While Reka AI is based in San Francisco, it has two Southeast Asian founders. Its chief scientist, Yi Tay, is Singaporean, while CEO Dani Yogatama grew up in Indonesia. 

Covered bases: According to the firm, it is just one of two developers – the other being Google – whose commercially available models allow for “comprehensive multimodal input,” which means it has a “powerful” contextualized understanding of images, videos, and audio. 

Bold claims: Reka AI has also said that Core outperforms Google’s Gemini Ultra on video-related tasks and is comparable to OpenAI’s GPT-4V on MMMU, an AI benchmark.

1️⃣ Sounds like a good prognosis
Diagnos Laboratorium Utama, a laboratory chain, plans to acquire Asa Ren, a DNA testing company. The former, which is based in Jakarta, aims to purchase a nearly 98% stake in the latter, which is incorporated in Singapore but operates in Indonesia. The deal is said to be worth US$24 million.
2️⃣ More housing support is always good
Altum Credo has netted US$40 million in series C money. Based in India, the housing finance firm focuses on digitalizing the lending process, with applicants being able to apply for loans online. It plans to use this latest injection to boost its assets, enhance distribution, and expand operations.
3️⃣ Wish I had this back in my day
Gauth, an “AI homework helper” from ByteDance subsidiary GauthTech, has become the second-most downloaded education app in the US, behind only Duolingo. Launched in 2020, users can get help with their homework by uploading a picture of an assignment and letting the app’s AI work through the solutions.
4️⃣ Never tell me the odds
Edtech startup Beyond Odds Technologies has raised US$11 million in seed funding. Founded by former Unacademy COO Vivek Sinha, the firm runs a training, certification, and recruitment platform that targets gray-collar workers, who can receive hands-on coaching from industry partners.
5️⃣ OPEN UP!
Singapore-based SWAT Mobility has raised an additional US$3.8 million for its latest funding round, bringing the total to US$7.2 million. Founded in 2015, the firm offers AI-powered solutions for mobility companies, helping them generate efficient travel routes.
6️⃣ Sinking roots
Apple will invest more than US$250 million to expand its campus in Singapore, with construction set to begin later this year.

Thailand had previously rolled out incentives to encourage carmakers from China to invest in the Southeast Asian country’s electric vehicle production capabilities.
Now, China-based Chery Automobile is set to construct a manufacturing plant in Thailand, with vehicle production planned to start by 2025, Reuters reported, citing Thailand’s Board of Investment.
The plant aims to initially produce 50,000 hybrid and electric vehicles, but the number is expected to increase to 80,000 by 2028. With this, Chery would be the eighth Chinese car company to invest in manufacturing in Thailand, coming after majors BYD, Great Wall Motor, and Changan Automobile.
Thailand’s auto industry, traditionally dominated by Japanese firms such as Toyota and Honda, has seen Chinese investments of over US$1.44 billion in recent years, the report noted.
Recognizing Thailand’s crucial role as an auto assembly and export hub, Thai authorities aim for one-third of the country’s annual vehicle production – around 2.5 million currently – to be electric by 2030, supported by new subsidy and incentive policies.
EV players from other countries have also been interested in expanding their reach into Thailand. These include Vietnam’s VinFast, which recently announced its partnership with 15 local dealerships.

Vietnamese B2B pharmaceutical platform Buymed has reported a 2x year-on-year growth in revenue for 2022, reaching US$76.4 million, according to its latest available financial filings in Singapore.
The startup, having secured US$63.5 million over four rounds of funding to date, also saw a threefold increase in operating losses compared to the previous year, reaching US$15.3 million.
This rise was attributed to heightened administrative expenses, which was driven by a bump in general provisions to US$12.7 million. General provisions are typically capital set aside by the company to settle past obligations. However, provisions that will be reimbursed are considered assets.
Buymed, known as Thuocsi in Vietnam, primarily serves mom and pop pharmacies by enabling them to access drugs from manufacturers and distributors at better prices. The startup, backed by investors like UOB Venture Management, Smilegate, Cocoon Capital, and B Capital, has expanded its marketplace model to Cambodia and Thailand.
Buymed’s CEO, Hoang Nguyen, declined to participate in this story.

Significant cash flow concerns surfaced for the firm in 2022. Although the cash used in the platform’s operating activities for the year went down, it still surpassed the cash reserves reported on the firm’s balance sheet.
This suggests that without a shift in financial strategy, Buymed risked depleting its cash reserves within the year.
In Vietnam, the company’s business relies on whether its main customers – independent drug stores – can survive amid growing competition with large drugstore chains like Long Chau and An Khang.

In a previous interview with Tech in Asia, CEO Hoang Nguyen acknowledged that simply competing in drug retail wouldn’t suffice for Buymed. This explains why the startup has expanded to B2B2C franchising, which involves helping drug stores boost their sales through tech-enabled inventory management and other fulfillment services.
Buymed is not the sole pharma-focused company in Vietnam aiming to make significant strides this year.
Nguyen Bach Diep, CEO of FPT Retail, recently announced plans to sell up to 10% of shares in the firm’s pharmacy chain, Long Chau. This move, as reported by local media, will enable the company to raise the number of Long Chau stores nationwide to 1,900 and increase its vaccination centers to 100.

Hello reader,
Maximizing shareholder value has become a bit of a grubby phrase, thanks in no small part to internet meme culture. After all, it’s hard to be motivated to make the rich richer when you’re holding down a pretty boring 9 to 5 job (I speak from past experience).
But online loathing aside, this is what stewards of publicly listed companies are tasked with doing. To be sure, it’s not their only mission, but it’s likely a top priority.
In this week’s Big Story, my colleague Simon dives into share buybacks, a practice designed to boost a company’s share price and return capital to shareholders.
Simon analyzed 12 of Asia’s biggest tech firms but found little correlation between a share buyback and share performance. If anything, the companies that didn’t purchase their own shares performed better over time.
As the full piece shows, share buybacks are no silver bullet for poor operational performance.

THE BIG STORY

Asia tech firms go big on buybacks, but outcomes are mixed
Our sample of 12 Asian tech companies suggests that, over the past six months, those that did not announce buybacks outperformed those that did.

3 Trends to keep an eye on
Hot stocks, earnings reports, restructuring, pressure from activist investors, and more.

1️⃣ An Apple investment a day keeps the doctor away: Apple (AAPL, Nasdaq) CEO Tim Cook has been touring Southeast Asia in the past week and wherever he went, promises of investment have followed.
During his visit to Vietnam, Cook said Apple plans to increase its investments in the country’s electronics suppliers. Since 2019, the firm has poured US$15.8 billion through its Vietnam-based supply chain partners.
While in Indonesia, Cook announced that the company would open an Apple Developer Academy in Bali. Apple already has three such academies in Jakarta, Surabaya, and Batam, but it’s easy to imagine why a holiday island like Bali might be a more popular destination for developers.
In Singapore, where Apple employs more than 3,600 people, the firm announced it would be investing a further US$250 million to expand its campus in the city-state.
2️⃣ Bump in the road?: VinFast (VFS, Nasdaq) has some ambitious goals for 2024, including delivering 100,000 electric vehicles (EVs). However, judging by its first quarter results the Vietnam-based firm has some way to go.
VinFast delivered 9,689 EVs – 4x more than a year ago – in Q1, but that’s still well off its 2024 target. The firm also recorded a net loss of US$618.3 million, more than double its revenue during the period.
Despite the results, VinFast appears confident. The firm remains “committed” to meeting its delivery goals and views the ongoing global economic and geopolitical uncertainties as “temporary hurdles,” says chairperson Thuy Le.
3️⃣ Chips are down: Chipmaker TSMC’s (2330, TWSE) stock price dipped by 6% after releasing its first-quarter earnings report.
It seems markets were more concerned about TSMC’s reduced growth outlook for the global semiconductor industry, despite the firm’s forecasts that its Q2 sales may rise by as much as 30% amid increasing demand for the semiconductors used in AI applications.
As smartphone and personal computing markets remain weak, decreased demand for consumer electronics looks set to dampen the chip sector’s gains from the AI revolution.

The one you didn’t see coming
We spotlight the story that had everyone talking and social media buzzing during the past week.

We’re going to need a bigger check: How much is a CEO worth to a company? Most of us probably wouldn’t say US$56 billion, but I suppose most CEOs aren’t like Elon Musk.
Shareholders of Tesla (TSLA, Nasdaq) agreed to a pay package worth that staggering sum in 2018. But it has yet to be paid out to Musk after the deal prompted a lawsuit from a shareholder and was rejected by a Delaware judge this year.
Now, Tesla is asking shareholders to approve the compensation and the relocation of its corporate HQ to Texas.
It seems like an odd time to award Musk a sum worth more than the gross domestic product of well over half of the world’s nations, given the 37% drop in Tesla’s stock price this year and the job cuts that affected 10% of its global workforce.
However, as with all things Musk, logic isn’t necessarily the arbiter of how things will go.

That’s it for this edition – we hope you liked it!

845348,2024-04-22T05:00:39,2024-04-22T04:10:48,Are SEA’s deliveries about to get greener? These logistics startups think so,southeast-asia-startups-drive-ev-adoption-prepandemic-ordinary-2024,publish,post,https://www.techinasia.com/southeast-asia-startups-drive-ev-adoption-prepandemic-ordinary-2024,"Before the pandemic, seeing an electric vehicle (EV) on the roads of some Southeast Asian countries would have been nearly impossible. By 2024, it’s become an ordinary sight.
From Manila to Jakarta, a number of logistics startups are driving the mainstream adoption of electric vehicles.

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Mober, a logistics firm based in the Philippines is one of them. The startup began in 2015 as an on-demand delivery service for large items with fleets ranging from delivery vans to six-wheeler trucks.
It proved too expensive to compete with similar companies in the market. “We didn’t have the war chest to compete,” Dennis Ng, founder and CEO of Mober, tells Tech in Asia.
So by 2017, he transformed the business into a third-party logistics provider for shops located in malls. It clicked.
In 2022, the company reached net profitability for the first time. So for a company that has had many U-turns, why pivot to adopt EVs now?
“I always listen to my clients,” Ng says. “When one of them asked if I offered deliveries through an EV, I said yes, I could. So in 2021, I bought two EV units.” It certainly helped that the client asking was the multinational furniture maker Ikea.

Mober CEO Dennis Ng / Photo credit: Mober

Ever since it became evident that the world had to stay within the 1.5 degree Celsius climate threshold, governments and corporations alike have taken their part in ensuring that the planet does not exceed that limit.
Multinational companies, in particular, have pledged to achieve net-zero emissions in their operations. This means they would either drop or limit activities that emit greenhouse gasses or counterbalance the activities that do so through natural means or through carbon capture technologies.
So for Ng, whose clients include the Philippine offices of Ikea, Nestle, and other multinational firms that have pledged to net-zero operations by 2050, a bet on EVs is not rocket science.
“I’m giving Mober just a two- to three-years window of when it can enjoy itself as the only logistics company that offers deliveries through EVs,” Ng says. “After that, I expect most logistics companies to make the switch.”
In Europe, logistics firms have been much quicker to transition to EVs, with the likes of UPS doing so as early as 2018. In China, all vehicles leased by logistics startup Lalamove from January to July 2022 were electric.
In Southeast Asia, however, logistics startups are facing varied levels of EV adoption.
Cutting emissions and costs
Mober had only two electric vans in 2021, but by March 2024 the startup had 57. For the rest of the year, Ng plans to retire all of Mober’s 140 internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and purchase electric ones instead.
His aggressive adoption of EVs is driven by the savings his startup already enjoys on operational costs. Ng says the cost of operating an EV per kilometer is less than US$0.02, while an ICE vehicle would amount to as much as US$0.19 per kilometer.
For one, EVs are not susceptible to volatile fuel prices. The units are also fully utilized, as they may be driven seven days a week, in contrast to just six days for ICE vehicles.
The Philippine government typically restricts ICE units from national roads at least once a week during rush hours, depending on their plate numbers. EVs are exempted until 2030, as part of the government’s efforts to encourage adoption.
For Nguyen Nguyen, CEO of electric motorcycle and battery pack manufacturer Selex Motors, helping logistics companies switch to EVs is the “lowest-hanging fruit” for electrification in the transportation sector. The Vietnam-based firm counts Gojek, Grab, Shopee, and Lazada as clients in the country.

The firm’s customers either help their drivers acquire a Selex Motors electric bike or purchase them as part of their delivery fleet. “The logistics sector is particularly driven by cost-reduction, and on some level, for other companies, carbon footprint reduction,” Nguyen says.

Blitz Electric (Blitz), an Indonesia-based last-mile delivery startup, is also vying for net profitability by the end of 2024 with help from its use of EVs. Its founder and CEO, Saivya Chauhan, tells Tech in Asia that he wants to run a logistics company that would allow riders to have higher earnings than when driving with ride-hailing or on-demand delivery startups.
He says the only way to do that is by driving down operational costs. “Inherently, EVs are cheaper to run and maintain than fuel-operated motorcycles. Its acquisition cost may be the only hindrance for many drivers [to switch],” he says.
An Asia Development Bank study on the use of EVs in Indonesia estimated the average price of an electric bike in the country at US$1,478, about 30% more expensive than a gasoline-powered one.
To fill that financing gap, Blitz purchases EVs directly from manufacturers and offers a staggered payment scheme that would allow drivers to own the EVs they drive on the platform.
For US$49 a month, drivers may eventually own the electric motorcycle they acquire from Blitz after 36 months of payment. The total cost would be at about a 17% premium of the average price of electric bikes sold in the country, but Chauhan adds that the bikes are of premium quality too.
He says they “can’t afford to have cheap e-bikes” for logistics purposes, as some have broken down in the streets of Jakarta due to overcapacity in handling cargo. “We can’t afford to have my clients’ logos plastered on our bikes and have their customers see that on the road.”
Blitz calls itself a “white-label logistics firm,” meaning its clients can rebrand its fleet of e-bikes to fit their brand identities. The startup’s patented platform also allows clients to have control over the fleets they employ from Blitz.

To make operations more efficient, Blitz seeks drivers who are nearby to its clients’ facilities, whether that may be a Lazada warehouse in Jakarta or a Domino’s Pizza store in the middle of Denpasar. This way, the platform ensures that riders only drive in distances that their bikes’ fully charged batteries can accommodate.
“Because the distance between two locations is so short, no driver ever travels more than 150 kilometers a day, and that’s how much a bike can hold,” Chauhan adds.

Brian Ma, managing partner at Iterative VC, tells Tech in Asia that the main reason he invested in Blitz is not even because of its use of EVs but because of its patented delivery optimization platform.
“EVs are not Blitz’s core product and not the reason why we invested. Blitz delivers reliable same-day deliveries that just happen to use EV bikes,” Ma says. “They’re a SaaS software company, and we think this setup will allow them to grow quickly and achieve profitability.”
Charging challenge
As EV charging stations remain few and far between across Indonesia, Blitz also requires its partner clients to install a battery swapping station in their facilities so its drivers can easily recharge their vehicles.
This lack of infrastructure is what keeps logistics companies with EVs in their fleet from expanding beyond city centers.
Indonesian super app Gojek, which uses EVs for its logistics services such as GoSend and GoBox in Jakarta, says the “availability of charging and battery swapping stations is one of the key challenges in accelerating the EV transition in Indonesia.”

As of 2023, there were 2,704 charging stations in the country with most found in Jakarta, a Gojek representative tells Tech in Asia. That is a far cry from the 6,729 recorded number of fuel stations in the entire country as of 2022.
Mober, for example, had to build its own charging facility to support its operations in the Philippines.
Its first and only charging station is in Pasay City in Metro Manila, just 1.5 kilometers away from the main store of Ikea Philippines. Through its patented app, Mober also optimizes the routes of its drivers to ensure that each fully charged EV is maximized.
Mober’s Ng admits that having one charging station will not be enough soon. To support its expansion, Mober is using the US$2 million funding it raised last February to establish a new charging station in the province of Laguna, located about two hours from Manila.

“Eventually, we will also open our charging stations to other logistics companies for a fee. By the time the window of Mober [as market leader in EV adoption] closes up, we are ready with charging stations for the other logistics players,” he adds.
Cost barriers
While Ng has a clear plan now on how to fully adopt EVs into the firm’s operations, things have not always been smooth sailing.
He says his company faced tight scrutiny from banks, as financial institutions in the Philippines are often hesitant about offering loans to companies operating in unfamiliar sectors.
“As the pioneer in the logistics industry, even the banks are uncertain of what could happen to these electric vehicles in terms of their maintenance needs in five to seven years,” he says. “So that is the main challenge for us — the uncertainty.”

Ride-hailing giant Grab has also publicly admitted that there is uncertainty on the resale value of EVs and that the related costs are roadblocks for many of its drivers to transition to EV use.
While Grab isn’t a logistics company per se, its on-demand delivery service contributed to about half of the company’s total revenue in 2023.

“For EVs to really scale, and to really help our drivers transition, it needs to be inclusive and affordable to the masses,” Cheryl Goh, Grab vice president for marketing and sustainability said in a conference in 2022.
EV push by SEA countries
Across Southeast Asia, governments are racing to shell out incentives for the mainstream use of EVs in their countries. Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam have all targeted to have a part of their country’s public transport needs met by EVs at least by 2030.
All countries, except Singapore and the Philippines, have also mandated incentives to encourage the local manufacturing of EVs in their respective constituencies.

But logistics startups interviewed for this story are the first to admit that more must be done.
“We know we cannot do this alone,” a Gojek representative says. “Strong collaboration [among the government and the industry] will be crucial to deliver the best product and address the challenges to EV adoption.”",Logistics firms in Southeast Asia are turning to electric vehicles for cost savings.

Hi readers,
Writing about someone’s nanny was not on my bingo card for 2024.
I make no apologies. The story you are (hopefully) about to read has a lot of details about things that have nothing to do with tech and everything to do with an ongoing fight in the Singapore courts.
This is yet another story in the saga of the Cake Group, the parent company of Bake, formerly known as Cake DeFi. If you don’t know, they were once big in the decentralized finance crypto space, managing almost US$1 billion in customer assets. Last Friday, a hearing was held in Singapore’s Supreme Court to determine if the company should be liquidated.
I know. That doesn’t offer any clarity on why I’m writing about a nanny. You’ll have to read the story for that, which also has references to people like Toby Hoenisch, founder of crypto wallet TenX, and incidents such as the Dao hack of 2016.
All of these details focus on Julian Hosp, who is the CEO of the Cake Group. He wasn’t very thrilled about the story either, judging from this tweet.
A lot of people online have asked why we didn’t focus more on U-Zyn Chua, the former CTO of Cake, who initiated the current case. The short answer is: We couldn’t get Hosp to talk to us, although we’re still hoping he will. We still want to hear his side of the story.

Hello reader,
When I saw the funding data for this week’s newsletter, I had to triple-check the figure for this week’s biggest funding round: a whopping US$1.5 billion invested into Emirati AI startup G42 by tech giant Microsoft.
I even googled the news and checked a few sources, because it’s been a while since this newsletter has seen a number that big (the tech winter sure sucks, eh?) and I had to make sure I wasn’t seeing things.
This really emphasizes the incredible interest and excitement around AI, which has so far been one of the few sectors that’s weathering – and honestly, perhaps even thriving in – this storm.
AI could be truly transformative, and it could herald a new era of how we understand and interact with technology and the world around us. That’s some exciting stuff.

❌ “It might seem like complaining but we didn’t get an investment from them. That is fine but for the time and effort that the process took up, it was a complete waste of time. A lot of back and forth, meeting up, several video calls, all of which were filled with question after question and us teaching them.” – Read more   
✅︎ “The team at Appworks is very tuned into the founder’s mindset, and well informed about markets and geographies. The overall fundraise process was smooth. The highlight of it was towards the end where we had an hour long session in which ~20 people from the Appworks team interviewed my co-founder and I over Zoom. The questions asked during this session were thought-provoking, consequently requiring reaching deep into our experience and thought processes.” – Read more

844012,2024-04-20T04:00:29,2024-04-16T03:28:42,The road to Vietnam’s net-zero future is paved with electric vehicles,road-vietnams-netzero-future-paved-electric-vehicles,publish,post,https://www.techinasia.com/road-vietnams-netzero-future-paved-electric-vehicles,"Vietnam has less than thirty years to achieve a major goal: having net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.
One avenue to hit this target involves limiting – and eventually stopping – the import and manufacture of vehicles powered by fossil fuels. Subsequently, the country will look to transition almost all vehicles in the country – cars, motorcycles, buses, and even inland waterway vessels – into using renewable energy sources.
This is a lofty ambition, especially considering that Vietnam is a major motorcycle manufacturing hub. Honda Vietnam, for one, currently owns and operates three factories in the country with a production capacity of 2.5 million motorcycles a year.

Electric vehicles (EVs) will be a vital piece of the puzzle for the country to reach its objective and will play a key role in getting fossil fuel-powered vehicles off the streets. That’s why we’re focusing on EVs at Tech in Asia’s upcoming Saigon Summit and will be unpacking the opportunities that lie in the space.
Ahead of the event, Nguyen Nguyen, the co-founder and CEO of Vietnamese EV firm Selex Motors, shares his perspectives on Vietnam’s EV scene and what it takes to be an entrepreneur in the sector.
The following interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.
What inspired you to start your company?
I aspire to drive sustainable development in Vietnam by developing Selex into a Hyundai of Vietnam. For me, sustainable development is not just about the environmental aspect; it also means things like a high quality of product development and value adding in the supply chain.
For Vietnam to reach its full potential, we need to have our own manufacturing champions, like the Hyundais and Samsungs of the world. The EV revolution is just a perfect opportunity – a once-in-a-century one – for us to realize this dream.
What’s exciting about Vietnam’s electric vehicle scene?
Vietnam is the fourth-largest internal combustion engine (ICE) two-wheeler (2W) market in the world. Currently, there are 70 million ICE 2Ws in Vietnam. If all of these vehicles were electric today, they would be worth about US$100 billion. The market potential is staggering. Vietnam is also leading the region in electric 2W market share by a large margin, making up more than 90% of the total market. With the electric 2W market penetration still at around 10% of the total 2W market, the potential to grow is very exciting.

Photo credit: Selex Motors

So far, electric 2W market growth in Vietnam has largely been driven by the private sector. But the Vietnam government is developing policies to spur further growth. Our prime minister made a commitment for Vietnam to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. The government also issued a road map for green transportation, limiting the production and import of ICE vehicles after 2040 and requiring that all vehicles on the road must be green by 2050. Given this context, the market for EVs is bound to see explosive growth in the coming years.
What’s the biggest challenge you’ve faced so far on your entrepreneurial journey?
Surviving two years of Covid-19. When Covid-19 hit, I realized that It could last really long, and almost everything would be frozen. It almost certainly meant death for a pre-revenue EV startup like us. Our runway was less than six months.
To survive, we needed to do multiple things: cut costs, find a way to generate cash, and. pivot our product to better fit with the new normal. Even with all of that done, it might not be sufficient to survive. But we needed to do something fast. So we decided to reduce everyone’s salary and developed automatic hand sanitizers to generate quick cash. Although the salary reduction caused almost half of the employees to quit, our hand sanitizers were sold like hot cakes after only two months of development. It was a miracle that we could develop the products within only two months during unpredictable lockdowns. The team basically stayed in the office and workshop to work on the project non-stop.
The cash generated from selling the automatic hand sanitizers helped us stay afloat during the challenging time. Our hand sanitizer story was appreciated by the public and got featured by national leading news channels.

In parallel, we pivoted our product from high-end B2C vehicles to B2B- and logistics-focused solutions. During the pandemic, the delivery sector was one of the few sectors that was thriving, and thanks to the pivot, we were able to acquire Lazada Logistics as our first customer and were able to raise our first VC round. We came out of the pandemic stronger than ever before, with doubled headcounts and a new factory set up.
What advice do you want to give to aspiring entrepreneurs?
Your dream needs to be big and meaningful enough for you to devote your whole life to achieving it. Grit and adaptability – not talent – are what will take you through ups and downs.
And yes, one can build an automotive startup from scratch in Southeast Asia. Selex Motors was founded in a small 10 square meter room in a university with nothing but an idea.
What will you be speaking about at Tech in Asia’s Saigon Summit and why is it important?
Vietnam is such an exciting market for EVs, and I want to share my firsthand experience of the industry at this event. I hope that the attendees, especially potential investors and partners, will have a better perspective about Vietnam’s EV potential and greater interest in the sector after the event.

Hear more from Nguyen, as well as a host of other exciting speakers, at Tech in Asia’s upcoming Saigon Summit. Held on May 30 at GEM Center, Ho Chi Minh City, we’re bringing together some of Southeast Asia’s best and brightest to chart Vietnam’s tech future together.

(From left) Arya.ai founders Deekshith Marla and Vinay Kumar Sankarapu, and Aurionpro CEO Ashish Rai / Photo credit: Aurionpro

Indian software firm Aurionpro is set to buy Mumbai-based Arya.ai, a platform-as-a-service startup focusing on banking and insurance, for US$16.5 million. The deal involves a 67% share purchase through an all-cash transaction, Aurionpro said in a statement.
The deal comes amid a nationwide push for AI in India, which includes a plan for the government to help local startups and other stakeholders procure chips from Nvidia.
One such startup is Arya.ai. Founded in 2013, the company offers plug-and-use AI APIs, among other things, for clients like Nvidia, Reliance General Insurance, and Forbes.
It last raised funding in 2015 – a US$750,000 pre-series A round from Your Next Angel Fund and Venture Nursery.
According to Arya.ai CEO Vinay Kumar, the company has been growing 3x year on year “in the last couple of years” and has been profitable.
The acquisition will let Aurionpro – which focuses on digital transformation for clients in the banking, mobility, and government sectors – expand its fintech abilities. The company will also benefit from Arya.ai’s AI capabilities, with plans to merge the latter’s AI cloud platform with its own.
“To make [AI] acceptable in a highly regulated industry like banking or insurance, it needs to be stable, reliable, explainable, auditable, compliant, and safe to use,” said Kumar. “Together with Aurionpro, we are going to build a new generation of enterprise AI software for banks and insurers that truly embed AI.”

Indian quick commerce unicorn Zepto has failed to agree on a sale to Flipkart, sources told The Economic Times, dashing the ecommerce giant’s bid for a foothold in India’s instant delivery space.
Flipkart had proposed buying a large stake in Zepto at a valuation of just under US$2 billion. However, the two companies could not agree on Flipkart’s request to gain controlling interest, even with Zepto founders continuing to run the company.
With the deal falling through, the report mentioned that Zepto is negotiating with private equity investors and existing backers to raise a new funding round. The company expects a valuation nearing US$2.5 billion – nearly double the valuation from its previous round – amid the recent momentum in India’s quick commerce space.
While Flipkart declined to comment for the article, Zepto CEO Aadit Palicha stated that the firm isn’t looking for strategic investors, and that he doesn’t comment on market rumors.
A report by consulting firm Redseer estimated India’s quick commerce space to reach US$5 billion in size by 2025. While the space has struggled in Indonesia, Indian consumers have even branched into ordering beauty products via this model.
Flipkart isn’t the only Indian giant to face setbacks in this space. Last year, Reliance-owned JioMart closed down its quick commerce pilot, while Reliance-backed quick commerce startup Dunzo reportedly slashed 300 jobs.

Hello reader,
Ride-hailing has become a way of life in Southeast Asia. I can’t remember the last time I flagged down a cab on the street.
If I need a ride, I open up my Grab or Gojek app, tap a few buttons, and off I go I feel a little safer as well: If anything goes wrong, at least there’s a record of the ride on the platform.
It’s been over a decade since ride-hailing made its debut in the region, and the industry has evolved and matured.
Grab’s still the biggest fish in the pond, but many other contenders have emerged, offering new business models or approaches to ride-hailing. But will they be able to take on the behemoth that is Grab? We explore this question in today’s premium story.
Today we look at:

Whether Grab can remain at forefront of Southeast Asia’s ride-hailing race

The state of Southeast Asia’s ride-hailing scene

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Grab is the leader in Southeast Asia’s ride-hailing space, commanding around 70% market share. Its competitors are not slowing down, though, as funding rounds, public listings, and expansion moves are on the rise across the sector. All this activity, however, does raise the question: Is Grab’s ride-hailing business future-proof?


The current state of affairs: Grab capitalized on a period of low interest rates from 2008 to early 2022 to acquire both customers and drivers, allowing it to establish itself in the market. But that  era of “easy money” is over, and it’s more challenging for ride-hailing players nowadays. 

Differentiation at play: Despite these conditions, Grab’s rivals aren’t giving up. While they’re not necessarily challenging Grab’s dominance, they’re experimenting with alternate models designed to offer customers and drivers more choices.They’re also exploring opportunities in areas such as electric vehicles and expanding into markets like Laos, where Grab isn’t active. 

Not resting on its laurels: For its part, Grab continues to roll out new services, such as a group rides feature, and is still investing in its mobility business.

1️⃣ Fishy business
Tepbac, Vietnam’s answer to Indonesian agriculture unicorn eFishery, is looking to raise US$10 million to US$20 million in funding to scale its business. Starting out as an informational website for shrimp farmers, Tepbac now offers farm management software and IoT devices. It also operates an ecommerce marketplace for farm supplies and a network of aquaculture labs.
2️⃣ Vroom, vroom
Vietnamese electric vehicle maker VinFast has recorded US$618.3 million in net loss in the first quarter of 2024 – more than double its entire revenue in the same period. Though it delivered 9,689 EVs in Q1 – a 4x year-on-year increase – it is still far from its goal of rolling out 100,000 EVs by year-end.
3️⃣ India 🤝 Nvidia?
India is contemplating a purchase agreement with AI chip giant Nvidia as part of the country’s US$1.1 million Artificial Intelligence Mission program. Should it push through, the program aims to offer the Nvidia graphics processing units at subsidized prices to startups, researchers, and academic institutions. Talks, however, are in the “very early stage.”
4️⃣ How ya doin’, Ernie?
Just 13 months after its launch, Ernie Bot – Chinese search giant Baidu‘s large language model (LLM) – has reached over 200 million users and 85,000 corporate clients.  Baidu also unveiled three new Ernie-based tools to help developers create applications and models, some of which don’t require coding.

Cancer has grown more prevalent in recent years, but in lower-income countries, comprehensive treatment is often inadequate, according to the World Health Organization.
That includes Indonesia, where local biotech startup PathGen Diagnostik Teknologi says only 18% of healthcare facilities can conduct molecular cancer testing. To address this, the company has created easy-to-use, PCR-based genetic testing kits for various cancers, including colorectal, lung, cervical, and nasopharynx cancers.
Recently, PathGen secured an undisclosed amount of funding from East Ventures and Royal Group Indonesia. The new capital will mainly go toward the startup’s research and development, technological upgrades, market growth, and other operational aspects.
Founded in 2020, PathGen is developing next-generation sequencing for the diagnosis of cancer and other diseases. A big part of its strategy is to create an affordable way to profile diseases.
PathGen has partnered with BioFarma, an Indonesian state-owned pharmaceutical company, to produce and distribute its inaugural product. The startup is also developing a digital pathology and AI platform to increase diagnosis accuracy and precision.
While biotech has been relatively nascent in Indonesia, a local laboratory chain called Diagnos recently acquired Asa Ren, an Indonesian DNA testing startup, for US$24 million.
Healthcare has also become a recent focus for East Ventures. Last October, during the 2023 Tech in Asia Conference, the firm said it had committed US$30 million to a new dedicated fund for healthcare investments.

Oracle Corporation Japan is earmarking over US$8 billion for investment over the next 10 years to address the country’s rising need for cloud computing and AI infrastructure.
The move follows other major tech firms that have invested in Japan. Microsoft, for example, plans to spend US$2.9 billion over two years to boost its cloud computing and AI infrastructure there, while OpenAI set up its first Asian office in Tokyo this month.
For Oracle, the goal is to broaden Oracle Cloud Infrastructure’s (OCI) reach throughout Japan, the company said in a statement. It plans to bolster customer support teams for its public cloud regions in Tokyo and Osaka and boost local operations teams for Oracle Alloy – its cloud infrastructure platform – and OCI cloud region.
Oracle also aims to help its clients and partners comply with digital sovereignty – a requirement by some governments to regulate digital operations and cloud use. This includes helping Japan’s public and private sectors migrate their workloads to Oracle Cloud.
Just this week, Oracle announced that it will offer free AI training to 10,000 students and professionals in Singapore. The tech giant plans to launch its second data center in the city-state by July to facilitate this initiative.

That’s how much Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta have collectively spent on buying back their shares since 2013.

The buyback bonanza has been embraced by other tech platforms, too, including Uber, which announced a US$7 billion share buyback in February, and Airbnb, which launched a similar US$6 billion plan the same month.
Fairly recently, Asian tech companies are getting in on the game as well, with Grab and GoTo announcing their first share buyback programs in February and March respectively.
See also: Why Grab’s shares declined despite its ‘strong’ Q4 results

Why buybacks?
A share buyback is one way companies can return capital to shareholders (the other being through dividends).
By reducing the number of outstanding shares, buybacks increase a company’s earnings per share in the hopes that it also sends up the value of the stock.
Investors, however, should be mindful that buybacks do not always guarantee a lower share count. Many tech companies concurrently operate employee stock ownership plans that compensate staff with share options or restricted share units. This has the effect of increasing the company’s outstanding stock.
For example, even though Meituan repurchased and retired 44 million shares worth HK$3.2 billion (US$410 million) in January, it granted another 60 million units to employees in April.

That said, buybacks can sometimes still result in a net reduction of outstanding shares. Alibaba, for instance, estimates that as a result of its buybacks in the fourth quarter of 2023, there was a net decrease of 3.3% in its outstanding shares that year, even after accounting for those issued to employees.
Buyback programs are also a signal that management is confident that the business has enough cash in the bank to cushion any emergencies and may also signal its belief that its shares are currently undervalued.
Other factors more important
All else being equal, buybacks should have a positive impact on a business’ share price.
Tech in Asia analyzed twelve tech companies in Asia: five of the most valuable Chinese firms and seven major Southeast Asian and East Asian players. Half of these companies have announced buybacks, while the other half have not. Our analysis suggests that over the past six months, the latter group outperformed the former.

Of course, one could argue that the companies that announced buybacks may have had an even poorer share price performance had they not done so.
Yet, the results suggest that investors ultimately prioritize other factors, such as performance, over buybacks.
Investors, for instance, cheered when Sea Group released a positive guidance in March in relation to the growth outlook for ecommerce arm Shopee. This sent the company’s stock up 17% following its earnings release.

Similarly, South Korea ecommerce platform Coupang saw its shares jump after it announced it would raise membership fees by nearly 60%.
Neither company has introduced share buyback programs, although Sea did not rule out the possibility of launching one in the future.
No link to revenue growth
Share buybacks, especially when made by a high-growth tech company, may also backfire if they are seen as an admission that the firm lacks attractive investment options for its capital.
However, taking revenue growth as a proxy for the availability of growth opportunities, there doesn’t appear to be a strong correlation between the two.

Certainly, there are companies like PDD Holdings, the parent firm of fast-growing ecommerce platform Temu, for which the return on investment of new opportunities justifies allocating capital to those initiatives instead of returning it to shareholders.
See also: Why SEA should watch out for Shein’s top rival Temu
However, there are also businesses like Grab and GoTo, which are seeing strong top-line growth, that have chosen to allot some of their capital to share buybacks.
Most of the companies we looked at that conducted buybacks did reduce their spending on research and development.

Though, with many big tech firms under pressure to cut costs and raise profitability, the reduction on spending is something that might have happened even without a buyback program.
Not a silver bullet
Among the companies that did announce buybacks it appears that there is a correlation between the amount of shares offered in the program (as a percentage of the company’s overall market cap) and the subsequent performance of the firm’s share price.
Most of the companies we looked at announced their share buyback programs after the release of their results for the quarter ending December 2023. So, we compared the change in share price from that date to the closing price as of April 16 to measure the capital market implications of the move.

One big exception is Alibaba, which saw the worst share performance of the group, even though it announced the largest share buybacks as a percentage of its market cap, at 12.5%.
This could be due to idiosyncratic reasons. The Chinese giant is said to be “struggling to restructure”. It’s changed its top leaders several times and shifted its strategy, which has led to “confusion” among employees.
In March, the firm also called off the public listing of its logistics arm Cainiao, months after shelving plans for its grocery subsidiary Freshippo.
This demonstrates that a share buyback, even a big one, is not a silver bullet and cannot compensate for poor operational performance.","Our sample of twelve Asian tech companies suggests that, over the past six months, those that did not announce buybacks outperformed those who did.",Simon Huang,Editing by Melissa Goh and Jaclyn Tiu,open,0,"",https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1713500584_fi-asia-tech-firms-go-big-on-buybacks-but-outcomes-are-mixed.png,false,"",false,true,true,true,false,4,,898,"Asia tech firms go big on buybacks, but outcomes are mixed","Our sample of twelve Asian tech companies suggests that, over the past six months, those that did not announce buybacks outperformed those who did.",,,"","",""

And when you get as big as the insurance sector – now a multitrillion-dollar market – it becomes even more challenging.
That’s why insurance companies need to focus on what’s truly important: being a “people business” that focuses on improving lives. For Neetha Nair, Prudential Singapore’s chief human resources officer, that includes employees.

“It’s really important to us that we are able to create value for our employees and make a difference in their lives,” she says.
In this regard, technology has become an “enabler” for the firm’s employees, she adds. To provide a positive employee experience, Prudential seeks to equip team members with the right tools to not only foster strong connections and well-being, but also support their growth and meet their learning needs in their careers.
Better and faster with tech
Since 2016, the company has been investing in tech and training employees on skills such as design thinking for problem solving, along with other agile processes. In 2020, Prudential began offering employees certification courses that focused on machine learning.
Thanks to the creation of this flexible and digital work culture, Prudential was able to “quickly pivot to remote work and client servicing” when the pandemic hit, says Nair. For example, its PRURemote Advice (PRA) video servicing solution was developed during the pandemic in just seven days, and it has since been embedded in the company’s regular business processes and enhanced with remote signing solutions.

Prudential has also been exploring opportunities with automation and AI. In 2019, it introduced an instant underwriting engine that can perform real-time risk assessments on policy applications and make underwriting decisions almost immediately.
In 2022, the company launched an AI-enabled talkbot called Grace, which it uses for processes such as payment reminders for customers. Additionally, for the past year, Prudential has been piloting the use of genAI tools like Microsoft Copilot to help employees improve productivity.
These are just a few examples of how digital solutions help the company automate and streamline work.
“Collaboration between people and technology can create value in many areas by allowing employees to focus on more important tasks,” Nair points out. In turn, this boosts productivity and benefits the customers.
Well-done wellness in the digital age
Employee well-being emerged as a flashpoint during the Covid-19 crisis, with mental health challenges rising in Asian workforces.
“Personal well-being in the workplace has become so important in recent years,” says Nair.
To tackle this, Prudential has built up an ecosystem that supports its employees’ well-being – both physically and emotionally. For one, it offers a network of well-being coaches to help workers cope with anxiety and stress.
This extends to the digital realm too – there are regular online wellness initiatives to help employees’ mental, emotional, and physical well-being. They can join online meditation and fitness sessions as well as webinars that focus on stress management, nutrition, and sleep hygiene.

Technology is playing a role in improving employee well-being as well, with data analytics being used to better manage performance and identify healthier workplace practices. For example, data revealed that existing meeting practices were leaving less time for employees to focus on work that mattered, so Prudential moved to reduce the durations of meetings.
“These initiatives have led to an overall 8% increase in the company’s well-being index,” says Nair. “If you break that down, you’ll see a 12% improvement in employee’s ability to focus and be effective and a 15% improvement in personal energy management.”
Tech-enabled pathways to alternative careers
While tech has been instrumental in enhancing the employee experience, that’s just one aspect of workplace development. Prudential also looks to support its staff’s careers through various initiatives – one of which is the Career Conversion Program (CCP), an employee upskilling and reskilling course held over three to 24 months.
The program has already helped 150 employees, including Chrystal Ang, a sustainability manager who wanted to level up her skill sets in sustainability.

“I was previously working on policy and research in the civil service, so this was an entirely new field to me,” Ang says. “The learning curve was rather steep at the start especially because sustainability is such a broad topic.”
Taking part in the CCP provided the necessary structure and discipline that enabled her to better focus on studying while learning on the job.
However, Ang says that juggling both work and courses could be challenging, especially during peak periods. To that end, Prudential supported her efforts with the tech to take charge of her learning.
“Digital tools like Udemy’s e-learning platform gave me the flexibility to attend many of the CCP courses at my own pace,” she explains. “I could phase out my coursework when work got busy and come back to it when time freed up.”
Remaining people-centric and inclusive
As Prudential invests in additional efforts – including tech-enabled ones – the company will continue to focus on inclusivity, which Nair says is an essential ingredient to great performance and well-being.
For example, the firm launched the Courageous Leadership program to support managers in creating a diverse and inclusive environment where employees can be themselves and thrive at work. Prudential has also removed the retirement age requirement and extended the duration of parental leaves.
Moving ahead, Prudential will continue to work on strengthening its human-centered, digitally enabled approach to help employees “connect with their colleagues and culture, and take ownership of their careers and performance.”
“Prudential Singapore is committed to creating a place where our employees can connect, grow, and succeed with us,” says Nair. “This commitment is closely tied to our company’s purpose: ‘for every life, for every future.’ It is important that we start living our purpose by making a difference in our employees’ lives.”

Prudential Singapore is one of the country’s top life insurance companies, having served the financial and protection needs of citizens for 92 years. It delivers a suite of products in areas such as protection, savings, and investments through multiple distribution channels.

Apple has removed Meta-owned WhatsApp and Threads from its App Store in China, The Wall Street Journal reported. This follows a 2023 law from Chinese authorities that requires the removal of unregistered or outdated apps on iOS’ and Android’s app stores.
The removal comes amid an increasingly tense climate between the US and China on tech products, which include a chip war and a possible TikTok ban by the US government.
For its part, Apple justified the removal of the two apps by citing its need to comply with local laws, following an order by China’s internet regulator.
Most foreign social media platforms like WhatsApp can’t be accessed in China unless a VPN is used, due to the country’s internet restrictions. However, this removal further restricts Chinese users’ access to US-made platforms.
Beijing mandated all app developers to register with its government by the end of March, with warnings by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of strict action against unregistered apps.
In the US, the House of Representatives passed a bill last month that would ban TikTok in the country unless the short-video app’s parent firm, ByteDance, divests its interest in the platform. The bill will still need to go through Senate approval before being made into law.

Social media giant Meta has unveiled Meta Llama 3, the third version of its open-source large language model. The LLM is now available on a newly released version of the Meta AI virtual assistant, said founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg in an Instagram video.
In addition, Llama 3 will soon be deployed on cloud computing platforms such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, the company said in a statement. It will be supported by hardware platforms from the likes of Nvidia, Intel, and AMD.
Unlike Llama 2, which was released mid last year, Llama 3 uses pre-trained and refined language models with 8 billion and 70 billion parameters, respectively. Meta claims that the LLM has performed better on several benchmarks compared to Google’s Gemini Pro 1.5 and the Claude 3 Sonnet, among others.
Llama 3 is currently a text-based LLM supporting the English language, but Meta said that it aims to make it multilingual and multimodal “in the near future.” As Zuckerberg pointed out in his post, Meta AI is now integrated into the search boxes on top of WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, and Messenger, though the feature is not yet live in all countries.
Aside from OpenAI and Google, Meta’s heightened competition in the AI sphere also includes Chinese tech giants like Baidu, whose chatbot has breached 200 million users over a year after launch.
Meanwhile, startups like Reka AI have also launched language models that rival those from big players.

It was moderately edited to reflect Tech in Asia’s editorial guidelines.
Pakistan’s startup ecosystem, not unlike other emerging market ecosystems, is traversing a tumultuous period. The end of 2021’s VC funding fury has caused a sobering hangover.
Startups whose plans relied on the certitude of future rounds have drowned as the funding wave receded. Global VC winter has deprived Pakistan of what had pushed its startups to record highs in 2021: foreign investors. Many have lost interest in the country as they deal with their own issues.

Image credit: Timmy Loen

In Pakistan’s case, the funding winter is complemented by an internal “polycrisis,” as the country battles hard-headed inflation, persistent political instability, and an uneasy relationship with its national debt. The calamitous floods of late 2022 added insult to injury.
The accompanying decline in quality of life has led to the devastating draining of Pakistan’s human capital. The number of Pakistanis leaving the country in 2022 tripled compared to 2021.
Much to the ecosystem’s dismay, prime candidates for emigration are tech workers, whose skills remain in high demand abroad. One can’t blame a person supporting a family for seeking stability and a better salary.
For those who stay, tech startup jobs’ allure has significantly decreased compared to the golden 2021 era, when Pakistanis in the diaspora flocked back home to work in local tech.
All of these unfortunate circumstances have resulted in one overarching truth: the contraction of Pakistan’s startup scene. There are fewer VCs, startups, and rounds, yet less available talent.
But that adversity can be turned into a positive.
Responsible is cool again
2021’s funding bonanza generated a substantial number of “high burn, low margins” startups throughout the ecosystem. More often than not, these startups shared two main traits.
First, many were so-called “copycats” of a similar startup that had functioned elsewhere. Second, the bulk of their funding came from foreign VCs, carried by that year’s overwhelming bullish sentiment.
Such startups, basking in Silicon Valley narratives, assumed they should follow the traditional startup playbook: Scale fast, dominate the market, and worry about profitability later.
This playbook relies on the assumption that one will keep on raising, given satisfactory top-line growth. Mystified by 2021’s adrenaline, founders forgot a crucial component: Pakistan’s VC scene is not the Bay’s.
When the 2022 perfect storm ensued, a domino effect of doom mixing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, soaring energy prices, rising interest rates, and inflation, those swimming naked were exposed. As foreign VCs left in droves and Pakistan-focused investors became more demanding on unit economics, abandoning the notion of “growth at all costs,” some startups failed to raise and eventually died.
That’s what killed firms like Airlift, the ecosystem’s former flag bearer.
Those companies that survived, either through pivoting or by adopting a better business model from the get-go, have passed an important resilience litmus test. The startups remaining in the ecosystem today have their eyes on saner unit economics.
Fintech companies in particular have benefitted, buoyed by inherently cheaper operating expenses and encouraging progress in Pakistan’s regulatory environment.
VCs investing in Pakistan now – some of whom are Pakistani, while others are international VCs – value capital efficiency as much as a good idea.
Unbothered by noisy international hype, the Pakistani ecosystem is focused on solving unglamorous yet fundamental issues: better governance, swift legislation, and saner business models.

Mitigating risk and new ideas
The uncertainty regarding the length of Pakistan’s socioeconomic slump has forced local founders to bake “Pakistan risk mitigation” within their models.
Widely used strategies include selling abroad, in Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates for example, bypassing the weakened Pakistani market. Hiring for fractional roles has also helped cut costs and maintain capital efficiency. Fractional hires also slightly mitigate the country’s talent brain drain, exacerbated by the aforementioned internal challenges.
Severe, local market constraints have also reinforced the need for hyperlocal innovation, in line with the challenges Pakistan faces. Startups are disrupting critical industries such as earned wage access or remittance payments. The onus has shifted from replicating what works abroad to building what is needed locally.
Cautious optimism
The combination of a stunted global venture market and distressing internal turmoil has been a lot to stomach. The ecosystem’s landing from its 2021 peak has been perilous, to say the least. As I previously stated, that year’s impact on Pakistan’s ecosystem is multifaceted.
It infused new ambition and energy into Pakistani startups, showing ourselves and the world that we could build, raise, and grow tech startups in the country. It also led to a painful reckoning of what could and could not work in Pakistan, given the market conditions we face.
Even as it contracts, the ecosystem is working on the right things: useful and healthy businesses, the incorporation of governance best practices, and creative ways to integrate into Pakistan’s economy without being endangered by it.
The current lack of international interest is strengthening our local VC industry, which is still undersized compared to our ecosystem’s potential. Bringing back foreign VCs into the country should be a priority, as local VCs generally don’t have the coffers to invest post-series A.
That being said, I still find myself feeling cautiously optimistic about the future of Pakistan’s startup ecosystem.

In a rare exit for Indonesia’s still-nascent biotech space, PT Diagnos Laboratorium Utama, a listed laboratory chain based in Jakarta, has announced plans to acquire Asa Ren, a DNA testing company, according to documents filed with the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX).
Diagnos aims to purchase a nearly 98% stake in Asa Ren, which is incorporated in Singapore but operates in Indonesia, for US$24 million. The deal will be done in a mix of equity (90%) and cash (10%).
Founded in 2016, Asa Ren is a digital biobank enterprise. It raised US$8.2 million in seed funding in February 2023 from investors like Kejora Capital, Northstar Ventures, and Diagnos.
Asa Ren claims to be the world’s most diverse biobank, with datasets encompassing Indonesia’s many ethnicities. Among its goals is to expedite drug discoveries, forecast infectious outbreaks, and optimize personalized therapies.
Diagnos has six locations across five cities in Indonesia and also offers a genomics lab as well as home care services. The company posted US$9 million in revenue with a net loss of US$846,000 for 2023.
Its shareholders are entities related to the Bunda chain of maternity hospitals, which is also listed on the IDX. Diagnos chairman Ivan Sini is also the co-founder and chairman of Moosa Genetics, an Indonesian cattle genetics startup.
Diagnos went public on the IDX in 2021. As of market close on April 18, it had US$27.5 million in market capitalization.

India’s housing loan market was troubled during the Covid-19 pandemic but appears to be recovering. Valued at US$300 billion, the space is expected to have a compound annual growth rate of 22.5% over the next five years.
At the same time, lower-income groups remain underserved, lacking access to long-term credit – including housing mortgages – from established financial institutions.
That’s the need that India-based Altum Credo aims to fulfill. The housing finance firm recently secured US$40 million in a series C equity round.












Z3Partners and Oikocredit led the round, with British International Investment, Aavishkaar Capital, and Amicus Capital participating. While US$27 million of the amount was an equity fundraise, the remaining US$13 million facilitated a partial exit to its series A investors.
Launched in June 2017, Altum Credo uses tech across its entire loan lifecycle, and applicants can apply for the loans online. First-time homeowners from the weaker economic section and the low-income group represent 93% of Altum Credo’s customers.
The fresh funds will help Altum Credo boost its assets (currently worth US$100 million), enhance distribution, and expand operations. Moving forward, the company plans to expand into central and northern India.
Aside from India and its fragmented housing loan space, Indonesia has also seen startups tackling the mortgage fintech space. More recently, Singapore-based LXA – which aims to streamline the mortgage lifecycle – raised a US$10 million seed round in late 2023.

Hello reader,
Just two days ago, Singapore announced that Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong will be sworn in as the country’s fourth Prime Minister on May 15.
This move marks the end of a significant period in Singapore’s politics. The outgoing Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong, held the position for close to 20 years, seeing the country through some of its toughest times such as the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 and the Covid-19 pandemic.
Respect where it’s due: While I may disagree on some political fronts, I do think that the country has made strong progress, and we’ve generally had a good life during Lee’s tenure. We’re now looking at a new era in Singapore politics marked by (relatively) fresh faces and, hopefully, newer and better ways of doing things.
Leadership changes like these always have a big impact, and the same applies to companies. That’s why we’ve come up with a list that covers all the recent leadership changes in tech and tech-adjacent companies from Southeast Asia and India. You can read more about it in our premium story for today.
Today we look at:

The high-level moves at Southeast Asian and Indian tech firms 
A cloud startup securing US$1 million in seed funding 
Other newsy highlights such as Oracle offering free AI training in Singapore and Microsoft’s US$1.5 billion investment in a UAE-based AI firm.

Everyday I’m shufflin’

Good leadership makes or breaks a company, so firms are always looking for the best people for the role. Also, leadership changes can sometimes make for good gossip, if you’re into that kind of thing.
All jokes aside, let’s check out some of the biggest and latest moves among tech execs in Southeast Asia and India.


Stepping up: The most recent change (as of writing this newsletter) is Damien Schricke stepping down from his SVP role in Lazada and joining Decathlon as its head of ecommerce for Asia Pacific. The move was announced on April 17. 

Quick as a flash: One slightly more surprising development that took place recently is the resignation of Byju’s CEO Arjun Mohan. He held the role for just over six months before announcing his resignation on April 15. 

Lateral movement: In other Singapore moves, Haja Mohaideen, who was previously COO at fintech startup Bambu, went over to software firm GoUpscale to be its new COO.

CNV has secured US$1 million in seed funding from Wavemaker Partners. The Vietnam-based cloud solutions company said that this comes after its “stellar performance” in 2022 and 2023. Let’s see what it’s talking about.


SaaS-y products: Founded in 2020, CNV offers SaaS products and marketing services related to digital transformation. These cater to MSMEs and enterprises in Vietnam. 

One big step for CNV-kind: In 2023, CNV hit an important milestone for its mini apps in Vietnamese messaging platform Zalo. It created an app-in-app experience that enabled businesses to acquire users at lower costs and engage them in a “deeper and more seamless manner.” 

Keep pushing: According to CNV’s CEO, the firm intends to use the fresh funds to become a “no-code sales and customer care platform.”

In July 2021, Beijing clamped down on China’s lucrative private tutoring industry, banning for-profit tutoring in core school subjects and restricting foreign investments in the sector. TikTok parent ByteDance, which operates an education arm, was also affected by the decision, leading to layoffs.
Now, however, ByteDance has shifted its edtech plans to the US, and is reaping the rewards, reported South China Morning Post. Gauth, an “AI homework helper” from ByteDance subsidiary GauthTech, was the country’s second-most downloaded education app as of yesterday, behind only Duolingo.
Question.AI, another educational app from Beijing-based startup Zuoyebang, ranked third in the same survey, which was done by Data.ai.
Launched as a math-focused app in 2020, Gauth was formerly known as Gauthmath. The app enables users to get help with their homework by simply snapping a picture of an assignment, such as a page of math exercises, after which the app’s AI will work through the solutions.
According to the Data.ai survey, Gauth is also popular in Canada and the Philippines.
Gauth’s momentum would be a welcome development for ByteDance, whose social media app TikTok has notably faced headwinds in the US. That said, TikTok’s rise across the world has led ByteDance to surpass Tencent in terms of revenue.

Our updated map of the key players in Indonesia’s beauty commerce sector
What TikTok Shop’s success in Vietnam means for SEA


Hi there,
Traveling to Jakarta for the Tech in Asia Conference last year, I was struck by the scale of the shopping malls there. The conference was held in the Pacific Place Mall, which was far larger – and grander – than anything I’ve seen in Singapore.
Indonesia has an abundance of these large malls, which provides plenty of options for brands like Sociolla, the country’s leading online beauty marketplace, to set up its physical stores.
Sociolla, which has over 60 branches across the archipelago, is one of the companies featured in this week’s Big Story – a landscape map of the key players in Indonesia’s beauty commerce space by my colleague Jofie. In March alone, the firm opened new stores in Jakarta, Surabaya, Bogor, and Cirebon.
Esqa, a direct-to-consumer makeup brand, also recently opened its first retail store in the country, located in Pondok Indah Mall 2 in South Jakarta.
However, not all of Indonesia’s beauty commerce brands are doing as well. A number of players, from PamperPop to Newman’s, are no longer active.
While the beauty commerce industry is riding on strong macro trends, this is a timely – if sobering – reminder that most startups don’t end up succeeding.

The key players in Indonesia’s beauty commerce space (update)

THE HOT TAKE
What TikTok’s success in Vietnam means for SEA tech

Photo credit: Ringo Chiu / Shutterstock

Here’s what happened:

TikTok Shop says that it tripled its merchant base and average sales on its app in Vietnam in 2023, according to a Nikkei report.
As of early 2024, some 67 million people in Vietnam use TikTok Shop.
It is the country’s second-largest ecommerce platform by market share, ahead of Lazada but behind Shopee.

Here’s our take:
The incredible growth posted by TikTok Shop in Vietnam shows that its success in Indonesia – which prompted a government crackdown – was not a fluke.
From mobile phones to motorcycles, Vietnamese shoppers are making more of their purchases online.
TikTok’s decision to set up a physical office in Vietnam five years ago was credited as one of the reasons behind its success in the country. This contrasts with other social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube, which still lack a physical presence in the Southeast Asian powerhouse.
However, TikTok’s popularity in Vietnam – it was the most downloaded app there in the last 30 days, according to Data.ai – would likely have occurred even if it didn’t have an office in the country.
Apart from the magic sauce of its algorithm, TikTok moved quickly to capitalize on its success as a social media platform by building ecommerce tools, something that previous dominant players like Facebook were slow to do.
What it also has on its side is a population that is more well-versed with shopping online – compared to a decade ago – as well as more established ecommerce infrastructure, which includes everything from mobile internet connectivity to well-connected logistics networks for deliveries.
The players most directly affected by TikTok Shop’s success are other ecommerce platforms such as Shopee – which was the fifth-most downloaded app in Vietnam in the last 30 days – and Lazada.
For now, the Sea Group subsidiary seems to be keeping pace – its announcement last month that it expects Shopee’s 2024 gross merchandise value growth to be in the “high teens range” sent its share price soaring.
In contrast, Lazada’s outlook is more murky.
Following a large round of layoffs at the start of the year, all parent company Alibaba would say in its most recently released results was that the platform “continues to focus on optimizing its operating efficiency,” with its losses narrowing.
However, other tech platforms should not rest easy, either. As TikTok becomes the new Google for some, many users are also turning to the app to search for everything from travel tips to dining recommendations. It isn’t a stretch to imagine TikTok’s users being offered the chance to buy airline tickets, book hotel rooms, or dining vouchers – or even to order food – through its app.
There’s enough space for more than one player in most markets, of course. Yet, the speed at which TikTok has grown in ecommerce should be a warning to tech players in adjacent businesses as well.

Reka Core ranks second in the ELO rating system / Photo credit: Reka AI

AI company Reka AI has launched Reka Core, its first multimodal language model. Working with images, audio, and video, Core is “competitive” with leading models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google across industry-accepted metrics, the company said in a statement.
Reka AI – which was founded by researchers from DeepMind, Google, and Meta – is based in San Francisco but has two Southeast Asian founders. Singaporean Yi Tay is the company’s chief scientist, while CEO Dani Yogatama grew up in Indonesia.
In addition to being a large language model, Reka Core has “powerful” contextualized understanding of images, videos, and audio. The company said that it is one of just two developers – the other being Google – whose commercially available models allow for comprehensive multimodal input.
Core has a 128,000-token context window, which enables reasoning abilities – including language and math – suitable for tasks that require complex reasoning. It is also a code generator that can empower agentic workflows.
In comparison to similar models in the market, Reka AI claimed that Core outperforms Google’s Gemini Ultra – also a multimodal model – on video tasks. Core is also said to be comparable to GPT-4V on MMMU, an AI benchmark that evaluates how models perform tasks that require university-level knowledge and reasoning.
Core’s launch comes a few months after Reka AI rolled out its Flash and Edge models. The company has raised US$58 million so far, which came in June 2023 from a round led by DST Global Partners and Radical Ventures. Market intelligence platform CB Insights pegs Reka AI’s last known valuation at US$300 million.
Snowflake, Oracle, and AI Singapore are among Reka AI’s partners. It recently ranked fifth among global AI firms on a valuation per employee basis.

“Gray-collar jobs” refer to positions that require more specialized technical skills and training compared to blue-collar work but do not necessarily fit into the traditional corporate office environment. That may seem like a niche proposition, but the post-pandemic hiring crunch may see gray-collar workers as a solution.
The healthcare space, for one, may see a shortage of 10 million skilled workers by 2030, according to the World Health Organization.
That’s an opportunity that Vivek Sinha, the former COO of Indian edtech firm Unacademy, wants to tackle. He recently founded his own edtech startup called Beyond Odds Technologies, which aims to create a high-quality supply of Indian gray-collar workers to solve both local and global manpower needs.
The company has now raised US$11 million in a seed funding round led by Matrix Partners India and Lightspeed. Participating investors include Alteria Capital and Temasek subsidiary InnoVen Capital, along with angel investors Ritesh Agarwal from Oyo and Gaurav Munjal from Unacademy.
Beyond Odds runs a training, certification, and recruitment platform that targets the gray-collared workforce in sectors like healthcare, education, hospitality, and construction. Through the platform, candidates can enter training programs where industry partners provide “hands-on” coaching.
An upcoming project is higher education brand Emversity, which provides bachelor’s degrees and certificates with university partners, and will open its first center in Bangalore this week. Emversity’s programs include emergency and trauma care, anesthesia, and hospital administration.

Singapore-headquartered SWAT Mobility has raised an additional US$3.8 million of funding as it aims to expand its AI-powered transportation platform across Asia. This extends its total capital raised this round to US$7.2 million, CEO Jarrold Ong confirmed to Tech in Asia.
The fundraise comes amid a mixed outlook for the tech-enabled transport and logistics spaces in Asia. Indian ride-hailer Ola is gunning for an IPO while trimming markets and investing in new areas, while Singapore-headquartered NinjaVan is reeling from a cutthroat logistics price war.
SWAT Mobility, however, operates a unique model by comparison. The company offers AI-powered solutions – primarily to generate efficient travel routes – for clients in the mobility space, including transport operators and government agencies.
Since its founding in 2015, it has also developed a bus boarding and alighting data analysis system, a delivery system for logistics companies, and an on-demand transportation system. It operates in Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines – as well as its biggest market of Japan, where at least 50 companies and local government units use its models.
Among the investors in the new fundraise is NEC &amp; Translink Orchestrating Future Fund, a VC fund managed by US-based Translink Capital and Japan’s NEC Corporation. Other participants include NX Global Innovation Fund – a fund from Tokyo-based logistics services company Nippon Express – as well as Japanese utility firm Chubu Electric Power.
To further support its momentum in Japan, SWAT Mobility has established an engineering team in the country while expanding its sales and customer service departments. Ong says the fresh funding will also help the research and development of its logistics-focused services.
In a statement, the startup said it anticipates greater demand from the sector in Japan, as labor shortages are deemed imminent in the country “due to tightened labor regulations for truck drivers starting in April 2024.”
In 2021, SWAT Mobility was reported to be eyeing an IPO in Japan, though it’s unclear what the plan is currently. CEO Ong says the company aims to be profitable within one to two years.

Tech giant Apple will invest more than US$250 million to expand its campus in Singapore, with construction set to begin later this year. The expansion will provide “space for growth and new roles in artificial intelligence and other key functions,” the company said in a press release.
The expansion works include a “major upgrade” to two buildings Apple acquired in 2022, located adjacent to its existing offices at the Ang Mo Kio neighborhood.
“Like all Apple facilities, the expanded campus will run on 100% renewable energy,” the firm added.
The iPhone maker, which made its initial foray to Singapore in 1981 with 72 employees, now has more than 3,600 staff in the city-state.
“With our growing campus, Apple is writing a new chapter in our history here,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook, who is in the midst of a Southeast Asia tour. “Our Singapore teams have played an important role in enriching the lives of our customers, and we can’t wait for many more decades of innovation to come.”

After some pandemic-related bumps, the Indonesian coffee industry has regained its momentum lately. Players like Fore Coffee and Kopi Kenangan have been expanding to countries like Singapore and Malaysia, while JumpStart Coffee secured funding last year.
Joining the latter is “mobile cafe” company Jago Coffee, which has secured US$6 million in a series A investment. Beenext Accelerate and Intudo Ventures led the round, with Orzon Ventures and D Global Ventures participating.
Founded in 2020, Jago Coffee operates a fleet of fully-electric coffee carts roaming around Jakarta. Customers can use the Jago app to find nearby carts and order directly, or have their coffees delivered within 15 minutes.
It targets low- to middle-income customers, with drinks starting from 8,000 rupiah (about US$0.50) per cup. Jago Coffee’s strategy of balancing affordability and quality has yielded consistent profits, the company said. It also claimed to have grown over 13x in 2023.
The company’s co-founders are Yoshua Tanu, Christopher Oentojo, and Daniel Sidik. CEO Tanu co-founded upscale coffee chain Common Grounds, while CTO Oentojo was a vice president of product at Gojek. COO and CMO Sidik previously co-founded local Korean snack chain Reddog.
The latest investments will support Jago Coffee’s expansion plans – currently serving 7% of Jakarta, the company aims for 50% coverage by 2024. It is also planning upgrades to machine learning models that help find new areas to open at, as well as cart and depot hardware for better forecasting and cost efficiency.

Discontinuing the GrabPay Card can be seen as Grab consciously stepping away from areas of overlap with GXS. / Photo credit: Grab

When news broke earlier this month that ride-hailing giant and fintech platform Grab would discontinue its GrabPay Card issued by Mastercard from June 1, many were quick to see it as a casualty of Grab’s profitability drive.
Indeed, that might have been a factor in Grab’s decision to kill off the product.
But, looking at the bigger picture, cutting the service might point instead to the company pushing the utilization of the payment methods offered by GXS Bank, the digital bank backed by Grab and Singtel.
This seems to be a more plausible scenario, especially when considering the roots of the GrabPay e-wallet.
GrabPay was initially launched as a way to keep customers within the Grab ecosystem, with the debit card offered as a sweetener.
Rewards for using the GrabPay Card came in the form of Grab loyalty points, which could be used on the platform’s app. The technology company saw this as the start of a virtuous circle, where customers would spend with Grab even if their GrabPay Card transactions went beyond the ecosystem.
Fast forward to today, Grab has undergone the cycle of pain felt by e-wallet operators, who consistently lose money on each transaction as the cost of cash can not be eliminated.
But, GrabPay has an advantage over some e-wallet operators. With a digital bank, it could see some cost savings in handling transactions.
In a market such as Singapore – where the population is highly banked and not lacking for options in debit or credit cards – perhaps retreating from this space is a valid strategy.
After all, users have also complained that the rewards points for GrabPay have lost a lot of luster over the years.
With GXS now in the picture, the GrabPay Card could be seen as potentially cannibalizing the digital bank’s payment business.
With GXS customers acquired from ecosystem partners Grab and Singtel, it would make sense to funnel payment usage through the bank – with lower costs – rather than through GrabPay.
This isn’t the first service that GrabPay has shuttered in Singapore. Last September, it discontinued investment services AutoInvest and Earn+.
While GXS currently does not have any investment products, that is almost certainly on the cards as it looks to double its loan disbursals.
The jettisoning of these extra services does point to Grab consciously stepping away from areas of overlap with its digital bank.
It is a bonus if the jettisoned service was not doing particularly well for Grab.
As this column pointed out before, GXS’ key challenge in its path to profitability is in getting customers to use their accounts.
In that aspect, GXS has not been idle in its efforts.
Interest rates for the main account – with which customers can carry out transactions – have already been boosted to 2.38% from 0.08% in August 2023.
More recently, GXS announced on April 13 that it is offering a higher interest rate of 2.88% on customers’ main accounts with five qualifying transactions. These transactions include paying with a GXS debit card or PayNow and must include a transaction on either the Grab or Dash apps. Dash is an e-wallet owned by Singtel.
GXS will get a cut of the payment transactions made by its customers, and these moves should help increase utilization for the bank as it charts its path to profitability.
This should also support its case for regulators to grant an increase in its deposit cap.
Coupled with growing its loan disbursals, GXS’ case for profitability will likely appear stronger than some of its peers that have yet to offer loans or a debit card.
Even as GrabPay appears to be sounding a retreat, the shrinking of overlaps with GXS means the digital bank will likely reap the benefits.

Tepbac CEO and founder Duy Phong Tran / Photo credit: Tepbac

EFishery became the sole startup admitted to Southeast Asia’s tech unicorn club in 2023 and the world’s first-ever from the aquaculture space.
In Vietnam, one startup is looking to emulate eFishery’s success. Tepbac – which serves 5,000 shrimp farmers in three southern provinces Long An, Ca Mau, and Bac Lieu – is seeking US$10 million to US$20 million in funding to scale its business.
CEO and founder Duy Phong Tran, whose family has been shrimp farmers for over 25 years in Bac Lieu, established Tepbac in 2012.
Initially, it was just an informational website where farmers can get advice about sustainable shrimp farming practices and technology applications.
The company’s business has since diversified, now offering farm management software Farmext. It also offers IoT devices that automate feeding, monitor water quality, and optimize electricity usage in shrimp farms.
Tepbac also operates an ecommerce marketplace for farm supplies, as well as a network of aquaculture labs.
“In the next five years, Tepbac’s goal is to have 80% of shrimp and fish farmers in Vietnam using at least one of our products. Additionally, we plan to expand our solution to India, Thailand, and Indonesia,” Tran tells Tech in Asia in a recent interview.
Tepbac has raised only US$2.3 million so far, a tiny amount compared to eFishery’s total funding of about US$386 million. However, both ventures share Aqua-Spark as a common early-stage investor.
“The Tepbac cofounders were able to build wide-reaching relationships with the Vietnamese smallholder community over the last 12 years through their media platform,” says Maria Velkova, Aqua-Spark investment manager and a board member of Tepbac. “This gives them a huge competitive advantage in their market.” 
Tran believes he’s not in the business of raising a lot of money, though. The only way to compete is to constantly innovate its tech solutions and convince farmers to use them, he says.
For example, its automatic feeder does more than just release feed. It suggests feeding programs based on environmental conditions. Tepbac’s water monitoring device also keeps track of metrics such as pH, temperature, salinity, and oxygen levels.
According to Tran, shrimp farming in Vietnam has a very high mortality rate due to disease outbreaks and climate change effects, posing serious challenges to small and medium-sized farms.
Tran stated that Tepbac’s revenue in 2023 reached approximately 10 billion dong (US$395,500). The startup offers its IoT device package at around US$2,770 and a Farmnext subscription of US$82 per year.
It is also constructing a shrimp farming model in Can Gio, a coastal suburban district of Ho Chi Minh City, to apply its technologies and transfer them to farmers.

VinFast, the Vietnam-based electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer, has recorded US$618.3 million in net loss in the first quarter of 2024 – more than double its entire revenue in the same period.
At US$302.6 million, the company’s Q1 2024 revenue – while significantly higher on a year-on-year basis – is also a 31% drop from Q4 2023. It did deliver 9,689 EVs in Q1, a 4x year-on-year increase, but is still some ways off its goal of delivering 100,000 EVs by year’s end.
That said, VinFast says it remains “committed” to that goal, and expects the majority of deliveries to happen in the second half of this year.
“While VinFast acknowledges ongoing global economic and geopolitical uncertainties, we view them as temporary hurdles,” said Thuy Le, VinFast’s chairperson, in a statement.
In April, the company – a subsidiary of Vietnamese conglomerate Vingroup – opened its first dealership in Indonesia and announced its plan to open 22 showrooms in Bangkok. That came two months after VinFast opened a US$500-million manufacturing plant in India to support its expansion in the country, as well as across South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.
On top of the worldwide expansion, the company also has new models on the pipeline, including the VF 3 – its most affordable model – in Vietnam. It also intends to launch the VF 7 and VF 9 SUVs in North America.
However, VinFast recorded US$1.2 billion in annual revenue for 2023, along with US$2.3 billion in net loss.

India is contemplating a purchase agreement with AI chip giant Nvidia as part of the country’s US$1.1 million Artificial Intelligence Mission program, The Economic Times reported, citing sources familiar with the matter.
Should it push through, the program aims to offer the Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) at subsidized prices to startups, researchers, and academic institutions. Talks are at a “very early stage,” however, with the deal’s particulars likely finalized after upcoming elections.
The Indian government is taking a proactive stance to aid stakeholders in the country to get their hands on the coveted GPUs of the US manufacturer. A chip could cost as much as US$40,000, however, presenting a challenge to companies.
As such, the Indian government is reportedly considering two ways to deliver AI infrastructure to stakeholders, with the first being a “rent-and-sublet” program. Here, the government will buy the GPUs directly from Nvidia, after which startups and organizations can acquire the chips on a concession basis.
The alternative is a marketplace approach, where Indian businesses will be encouraged to make deals directly with Nvidia. After that, the government will provide incentives based on their “credible results.”
These reported talks come a month after the Indian government announced the AI mission, which aims to procure 10,000 GPUs for businesses in the country. In the meantime, some companies have already announced the procurement of Nvidia chips, including Yotta Data Services as well as conglomerates like Reliance Group and Tata Group.

Hello reader,
Could you get anywhere without the map on your phone these days?
I know I couldn’t navigate the labyrinthine streets of Hanoi without Google Maps and yet somehow when I first moved here, I managed it. Maybe I was just more content getting lost in my early 20s.
After all, you need to know where you’re going to move anywhere with purpose, and maps sure help with that.
Malaysia Venture Capital Management (Mavcap) recently unveiled a roadmap it hopes will move the country’s startup scene into the future. It’s an ambitious plan and one Malaysia seems in need of, given the country’s complex smorgasbord of government agencies involved with startups.
Today we look at:


Where will Malaysia’s VC roadmap take the startup space? 
Tesla laying off 10% of its global workforce
Other newsy highlights such as South Korean AI startup Upstage scoring US$72 million in funding and Apple planning more investments in Vietnam.

Malaysia’s map to startup heaven?

Malaysia has a new plan to take its startup ecosystem forward.
Mavcap, the largest government-owned VC firm in the country, has launched a roadmap with 11 “interventions” for the startup space to take place over the next six years.


High-level goals: The Malaysia Venture Capital Roadmap includes a target to double the total VC funding value by 2030. The figure in 2022 was US$758 million across 165 deals, per the roadmap. Seeding new VCs and launching a centralized platform for VCs are also part of the plan.

Steps forward: The roadmap’s goals include solving well-known problems in Malaysia’s startup ecosystem. Among the interventions mentioned is seeding younger fund managers, as institutional investors or government-owned agencies tend to stay away from younger folks when it’s time to execute investments.

Causes for concern: However, there are reasonable questions to be asked about Mavcap’s credentials. The firm was at one time the country’s premier VC, yet it has never raised a VC class nor invested in startups. In addition, it now reports to sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional, rather than directly to the government as it did in the past. How seriously the roadmap is taken will largely be down to the whims of Khazanah.

News spotlight
Tesla in layoff drive

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Tesla has laid off more than 10% of its employees worldwide.
The move comes amid increasingly stiff competition in the electric vehicle industry, as well as falling sales.


Swinging the axe: In a statement, Tesla co-founder and CEO Elon Musk said the company’s growth had led to “duplication of roles and job functions in certain areas.” He added that it was important for the company to look for ways to reduce costs and increase productivity.

Sales dip: CNN reported that Tesla produced 433,000 vehicles in the first quarter of 2024, but only delivered 387,000 in the period. In contrast, the company delivered 484,507 cars in the last three months of 2023.

Gearing up: Tesla still has ambitious expansion goals, particularly in Asian markets. The firm has offices in China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, and is reportedly considering building a multibillion-dollar EV plant in India.

Baidu‘s large language model (LLM), Ernie Bot, has reached over 200 million users and 85,000 corporate clients, just 13 months after the bot’s launch. The Chinese giant’s CEO, Robin Li, shared these details at the Baidu AI conference in Shenzhen, the South China Morning Post reported.
The company introduced Ernie, which stands for Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration, as a rival to OpenAI’s ChatGPT in March 2023. By October, it had introduced an updated version, which Li said at that time was already comparable to ChatGPT-4, OpenAI’s most recent iteration of its LLM.
As ChatGPT is unavailable in mainland China, local tech giants are racing to take its place in a market set to reach US$23.9 billion by 2027, according to Statista. As SCMP reported, over 200 other LLMs are competing in the country.
Still, Baidu is betting big it could take a significant slice of the pie. At the conference, Li revealed three new Ernie-based tools to help developers create applications and models, some of which don’t require coding.
“[The] LLM itself doesn’t create value directly, and only AI apps developed [using LLMs] can meet the real market demand,” Li said.
These tools are set to increase Ernie’s revenue contribution to the Chinese tech giant. During Baidu’s earnings call in February, Li reported that Ernie accounted for about 7.8% ofBaidu’s total cloud service’s revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023, which translates to around US$90.6 million.
Last month, Apple was also reported to be in early-stage talks with Baidu on possibly incorporating the latter’s genAI tech into the former’s products in China.

After its acquisition by Sensor Tower in March, Data.ai – previously App Annie – has undergone layoffs.
An online spreadsheet highlighting those affected shows that at least 44 people – or 11% of Data.ai’s total workforce as of last month – were laid off. However, the document does not claim to be an exhaustive list.
Tech in Asia has reached out to Sensor Tower for comments.
According to a LinkedIn post by a former employee, those affected include workers specializing in areas like product management, sales, and marketing, as well as data engineering, analytics, and science. Most of the names on the spreadsheet are from the US and Canada, but some were from Asian countries like India, China, Japan, and Singapore.
Sensor Tower acquired its rival analytics firm Data.ai last month for an undisclosed amount. As part of the announcement, Sensor Tower did say that it will “absorb part of Data.ai’s 400-person team and as such has announced a workforce reduction,” though it did not specify details.
The company had said the acquisition would bolster its mobile marketing and app intelligence products and help it penetrate more global markets – notably those in the Asia-Pacific region. Data.ai has an established presence in this market already, having set up a new Singapore base in 2015.

India-based Arya.ag has been in the black since 2013. Now, the agritech financing company says it saw significant growth in the 2023-2024 fiscal year.
Gross revenue increased 106% from last year to hit 41.5 billion rupees (US$495.9 million). Meanwhile, net revenues rose by 20% to US$43 million.
Arya.ag’s pre-tax profits also reached US$2 million, a 36% year-on-year jump.
“This translates to a net margin of 4.7%, factoring in all expenses, including interest, taxes, and depreciation, providing a comprehensive view of our financial performance,” the company said in a statement.
Arya.ag helps Indian farmers access loans, which are often hard to come by in areas like South and Southeast Asia. Instead of borrowing from local lenders at steep rates, farmers can store their produce with Arya.ag and borrow money against those goods.
The company also helps farmers sell yields when prices go up. Arya.ag became profitable after it was acquired in 2013 by Prasanna Rao and Anand Chandra, both of whom come from the agribanking division of India’s ICICI Bank.
Arya.ag boosted its take rate by 10% last year to reach 3.5%. The company also saw success with capital-efficient models like co-lending.
Moving forward, Arya.ag plans to broaden its reach, focusing on climate-sensitive regions.
Future strategies include strengthening tech-driven connections between farmers and markets, expanding satellite tracking services, and providing farmers with decision-making tools. Arya.ag will also continue investing in blockchain and AI solutions.

You could be forgiven for thinking that 2023 was a tough year for China-based tech major ByteDance. After all, the firm’s short-video app TikTok found itself in regulatory trouble around the world, from the US to Indonesia.
Yet despite these hurdles, ByteDance overtook rival Tencent in annual revenue for the first time last year.
The Financial Times reported that ByteDance’s revenue hit US$120 billion in 2023, eclipsing the US$85 billion generated by Tencent. ByteDance is a privately held company, while Tencent is traded on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
As the chart above shows, ByteDance’s revenue has swelled considerably in recent years amid TikTok’s rise as one of the world’s biggest social media apps. In contrast, Tencent’s revenue dipped slightly from a six-year high of US$86.6 billion in 2021.
Positive figures aside, the future for ByteDance remains uncertain. While it completed a merger with local ecommerce player Tokopedia to keep TikTok Shop operating in Indonesia, the app still faces a possible ban in the US.

Apple has announced that it is planning to launch an Apple Developer Academy in Bali, Indonesia. This would be the iPhone maker’s fourth academy in the country, following those in Jakarta, Surabaya, and Batam.
The Bali academy’s launch comes amid Apple boss Tim Cook’s visit to Indonesia. Cook arrived last night, according to his X account, and has gone to Indonesia’s Presidential Palace this morning to meet with President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo.
Budi Arie Setiadi, the country’s minister of communication and information, said in a press statement that the meeting discussed “Apple’s strategic plans for Indonesia and how Indonesia can be part of the global supply chain.” Previously, Setiadi said Apple will be exploring potential investments in the country, which may include a local factory – something Jokowi reiterated at the meeting.
The US-based firm has not provided any details beyond the academy launch. In response to press questions, Cook said that Jokowi’s request to open a local factory “is something we will examine.”
The Apple Developer Academy’s nine-month program teaches basic coding, design, marketing, and project management. It is open to applicants worldwide, irrespective of their education or coding knowledge.
The company said 90% of graduates have found jobs in sectors like education, ecommerce, transportation, and sustainability, with some founding startups of their own. In Indonesia alone, over 2,000 developers have graduated since the country’s first academy launched in 2018.
Apple is keeping a close eye on Southeast Asia amid challenges in China. Last month, it opened Southeast Asia’s first Apple Developer Center in Singapore.
Before flying into Indonesia, Cook visited Vietnam. During the visit, Apple announced it would increase its investment in Vietnam-based electronics suppliers, in line with the company’s shift in focus to emerging markets.

She likes playing puzzle games, enjoys discovering interesting new lifestyle brands online, and runs a YouTube channel where she does coding tutorials and livestreams.
Just like you and me, she has many different user accounts across the internet services she uses – social media, online shopping, food delivery, ride-hailing, video streaming, gaming… the list goes on.

Meet Sarah / Image generated with Midjourney

Each account represents one fragment of her “identity” online, and she has to remember the right username and password combinations in order to log in and manage these different identities. It’s also how a business trusts that the person signing in is her, and not someone else.
However, this traditional means of identity management isn’t the best.
“The digital world is trying to acquire trust in transactions through the exchange and validation of passwords,” says Priyanka Sharma, solution architect lead at Affinidi, a technology firm offering data and identity management solutions.
“Where passwords are insufficient, multifactor authentication has come up as a solution, but it’s just using additional factors like something you have, such as a trusted device. We are inherently missing the magic of ‘identifying’ someone in order to trust them digitally.”
This extends beyond logging in. Establishing trust online is hard in general – how does Sarah know that someone online is really the data scientist at a particular company that they claim to be?
But it doesn’t have to be this way. A new concept called holistic identity management aims to change how people manage their identities. Users can collect their fragmented online identities and credentials and securely store them in a “vault,” which they can share across different systems and platforms.
How would this play out in a day in Sarah’s life? Let’s have a look.
The life of Sarah
During Sarah’s time as a developer for Company X, she gained certifications in various programming languages. She also won Developer of the Year for leading a novel software project and has several patents under her belt.
After several years in the workforce, she wants to apply for a scholarship to pursue a master’s degree. Instead of cobbling together the disparate certificates and awards she’s gotten over the years, she can simply share her tamper-evident online portfolio – where her credentials have been stored – with the university to show her skills and why she’s deserving of a scholarship.
“When you collect these credentials, you may not know yet where or how you will use them, but you can store them safely and have it ready for use when needed,” explains Giriraj Daga, director of solutions architecture at Affinidi.

“With holistic identity management, you can have credentials issued from diverse authoritative and verified sources that describe something about you. You can pick out these different credentials, in the same way you pick out clothes from your closet, and put them together to achieve a particular goal while only sharing what you want to share.”
This concept also applies to shopping for groceries. Let’s say Sarah wants to try out a new online store that specializes in cruelty-free cleaning products – if she wants personalized recommendations, she has to fill in questionnaires about her shopping and cleaning habits, which would be tedious and even intrusive.
However, with holistic identity management, consent-based sharing is possible. Sarah can choose to share specific elements of her identity, such as what cleaning products she’s purchased online in the last 12 months, enabling the store to make recommendations immediately.
This “portability” of Sarah’s online behavior enriches her experience, as she can get the personalization she wants without exposing herself to unnecessary sales pitches or feeling like she has to divulge too much information. This method ensures that she is engaged by the company in a relevant way.
The benefits of holistic identity management get pushed even further when Sarah’s professional and personal lives come together.
When a developer platform asks for help to tackle a problem with an app it’s building, she can provide suggestions and prove her expertise by agreeing to share some aspects of her identity – like her YouTube channel and her employment status at Company X. This adds credibility to her responses and elevates her as an influencer within the developer community.
She can even add feedback from the developer platform to her professional portfolio, enhancing her reputation with bite-sized credentials. This way, her holistic skills are displayed and her position as a subject matter expert is established, making her the prime candidate for a new internal training program that Company X is rolling out and creating a kind of virtuous cycle with her identity.

“In holistic identity management, you can have different personas based on the different information that you have – your professional persona, financial persona, gaming persona, etc.,” says Daga. “Your identity is contextual, but it is all still a part of you, and you should be able to bring it with you and use it as needed.
Identity is “multiple aspects about yourself that you bring together for a transaction,” he says. For example, one’s personal reputation or professional credentials and membership in an organization could allow access to a client’s infrastructure.
In his view, holistic identity management would bridge the gap between the physical and digital world, providing seamless contextual experiences. Imagine if Sarah could walk into a pet store, and then scan a QR code and agree to share some information about herself with the shop, like the fact that she has a pet dog with arthritis and that it prefers beef-based treats, without needing to share her contact information. She could then be offered recommendations that meet her dog’s needs, resulting in a positive offline experience.

“Consumers will have more flexibility to engage with brands and express their intents, and they can seamlessly transition from physical to digital world and vice versa. That way, there will be more trusted relationships in this digital-powered ecosystem,” Daga adds.
Putting the pieces together
A world where our digital identities are all unified in one place and can be accessed freely and shared the way we want to may seem like a distant dream. But companies like Affinidi are working to make it a reality.
“We’re building a suite of products for customers to easily collect, store, and share data about themselves and for businesses to easily request this data,” explains Daga. “It’s contextual data sharing – also known as zero-party data – for all transactions, reimagining both physical and digital customer experiences.”

Known as the Affinidi Trust Network, this suite comprises solutions laying the foundations for holistic identity management. These include services such as the Affinidi Vault; which allows users to discover, store, collect, share, and even monetize their data; Affinidi Login, which enables passwordless authentication; and Affinidi Concierge, a private AI personal assistant that helps users optimize how they use their stored data.
Using technology such as zero-knowledge proofs, the network also has systems in place to ensure the data shared is accurate and gives individuals the means to provide consent for data sharing while verifying the identities of all parties involved.
To a better future
Holistic identity management certainly seems ideal for users like Sarah, but actually implementing the concept can be daunting for businesses. Daga recommends that they start with something simple, such as enabling passwordless logins.
“Passwordless is resonating a lot with consumers and businesses, and it’s better than passwords – it is one more choice given to users without adding too much cognitive load,” he shares. “It also improves user experience and reduces onboarding friction.”
It’s still early days for holistic identity management, but Daga and Sharma are both positive on the benefits that it can bring to companies and customers alike.
“Users can consent to share their identity with service providers in lieu of better services; and monetize their personal data in a data-driven digital economy,” says Sharma
“Businesses can harness this consent-based personal data to create hyper-personalized experiences in order to stand out in a crowded marketplace, while being on the right side of data protection laws. Holistic identity enables personalization in a way that makes things better for all parties involved.”
Sounds like a win for Sarah, and for the rest of us.

CNV, a Vietnamese cloud-based business and marketing solutions provider, has secured US$1 million in seed funding from US- and Singapore-headquartered VC firm Wavemaker Partners.
Last week, CNV said its latest funding comes after the company’s “stellar performance” in 2022 and 2023.
The company particularly highlighted 2023 as an important milestone in its development for the launch of its Zalo mini apps – which created an app-in-app experience that enabled businesses to acquire users at lower costs and engage them in a “deeper and more seamless manner.”
CNV counts multinational corporations, SMEs, and government agencies among its 20,000 customers.
Founded by Nguyen Tuan Phu and Do Dang Khoa in 2020, CNV offers digital transformation software-as-a-service (SaaS) products and marketing services targeting MSMEs and enterprises in Vietnam.
It aims to help these entities optimize their client-facing and back-end customer data platform analysis activities, and also “achieve sustainable growth” via marketing, loyalty, and ecommerce activities.
CNV’s tools include gamification, automation marketing, and customer data platforms (CDPs).
Since its founding, the company has reported 250% growth in revenue and customers acquired, with US$30 million in annual gross merchandise value over 94,000 orders.
CNV chief executive Phu Nguyen said the company’s goal this year, with the funding from Wavemaker, is to become a “no-code sales and customer care platform.”
“Wavemaker Partners is proud to support CNV in its next phase of growth to help hundreds of thousands of businesses in Vietnam drive meaningful results with their sales and customer engagement using CNV’s comprehensive CDP and loyalty SaaS products,” added Phuong Tran, principal at Wavemaker Partners.

The fate of Bake, a crypto exchange that once claimed to manage US$1 billion in assets, now rests in the hands of a Singapore judicial commissioner who will determine whether its parent firm, Cake Group, should be liquidated.
On April 12, Judicial Commissioner Alex Wong of Singapore’s High Court heard arguments on whether to grant the winding-up application filed by U-Zyn Chua, a co-founder and director of Cake Group. Chua was also Bake’s former chief technology officer.

Bake was previously known as Cake DeFi before the company rebranded in June 2023.
If Wong grants Chua’s application, it would be a stunning end to a crypto firm that saw US$631 million in revenue in 2021.
Complicating matters is the escalating conflict between Cake Group’s co-founders that has led to investigations by the police and the Ministry of Manpower into the company, though neither agency has announced their findings.
Because of this and Cake Group’s seeming resistance to the crypto winter, Chua’s request  for liquidation caught the crypto community by surprise. While the company did lay off approximately 30% of its staff in November 2023, there are no claims of insolvency and no accounts have been frozen for lack of funds – common signs that a crypto exchange is facing financial distress.
In its 2022 financial statement, Cake Group claimed to have finished the year with US$36.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, US$47 million in stablecoins, and US$70.6 million in digital assets.
Why liquidate?
So why is Chua seeking to wind up the company? Wong asked him that question several times during the April 12 hearing.
While Chua’s lawyers gave several answers, the main reason seems to be a rift between Chua and Julian Hosp, one of Cake Group’s co-founders and its current CEO. Hosp was also the firm’s only other director until Benjamin Zumbrunn’s appointment in January.

Details surrounding the co-founders’ falling out emerged at last week’s hearing. Chua and Hosp began to fight in October 2023 about upcoming layoffs at Cake Group. According to insiders, Chua was unhappy about the number of cuts being made in the engineering section and his exclusion from the selection process.
In a message Hosp sent to senior management at the time and later seen by Tech in Asia, Chua was told that retrenchment was the prerogative of the CEO and not subject to board approval.
“Julian and I could not work together,” Chua tells Tech in Asia. “We discussed a separation – either him or I were to leave – which ended up with him agreeing to buy out my shares at S$32.5 million.”
Chua says he was happy with the agreement, but Hosp retracted the offer the next day via WhatApp.
“Sorry u-zyn, i can’t go through the buyout. I always saw you as my partner. Lets give this 6 months, til the end of Q1 and sell for a way higher price,” the CEO said in his message, which was seen by Tech in Asia.
Hosp proceeded with the job cuts after that, and Chua says he was shut out of the decision-making process. The layoffs were announced on November 14, 2023, and Chua filed his application to wind up Cake Group the following month on December 1.
In a February hearing, Hosp voiced his willingness to sell his shares to Chua. The court gave the parties five weeks to reach a deal. But despite several offers, no deal was made.
Both sides gave the judge a list of reasons why the other was to blame.
Hosp’s lawyers accused Chua of using delaying tactics to drive the price down. Chua tells Tech in Asia there was a deal-breaker: a clause that would give Hosp immunity from any civil actions related to his actions as CEO.
Credit cards and a nanny
Chua alleges that Hosp used the company credit card for personal expenses and hired a nanny using company funds. Chua says he has filed a police report on this matter, and investigations are underway.
Additional documents seen by Tech in Asia also show that Hosp was claiming millions in expenses each month. While much of this was legitimate business expenses, Hosp was also using the cards to purchase services for his own side projects, according to a Cake Group insider.

Bake’s monthly invoices from Meta, which were also seen by Tech in Asia, show that many of the ads bought by Hosp were not for the crypto exchange or its campaigns. Instead, those purchases included campaigns for a newsletter and websites such as JulianHosp.com and Nas Academy.
Hosp used these platforms to promote his private lectures and courses, which were often aimed at instructing people on how to invest in crypto.
At the April 12 hearing, Hosp’s lawyers denied that the promotions were for his personal use. Instead, they were for a “top of the funnel” marketing strategy in which Hosp sought to first build trust among customers before eventually funneling them back to Cake Group and conversions.
Hosp’s lawyers also acknowledged the police investigation at the hearing but noted that no charges have been filed.
The CEO was also investigated by Singapore’s Ministry of Manpower for the hiring of Nicola Muldoon, who joined Cake Group as a “manager editor” on April 28, 2023 for a monthly salary of S$8,400. But documents revealed Muldoon was actually a nanny working for Hosp.
Chua says he first asked the team about who Muldoon was on October 7, 2023. For reasons that are unclear, Muldoon’s S Pass was canceled three days later on October 10, according to ministry documents seen by Tech in Asia. We reached out to Muldoon but got no response.
Other documents seen by Tech in Asia indicated that Hosp repaid the S$40,000 that Cake Group paid Muldoon on October 10.
Tech in Asia sent Hosp and his lawyers questions about these allegations. The CEO did not respond, but he did post a comment online.
“I have already spoken to the police and various government agencies about this,” Hosp said on X (formerly Twitter). “I understand making false statements is an offence in itself. So, let’s see what eventually comes out of this.”
In a separate post, Hosp dismissed internet rumors that he had left Singapore to avoid criminal charges.
“Who ever told you am I leaving [sic] Singapore lied to you,” he wrote. “I am here. I stay here. I live here.”
Just sell off your shares?
When Judicial Commissioner Wong asked Chua why he did not sell his shares to a third party, he responded that he could not find a buyer.
Chua blamed this on a number of issues, but he says the main problem is Hosp’s reputation.
Hosp first came to prominence as the president and co-founder of TenX, a Singapore-based crypto wallet. Established in 2015 with Toby Hoenisch, TenX attempted to create a blockchain-based credit card.

Chua also worked at TenX during this time, although he says that he and Hosp did not know each other well.
Hosp stepped down from TenX in January 2019 after a video of his involvement with Lyoness, an Austrian discount shopping service that was declared an illegal pyramid scheme, came to light.
A few months after Hosp’s departure, payments giant Visa ordered TenX to take its credit card off the network. Others including Hosp have accused Hoenisch of running off with the remainder of the TenX’s funds, estimated at US$80 million.
In 2023, Hoenisch was also identified by Forbes journalist Laura Shin as the perpetrator of the 2016 Ethereum hack that drained 3.6 million ether from Dao, a crypto venture capital fund.
Hosp has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, but Chua, despite notifying existing Cake Group shareholders of his desire to sell his stake and waiting 30 days, did not get any offers.
Left with no way to exit, Chua filed the application to wind up Cake Group.
Apparently trapped together, Chua and Hosp must wait to see what Judicial Commissioner Wong decides. If he grants the application, Cake Group would simply be wound up; but if Wong denies it, his decision will likely set off a new round of lawsuits.

Hello reader,
Crusaders FC, the soccer team I support back home in Northern Ireland, has gone through a few jersey rebrands in recent years.
Rather than ripping up every part of the club’s identity and starting anew, these “rebrands” typically keep the existing colors and just redesign the shirt somewhat. Because, after all, why throw out what has worked for you over the years just for something new and shiny?
The Asia unit of GGV Capital recently rebranded as Granite Asia, but as today’s featured story details, that doesn’t mean it’s all change at the firm.
Senior managing partners Jenny Lee and Foo Jixun are still at the helm and plan to use their years of experience as the firm tweaks what it does, rather than change completely.
Today we look at:

Granite Asia’s rebrand in focus
Carro sets its sights on a US$100 million pre-IPO fundraise
Other newsy highlights such as Zomato earning rave reviews from stock analysts and TikTok reporting big gains in Vietnam.

Reshaping Granite Asia

Image credit: Timmy Loen

The Asia unit of GGV Capital recently rebranded as Granite Asia and will put the Asia-Pacific region as its focus.
Senior managing partners Jenny Lee and Foo Jixun were part of the founding team at GGV Capital, and they’re bringing that vast experience to new asset classes and ideas.


Diversification: Granite Asia will move beyond providing venture capital to funding and supporting founders and their ideas. It’s also planning to launch a credit product to complement its existing equity financing option.

Connect the dots: While GGV Capital covered Southeast Asia, China, and India, Granite Asia will shift its focus to Asia Pacific. Lee and Foo told The Business Times that they feel they have an edge in operating in this region. “It’s even more important to have investors and board members who can help connect the dots on a global basis,” Lee said.

Better together: Granite Asia’s existing pool of global investors have remained limited partners following the rebranding. Lee plans on keeping communications with these investors open as the firm does its work.

News spotlight
Carro eyes funding drive to get in IPO gear

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Singapore-based Carro is planning to raise US$100 million ahead of going public.
CEO Aaron Tan told Bloomberg that the fundraise could bring the used-car marketplace’s valuation to more than US$1.5 billion.


Planning ahead: Tan told Tech in Asia that Carro plans to raise the funds over the next six months. The capital is earmarked for market expansion, including M&amp;A deals in Hong Kong and Japan.

Work to be done: Yinglan Tan, founding managing partner at early Carro investor Insignia Ventures Partners, told Bloomberg that it is “important that Carro wins a few more markets in Asia Pacific” ahead of its market debut.

Race to IPO: Carro’s rival Carsome has also been making moves ahead of a potential IPO. The Malaysia-based firm recently reorganized its leadership team by bringing in Eric Chan, a former senior executive of Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage, as group president and COO.

Primer co-founder and CEO Gabriel Le Roux / Photo credit: Primer

Payments firm Primer said it is on track to generate a 200% rise in annual revenue for 2024.
This comes as global enterprise merchants acknowledge the pivotal role of payments in shaping new commerce experiences, reducing costs, and boosting growth, according to the UK-based company.
With this, Primer is also expecting a 280% growth in transactions for 2024.
In Asia Pacific, it anticipates a 280% year-on-year revenue increase, supported by an investment from Tencent and partnerships with local companies such as Zenyum, One Championship, and Tazapay.
At the time of Tencent’s investment, Primer said it plans to widen its footprint further in Asia Pacific, with a focus on China, Singapore, and Australia.
Asia Pacific is poised to be the top fintech market globally by 2030, propped up by local industry giants like Ant Group, PhonePe, and Grab. China currently generates the largest share of fintech revenue in the region, which is expected to continue moving forward.
In Europe, Primer’s revenue is forecasted to grow 400% between 2023 and 2024, partly due to alliances with industry players like GetYourGuide, Conforama, and Maisons du Monde.
Launched in 2020 by former PayPal executives Gabriel Le Roux and Paul Anthony, Primer operates in over 35 countries. It enables companies to offer multiple payments and commerce services through a single platform.
The firm has raised US$94 million so far from investors like Accel, Iconiq, and RTP Global.

Hello,
I first watched Jobs when I was in 10th grade. The movie made me want to become an entrepreneur so bad that I even started scribbling down some ideas on paper. However, these were soon lost when examinations came around and trigonometry took priority.
But one thing I can’t forget about the movie is the office drama. The conflict of ideas between Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak was such an eye-opener.
Later on, I found out that Jobs lied to Wozniak, took credit for his work, and even cheated him out of some payouts.
And that’s the harsh truth: Businesses with more than one founder will have conflicts. Two brains simply can’t drive the chariot in the same direction smoothly.
Perhaps this is what drove U-Zyn Chua, co-founder and former CTO of Cake Group and Bake.io, to file an application to wind up the business.
In this week’s big story, my colleague Scott writes about why Chua has requested a Singapore court to liquidate the firm. The top reason was a falling out between him and Julian Hosp, co-founder and CEO of the company.
One of Chua’s allegations includes Hosp using company funds to promote his own side business and to hire a nanny.
In this week’s second big story, my colleague Elyssa dives deep into family offices in Southeast Asia and how they invest their funds.
Notably, 75% of conglomerates in the region are owned by family offices, so these entities have invested in many successful startups and VC firms.
Finally, in AI Odyssey, I discuss whether 2024 has become the year of the AI chip.

AI ODYSSEY
Promising AI projects we’re noticing
Is your ChatGPT slow? Blame the chip shortage
When I started writing about tech in 2022, one of my colleagues was deeply involved in covering semiconductors.
I thought it was super cool to write about new AI advancements, as relatively few of us were doing so at that time. He, on the other hand, claimed that his beat would be critical in the upcoming years, and he was right.
As we enter the second quarter of 2024, the tech world is shifting its focus from the excitement of developing AI applications to the important work on advancing semiconductors.
The need for that is clear.
For instance, a few weeks back I purchased a subscription for ChatGPT 4. I was really excited until I realized how slow it was. For a service that costs more than US$20 a month, I expect a faster response. Currently, ChatGPT 4 takes anywhere around two to four minutes to produce a text article.
To be fair, OpenAI probably wasn’t expecting so many converts when it released ChatGPT 4 to the masses. The rapid growth has left the company facing a shortage of chips, resulting in slow processing times.
But OpenAI knew this was going to be an issue. Last year, in its annual report, Microsoft highlighted the availability of graphics processing units (GPUs) as a possible risk factor for investors.
Even Sam Altman, founder and CEO of OpenAI, had to say at one point, “We’re so short on GPUs, the fewer people that use the tool, the better.”
Maybe that’s why Altman himself is considering the possibility of OpenAI producing chips in-house. And he’s not the only one doing so; Google and Meta are also building their own AI chips.

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Google has developed the Axion AI chip specifically for handling the massive data demands of large language models (LLMs). It can be clustered for even greater performance.
Meanwhile, Meta’s new AI chip is focused on improving its Facebook and Instagram content recommendation systems.
Notably, Intel launched the Gaudi 3 accelerator, which the company claims has more AI computing power, networking bandwidth, and memory bandwidth to scale up AI training and inference on the LLMs that power AI chatbots like ChatGPT.
Even Nvidia launched its new GPU and platform earlier this year. The GPU reduces costs and energy consumption by up to 25x compared to its predecessor.
It’s understandable why companies want to foray into chip design and manufacturing. Competition is intense, and companies can’t rely on existing hardware to deliver new offerings – such as power-hungry text-to-video apps like Sora – to the masses.
While chip development might be exciting, the industry is also beginning to cause new problems that have wide-reaching implications.
For instance, citizens of Goodyear, a city in Arizona in the US, are facing a water shortage. This is not because of climate change but because Microsoft and OpenAI are using the town’s water supply to feed their data center.
The three-building campus is projected to use 212 million liters of water annually, an amount comparable to the yearly water consumption of nearly 700 local households.
That means for countries like India, which faces water shortages almost every year, focusing on chip manufacturing might pose additional challenges.

Carousell office / Source: Carousell

Laku6, an Indonesian electronics recommerce firm acquired by Carousell in 2022, laid off around 17% of its workforce in January 2024 for “long-term success and sustainability,” a company spokesperson told Tech in Asia.
The Laku6 spokesperson said that the decision was made after evaluating the evolving industry trends and growth trajectory of the company. This review had led the company to “reallocate resources strategically.”
Affected staff will be provided compensation per government regulation, as well as relevant employment assistance, the person added.
In July 2022, Carousell invested US$25 million as part of a deal to acquire Laku6. The deal was also supported by the former’s investor, Heliconia Capital Management, a unit of Temasek Holdings.
The acquisition was Carousell’s effort to further expand its coverage in the market for pre-owned phones and electronics. At the time of the acquisition, Laku6 said it had processed transactions of more than half a million mobile phones and served over 16,000 mobile phone merchants.
With the layoffs, Laku6 joins the growing list of Indonesian companies that have reduced their headcounts recently amid harsh macroeconomic conditions. This includes startups like Waresix, Xendit, and Pitik, which all cut their workforce earlier in 2024.
Carousell itself laid off 10% of its staff in December 2022, as it aimed for profitability. According to its financial report for 2022, the company’s pre-tax losses widened by 4% year over year as its total expenses were up 57% compared to the previous year.
This year, Carousell made another strategic move with the acquisition of LuxLexicon, a Singapore-based reseller of luxury bags. This took place nearly two months after co-founder Lucas Ngoo stepped down from managing day-to-day operations at the company.

Tesla has laid off over 10% of its global workforce amid falling sales and growing competition in the electric vehicle industry.
Elon Musk, co-founder and CEO of Tesla, said in a statement that the rapid global growth of the company has led to “duplication of roles and job functions in certain areas.”
Rohan Patel, vice president for public policy and business development, and Drew Baglino, senior vice president for powertrain and energy engineering, have also left the company. Baglino had worked with Tesla since 2006, while Patel joined the firm in 2016.
In the first quarter of 2024, Tesla’s annual sales declined for the first time since 2020, the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic. The company was reported to have produced 433,000 vehicles, but only delivered 387,000 in the quarter, as reported by CNN. This figure marks a decline from the 484,507 cars delivered in the last three months of 2023.
“As we prepare the company for our next phase of growth, it is extremely important to look at every aspect of the company for cost reductions and increasing productivity,” Musk added in his statement.
Tesla’s shares fell 5.6% to close at US$161.48 on Monday. Shares of other EV companies like Rivian Automotive, Lucid Group, and VinFast Auto also dropped between 2.4% and 9.4%.
Despite this, Tesla is keen on expanding its global presence, notably in Asian markets. According to data from Statista, Asia Pacific in particular has been logging higher growth in EV sales compared to Western regions.
In the region, Tesla has offices in China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.
Earlier this month, it was reported that Musk is exploring potential locations for a multibillion-dollar EV plant in India. The development came after the country lowered import tariffs on EVs.

Despite the decline in overall funding for startups in Asia over the past year, AI has become an outlier and continues to attract investor attention.
Several AI companies in the region have recently announced new funding, including South Korea-based Upstage.
The firm has secured 100 billion won (around US$72 million) in a series B funding round from investors such as SK Networks, KT Corp, Korea Development Bank, and Shinhan Venture Investment, Bloomberg reported.
The fresh raise is almost triple that of the company’s previous round in 2021, where it secured US$27 million in investments from SBVA – then known as SoftBank Ventures Asia – and Company K Partners. SBVA also participated in the new funding round.
Upstage was co-founded in 2020 by Kim Seong-Hoon, previously the head of AI at Korean internet giant Naver Corp, along with Lee Hal-Seok and Park Eun-Jung.
The company offers document processing engines and a large language model called Solar, which can be molded to serve several use cases in ecommerce, legal, healthcare, and other industries.
With the new funds, the company aims to expand its business to Japan, Southeast Asia, and the US.
This month, several AI companies in Asia have announced new funding, including Singapore-based Staple, Mindverse, and Ailytics. Meanwhile, OpenAI also established its first Asia office in Tokyo.

The country has stepped into the limelight, and some investors are calling it the third major startup market in Southeast Asia after Singapore and Indonesia. It’s also home to several startups that have made their mark on the global stage, such as electric vehicle maker VinFast, which listed on the Nasdaq in 2023, as well as blockchain gaming startup Sky Mavis, the firm behind the game Axie Infinity.
At Tech in Asia’s upcoming Saigon Summit, we’re gathering some of Asia’s leading investors to share their perspectives on Vietnam’s tech potential.
Vertex Ventures Southeast Asia and India (VVSEAI) is one example. Having backed companies such as Grab, Nium, and Patsnap, the firm recently closed its fifth fund at US$541 million.

Now, Vietnam is on its radar.
Ahead of the summit, Tuyet Vu, advisor at VVSEAI, shares her thoughts on the country’s tech opportunity.
The following interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.
What do you do at Vertex Ventures?
I’m an advisor at VVSEAI. We are excited about the tremendous growth opportunity in Vietnam and are looking to back founders building businesses that have the potential to become regional or global champions.
My role entails sourcing for ambitious and motivated founders in this market and helping them succeed after investment. We already have one Vietnamese portfolio company, Metub, in the content creator space.
Why are you excited about Vietnam’s tech and startup ecosystem?
First, Vietnam is among the few countries hitting more than 5% year-on-year growth in the past year, and this growth is expected to continue in the foreseeable future. It is a sizable market – Vietnam is a country with a population of nearly 100 million, with rising income levels and an expanding middle class with multiple unmet needs. This presents an exciting opportunity for potential startups.
Second, we are excited about the young, tech-savvy, digital-first Vietnamese millennials and Gen Z. They are in their prime earning years or about to enter the workforce. This provides a solid foundation for technological innovation and adoption.

Finally, we believe in the growing pool of Vietnamese skilled talent, particularly in fields such as software development, engineering, and design. We like the optimism and hunger that we see in the young generation of builders. They are fast learners who constantly stay on top of the latest tech trends and business models in the world. They are also very forward looking and ambitious. We are hopeful to find the next unicorn builders in this market and we look forward to building great companies with them.
What are the biggest challenges facing Vietnam’s startups?
First is the operational challenge of the market. It takes street-smart entrepreneurs with the ability to deeply understand the market to navigate and thrive in a place like Vietnam.
Having a financial war chest can only go so far, but in these challenging times, it is a critical part of the solution for founders looking to scale their business. There comes the second challenge, which is the need to educate investors on the market potential of tech startups. Sometimes, this potential is not obvious, especially in a nuanced market such as ours. Therefore, it takes convincing and patient education to demonstrate this potential to investors.

To access funding, Vietnamese startup founders also need strong communication skills in English – be it verbal or written communication. While we increasingly see more founders fluent in English, there are high-potential founders with strong ability to deliver who are disadvantaged because of low English literacy levels.
Third is the access to talent. As startups scale, strong talent is in short supply in all positions – especially in mid-level roles. Vietnamese startups should seek to address this challenge to continue thriving.
What will you be speaking about at Tech in Asia’s Saigon Summit and why is it important?
I will join other speakers on a panel discussing how startups can get funded in Vietnam.
It will be an interesting topic particularly for startups in Vietnam during this time. Access to capital has been a challenge for many startups in the country thus far. It’s driven by either a lack of diversity of investors in the market or the disconnect between founders and investors. I’m eager to meet with many founders in this summit and share with them about VVSEAI’s interest and excitement for this market.
We believe in co-creating champions with outstanding founders. We’re looking forward to meeting founders and hearing from them about their vision, future plans, their priorities, their needs, and how we could be helpful for them in their journey.

Hear more from Tuyet, as well as a host of other exciting speakers, at Tech in Asia’s upcoming Saigon Summit. Held on May 30 at GEM Center, Ho Chi Minh City, we’re bringing together some of Southeast Asia’s best and brightest to chart Vietnam’s tech future together.

A look into Southeast Asia’s most successful publicly listed conglomerates will reveal that most were built not by a single founder, but with the help and support of families.
Research from EY-Parthenon shows almost 75% of conglomerates in the region are owned by families compared to just 50% globally.
As such, it’s not surprising to find that family offices have invested in Southeast Asia’s emerging and most successful startups as well as VC firms. A family office is a privately held company usually set up by ultra-wealthy families to serve as investment vehicles to deploy their money, either directly or as limited partners in a VC fund.
Sameer Narula, managing partner of private investment firm August One, tells Tech in Asia that there are two types of family offices.
He explains that multifamily offices “charge families a fee to help them invest their capital.” On the other hand, single family offices involve one family that hires “an ex-banker or a manager to help manage their capital.”

August One has worked with both, helping family offices invest their capital in companies usually based in Europe. The firm also has a Singapore-based accelerator called One Blue.
Since the end of pandemic-induced lockdowns, family offices have been diversifying their portfolios. While these entities previously focused on more traditional assets like real estate and securities, they have developed an appetite for private market investments in startups and VC funds.
A Citibank official in Singapore even said their family office clients allocate as much as 40% of their portfolio to private market investments.
A safe place
Asian family offices often look into investment opportunities that could help them achieve wealth safety.
“Unlike Western family offices that want to preserve their wealth, families from the Global South usually seek to keep their wealth safe,” Narula observes. Typically, these families have just grown their wealth “in the last 20 to 30 years, so they keep it in countries like Singapore, where the currency is stable,” he adds.

Tech in Asia’s data shows that most of the family offices that back startups in Southeast Asia are based in Singapore. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the country’s central bank, has actively courted this investor class, which grew from 400 by the end of 2020 to 1,100 by 2022. MAS also continues to provide incentives to family offices that invest in local entities.
That said, while these family offices may be set up in the city-state, their owners may not always be Singaporeans.
For example, German entrepreneur Tom Wolf established a single family office called Two Family Office. Wolf is the founder of Metawolf, a publicly listed manufacturer and ecommerce operator in Germany.
His family office has invested in a Singapore-based startup called Sindcon, which makes hardware used for Internet of Things ecosystems.
Follow the money
Like VC firms in Southeast Asia’s startup scene during the early aughts, family offices have a preference for fintech and ecommerce startups.

Most family offices do not easily jump into trends, says Rishika Chandan, managing director of consumer-focused VC firm Venturi Partners. Instead, they target startups that can attract consumers’ time and money.
Family offices also ask if their investments are “making a positive impact,” adds Chandan. Indeed, Tech in Asia data shows that several family offices have backed startups focused on climate tech, which aims to help both consumers and companies mitigate climate change.
Others also look for startups that could help them fulfill their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals.
Close to the core
Some family offices bankroll companies that are adjacent to their core businesses.
When Singapore-based Venturi Partners closed its maiden fund worth US$180 million in 2021, family offices from as far as Belgium and France came calling. “Family offices also look into investing in geographies or verticals that they are not familiar with. They come to us and ask: help us understand this market,” Chandan shares.
Tech in Asia’s data also includes VC firms that are owned or operated by a family-owned conglomerate, such as JG Digital Equity Ventures (JGDEV) of the Gokongwei family in the Philippines and Sinar Mas Digital Ventures (SMDV) of the Widjaja family in Indonesia. Both have sunk money in homegrown startups that are adjacent to their main businesses.
For instance, JGDEV has stakes in B2B marketplace GrowSari and digital bank Tyme. They are supported by the listed retail and banking units of parent firm JG Summit, respectively.
But Indonesia’s family-owned conglomerates have long made deep investments in the country’s startup ecosystem. Tech in Asia has mapped out how these corporate giants have tapped their main businesses to back promising local startups or have set up their own VC firms.

If family offices in Indonesia are contributing to the country’s and Southeast Asia’s startup ecosystems, can its peers in the region do the same?
Chandan of Venturi Partners thinks it’s possible. “It makes sense because these families understand a great deal about these markets, and once they start early [investment] positions [in startups], then naturally you can expect more external capital to flow in,” she says.
We hope that as we constantly update our database, this will be a useful reference for anyone who’s interested in Southeast Asia’s family offices, and their impact on the region’s startup ecosystem.
We acknowledge that we’re missing some data, so do reach out to elyssa@techinasia.com to help us fill in the gaps.
Here are some caveats about the data:

The family offices included were only those found in publicly available databases or reported in news reports.
The list is of family offices based in and out of Southeast Asia. As long as the family has an investment in a startup or VC fund based in Southeast Asia, it is included in the list.

ChatGPT developer OpenAI has set up its first Asia in Tokyo and named Tadao Nagasaki, the former president of Amazon Web Services Japan, as country leader.
Nagasaki was with AWS Japan for nearly 12 years and has over 30 years of work experience in tech companies including Dell.
“I believe AI technology has the potential to transform the way we live and work and improve the overall quality of life,” he wrote in a Linkedin post.
Nagasaki will oversee OpenAI’s commercial and market engagement initiatives in Japan and help build a local team.
The AI firm said it chose the country for its tech prowess, culture of service, and openness to innovation. Japan’s strategic location also places it closer to companies like Daikin, Rakuten, and Toyota Connected, which are already using its services to automate and assist in day-to-day operations.
US-based OpenAI has also launched a GPT-4 custom model optimized for the Japanese language that “operates up to 3x faster than its predecessor.”
“We believe AI will accelerate work by empowering people to be more creative and productive,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement.

Apple aims to increase its investments in Vietnam-based electronics suppliers, as the US tech giant continues to shift its focus toward emerging markets to drive growth.
The announcement came as CEO Tim Cook arrived in the Southeast Asian nation for a two-day visit.
The US tech titan has so far invested 400 trillion dong (US$15.8 billion) in the country through its local supply chain partners since 2019, it said in a statement.
Apple has been in Vietnam for over a decade, creating over 200,000 jobs in the country. In the announcement, the iPhone maker said it has also allied with local organizations to supply safe water and clean energy in rural schools in Vietnam.
“From partnering with local suppliers to supporting clean water projects and educational opportunities, we are committed to continuing to strengthen connections in Vietnam,” said Cook in a statement.
Cook’s visit is significant, as US companies have begun seeking an alternative to manufacturing in China.

Karzo, a logistics startup focused on the Mekong region, has bagged new funds from a follow up pre-series A funding round led by Orbit Startups, Cocoon Capital, and NP Consulting. The startup did not disclose the total amount raised.
The fresh capital comes as Karzo prepares for a series A funding round, which the startup had previously planned for 2021.
Karzo, which calls itself an “asset-light, mid-mile” logistics company, made headway amid the pandemic as it offered an online marketplace for truck operators and third-party logistics companies.
The platform lets truckers connect with suppliers in need of logistics and distribution services. Karzo then takes a commission for every transaction made.
It counts major FMCG and multinational firms such as Maersk Line and Chang Beer as clients.
Karzo founder and CEO Alex Wicks said the new funding will allow the company to increase its market share in the Mekong region. It currently operates in Myanmar and Thailand.
To help it capture more market share, the startup is developing KarzApp, a mobile app that offers truckers a digital platform to manage freight requests.
The app aims to partner with financial institutions like insurance firms and dealerships, which Karzo said could generate extra revenue streams for trucking companies.
The company’s asset-light strategy comes at an opportune time – Southeast Asia’s freight and logistics market is set to reach US$475 billion by 2029, according to Mordor Intelligence.

Hello reader,
There are so many beauty brands out there these days, and even more beauty products. When I was younger, I was pretty much only familiar with whatever the local drugstore stocked – names like SilkyGirl, Maybelline, and Revlon made up my early forays into makeup.
Now, with the internet at my fingertips, I can explore so many more brands and products. Whether it’s retinol from Canadian brand The Ordinary, eye cream from South Korea’s Some By Mi, or lipsticks and blushes from brands I’ve never heard of before hailing from Thailand or Indonesia, there’s so much more that’s accessible right from my smartphone screen.
Today’s premium story reflects this growth in the beauty commerce space, specifically in Indonesia. As the nation’s population becomes more affluent, its purchasing power has also increased. This creates an exciting opportunity for startups in the sector, whether they’re making the products themselves or crafting marketplaces where users can discover new and exciting brands.
Today we look at:

Premium summary
Eye of the beholder

Beauty commerce is on the rise in Indonesia. The average Indonesian consumer is projected to spend US$27.2 on cosmetics and toiletries in 2024, up from US$20.2 in 2019. Moreover, the country’s beauty and personal care segment is expected to generate US$9 billion in revenue this year.
Let’s take a closer look.


Taking the lead: In an Indonesia-focused survey conducted by research firm Jakpat, 81% of respondents said they shop for makeup products through ecommerce platforms, while 68% said they bought skincare products online. Shopee remains the favorite among consumers for such purchases, having a 63.5% ecommerce market share for the beauty and personal care segment as of February 2024.

Naming names: With the country’s beauty commerce sector on the rise, there have been many new players, including the likes of Esqa, Rose All Day, Base, Somethinc, and Nama Beauty. Many of these startups have built their own direct-to-consumer brands combining sales channels through websites and ecommerce platforms.

Funding matters: While most of these brands are not VC-backed, several have raised funding. However, investment in the sector has fallen significantly from US$100 million in 2022 to just US$5.4 million in 2023, likely due to investors being more cautious about backing startups.

The rise of generative AI means that businesses need to figure out ways to make the tech work for them and their goals. That’s where India-based AI cloud and platform-as-a-service startup Neysa, which has just raised US$20 million in a seed round, comes into the picture.


What it does: Founded in 2023, Neysa focuses on helping businesses deploy, train, and manage generative AI models. Its services aim to make AI project management efficient and secure.

Why it does it: According to founder Anindya Das, the startup was “conceived from a deep understanding of the day-to-day challenges faced in managing and scaling cloud and the transformative potential of AI.” 

What’s next: The company plans to launch its services in the third quarter of this year.

Ryde became the first Singaporean ride-hailing company to debut on the New York Stock Exchange as it sought “greater global recognition … and higher liquidity.”

The ride-hailing sector in Southeast Asia is predicted to reach a market size of US$10.5 billion by 2028.
Will these players pose a threat to Grab’s dominance? Or is the Nasdaq-listed company’s pole position safe?
The Grab grip
Launching a ride-hailing business requires dealing with a classic chicken-and-egg situation: To provide the reliability and reach that consumers expect, you need a consistent supply of drivers on your platform. However, attracting these drivers is challenging without a substantial consumer base. As a result, acquiring both sides often requires deep pockets.
This is where Grab stands out, benefiting from a period of low interest rates from 2008 to early 2022. It has secured a total of nearly US$16.5 billion in funding over the years.
The company emerged with its ride-hailing model at a time when capital was more abundant and VC firms poured investments into companies they deemed promising.
That’s not the case in today’s environment, with the “era of easy money” over.

Investors won’t shell out capital for another ride-hailing player in the same way they did for Grab “unless there is a compelling change in the way of ride-hailing, for example driverless cars,” Christopher Quek, managing partner of Trive Venture Capital – which holds a 13% stake in Tada’s parent MVLLabs – tells Tech in Asia.
Such tech shifts often present an opportunity for new players to emerge. For example, the rise of livestreaming in ecommerce provided an opening for TikTok Shop to challenge Shopee’s dominant position in Indonesia.
For its part, Grab does not appear to be sitting on its laurels. It continues to roll out new initiatives and invest in its mobility business.
The firm recently introduced a group rides feature in Singapore, enabling passengers to plan a trip together while receiving real-time updates on the status of the ride. This differs from the existing multi-stop rides feature that only allows a single user to coordinate the trip.
The company is also working on a bill-splitting tool so that users do not have to do so manually.
Even as Grab reduced incentive spending across the board – total incentives in 2023 were down by 19% compared to the previous year – it has spent more on its mobility business, the only vertical to see an increase in expenditures.

Incentives for the mobility unit, which includes those to drivers and customers, rose 29.5% year on year in 2023.
This investment in its mobility business appears to have been efficient, with year-on-year growth in GMV of 32% outpacing the rate of growth in incentives spent.
Another notable aspect of Grab’s business is its razor-sharp focus on Southeast Asia.
It has been clear in its agenda of being the leader in the region and has not sought to dilute its focus. The firm’s localization strategy has been cited as a factor that helped it beat Uber at its own game in 2018, which ultimately led the US ride-hailing giant to cease operations in Southeast Asia.
In comparison, Estonia-based Bolt is present in 45 countries globally, while Tada is actively engaged in acquisition discussions in countries like South Korea and Taiwan, according to Kay Woo, CEO and founder of MVLLabs.
New commission models
With Grab in a commanding lead, competitors are experimenting with alternate models that will provide more choices to customers and drivers, while not necessarily challenging Grab’s dominance.

High commission rates have been a bone of contention for Grab’s drivers. Protests have emerged, with drivers expressing their grievances over fare cuts and changes to incentive schemes.
In response to such concerns, companies such as Tada and Ryde are offering zero commission rates, allowing drivers to retain full payment for each completed ride. In contrast, Grab charges up to 20% commission.
But operating on a zero-commission model may not be financially viable in the long run. Companies may struggle to cover costs unless they have an alternate way of earning money.
Tada, for example, charges a fixed small platform fee, and drivers are rewarded further when they earn favorable customer reviews. Such initiatives have led to an organic acquisition of drivers with “rides growing at almost 4x in each of the last four years,” says Woo.
GSM also has a fixed salary structure along with a bonus per trip. This approach has helped the platform gain “nearly 20% of the ride-hailing market share in Vietnam” in only seven months of operations, according to Thanh Nguyen, global CEO of GSM.
While this structure brings a sense of security among drivers, it has its own downsides. Driving for GSM is not as flexible as driving for Grab, as drivers do not have the freedom to choose their schedules, according to an analysis by Le Hong Hiep, senior fellow at ISEAS, Yusof Ishak Institute.
The analysis by Hiep mentions that drivers have also expressed concerns about GSM’s rising expectations from them to generate higher revenue and the implementation of more stringent criteria for bonuses.

For its part, Grab may have found a way to address concerns over its commission rates. It has come up with a variable commission structure for Singapore that replaces its previous fixed rate. This will change from trip to trip and would be lower when drivers have to travel farther.
While this arrangement is expected to boost drivers’ willingness to accept longer trips, it may pose challenges for customers taking short rides. Grab has said it will improve the new structure based on feedback.
The EV play
Electric mobility is another area where several ride-hailing firms are lining up their fleets. Grab was one of the first players to experiment with electric vehicles in partnership with automakers in 2019.
In response to a query from Tech in Asia, the company says that in countries where it uses a rental fleet, “a portion of it does consist of EVs.” Specifically, Grab has over 10,000 electric bikes in its fleet in Indonesia, which it says is “the largest EV rental fleet in the country.”
While EVs are on their way to becoming commonplace, they currently come with infrastructure challenges. Without sufficient charging points and a clear government roadmap, drivers may hesitate to transition to EVs.

That said, countries such as Vietnam are seeing green shoots, with founders like Vingroup’s Vuong pushing for the development of an EV ecosystem. Pham aims to invest US$404 million in a new EV charging venture.
Such initiatives are likely to reap benefits for GSM, the first pure electric taxi company in Vietnam. It is already planning to recruit an additional 20,000 to 30,000 taxi drivers and 15,000 to 20,000 motorbike drivers to its existing fleet of 40,000 electric taxis and bikes, says CEO Nguyen.
According to a Reuters report, GSM had signed an unreported US$419 million deal with VinFast at the end of 2023 for deliveries of 14,600 additional EVs. VinFast is the EV manufacturer owned by Vuong, who is also the founder and chairman of Vingroup and owner of GSM.
Laos-based player Loca is also advocating for an electrification push in a bid to save costs. In Laos, where gasoline costs US$7 per 100 kilometers, charging an EV at a Loca station costs US$1.5 for the same distance, its co-founder and CEO Souliyo Vongdala tells Tech in Asia.
The company is already profitable, according to Vongdala. “Critically, our ability to control energy costs through our EV charging network shields us from fluctuations in oil prices,” he adds.
For larger companies, however, EVs still form only a small portion of their daily trips. Vietnam’s Be Group says that the figure for its operations is less than 2%.
“At this stage, EVs are only PR focused. Over time, as the total cost of EV ownership goes down and infrastructure improves, the order volumes will rise,” says Roshan Raj, partner at Redseer Strategy Consultants.
Kengo Kurokawa, founder and CEO of research firm Asia Plus, shares similar views. In the Reuters report, he expressed concerns regarding the sustainability of GSM’s ride-hailing business model due to its “high cost structure and the market’s low profitability.” He suggested that GSM primarily serves as an advertising tool for VinFast.
The report noted that while Vingroup agrees profitability for GSM may not be immediate, it anticipates that the firm will hit the milestone “well before 2030.”
Steering toward consolidation
While the new players are vying to get a share of the pie from Grab, no one has yet reached the scale to take the company head on.
Instead, some are rooting for partnerships in a bid to make a country-specific dent in Grab’s operations.

“There is still scope for country-specific niche players to increase the competitive intensity, However, when it comes to seamless connectivity using a single app, Grab is hard to beat,” says Shekhar Jaiswal, an analyst at RHB Banking Group.
Recognizing this, Be Group has partnered with GSM in Vietnam, which can be seen as a strategic move against Grab in the country. GSM also expanded into Laos last year, penetrating a market where neither Grab nor Gojek have yet established a presence.
Estonia’s Bolt has not done any significant M&amp;A deal so far, but it isn’t closing the door on acquisitions. According to founder and CEO Markus Villig, the company hasn’t yet found a business “that meets its high acquisition criteria.”
Not to be outdone, Grab is also in the process of acquiring Trans-Cab, Singapore’s third-largest taxi operator, which will give it control over 2,200 taxis and more than 300 private-hire vehicles.
See also: Does combining Grab with asset-heavy Trans-cab make sense?
However, the acquisition is under review by the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore. Deal-making has become more challenging for a dominant player like Grab, due to increased scrutiny from regulators aiming to safeguard competition.
In any case, Trive Venture Capital’s Quek notes that it is unnecessary for smaller ride-hailing providers to aim to take over Grab. “It makes sense to do a follow-the-leader strategy and obtain a sensible market share where it is profitable,” he says.","Could emerging competitors with their new commission models pose a threat to Grab’s dominant position, or is the listed company’s top spot secure?",Samreen Ahmad,"Editing by Simon Huang, Lorenzo Kyle Subido, and Thu Huong Le",open,0,"",https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1713133830_fi-is-grabs-ride-hailing-business-future-proof.png,false,"",false,true,true,true,false,8,,1823,Is Grab’s ride-hailing business future-proof?,"Could emerging competitors with their new commission models pose a threat to Grab’s dominant position, or is the listed company’s top spot secure?",,,"","",""

In a major restructuring drive, Byju‘s co-founder Byju Raveendran will take over the day-to-day operations of the edtech business from India CEO Arjun Mohan.
After spending seven months reviewing Byju’s operations and spearheading cost optimization exercises at the company, Mohan will now transition to an external advisory role, Byju’s said in a statement.
Following this review, the company is consolidating its businesses into three divisions: the learning app itself, test-prep services, and online classes and tuition center operations. Each vertical will operate independently under its own leadership.
“This new structure will enable each vertical to be nimbler, cost-efficient, and better equipped to capitalize on market opportunities,” said the company.
Over the past four years, Raveendran focused primarily on strategic aspects such as raising capital and driving global expansion.
“By focusing on our core strengths with three specialized business units, we will unlock new growth opportunities while continuing to focus on profitability,” he said.
However, Raveendran taking charge of the company’s daily operations can be a polarizing move, as investors have been pushing for the removal of both him and his wife, Divya Gokulnath, from leadership roles within the firm.
Aside from a legal dispute with investors, Byju’s has been facing severe financial challenges. Its valuation has seen a steep cut of over 95% from US$22 billion at its peak to US$1 billion as it struggles to raise funds, disburse salaries, and pay off debt.

Companies handle anywhere from 1,000 to 100,000 documents in various formats on a monthly basis, and they usually rely on manual processes due to the unstructured nature of the data, says Paul Santos, managing partner at Wavemaker Partners.
To speed this up, Wavemaker Partners has invested in Staple, a Singapore-based startup that applies AI to provide document processing solutions.
The VC firm has led a US$4 million pre-series A funding round in the startup, which can process various document types across over 200 languages.
Staple has been helping solve documentation issues since 2018, and for good reason. The procedure is prone to error, and each mistake could cost firms US$50 to rectify, which could result in millions of dollars in unnecessary expenses annually, Santos added.
With Staple, companies can automate data extraction and financial workflows. Some of the solution’s use cases include scanning invoice data, analyzing bank statements, and examining forms at scale.
The funding will help refine the firm’s AI-powered tech and adapt its services for diverse business needs. The company, which already has a presence in over 56 countries, will also use the capital for global expansion.

Used-car marketplace Carro plans to raise around US$100 million as it gets IPO-ready, possibly bringing the firm’s valuation to over US$1.5 billion, CEO Aaron Tan said in an interview with Bloomberg.
Tan said in the interview that while the Singapore-based firm was raising funds, “we are ready for an IPO.” He clarified, however, that the decision to list will depend on the broader macro environment.
Carro plans to raise the funds over the next six months, Tan told Tech in Asia. It will mainly use the funds for market expansion, with M&amp;A deals in Hong Kong and Japan taking the bulk of the proceeds, he added.
While the raise could boost investor trust for the upcoming listing, setting the stage for an IPO extends beyond regional platform dominance, according to Yinglan Tan, founding managing partner at Insignia Ventures Partners – an early investor in Carro.
Hence, it is “important that Carro wins a few more markets in Asia Pacific,” Insignia’s Tan told Bloomberg, adding that the used-car marketplace has the potential to grow big in Hong Kong and Japan.
Hong Kong’s automotive market has recently shown signs of recovery from the Covid-19-induced downturn in 2020, bolstered by its geographic advantage and government support, among other factors. In Japan, meanwhile, the industry logged a 27% growth year on year in the first half of 2023.
Carsome, Carro’s Malaysia-based rival, has also been making moves ahead of its anticipated IPO, recently reorganizing its leadership team.
Over the past nine years, Carro and Carsome have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into acquiring inventory and establishing delivery networks, among other internal investments.
Such initiatives have helped Carro post an EBITDA of US$33 million in FYE 2024, a substantial jump from US$4 million in the previous year.

Why Grab will be hard to beat despite new competitors in ride-hailing
Netflix’s video game business in Vietnam, Microsoft’s AI investment in Japan, and Bain Capital selling its remaining stake in India’s Axis Bank 
Jack Ma praises Alibaba’s restructuring efforts, but words alone won’t save a floundering share price 


Hello reader,
I recently tried calling for a ride using GrabShare Beta, the mobility platform’s carpool service which was introduced last year.
I was asked to wait for six minutes. During that time, Grab’s app tried to match me with a driver as well as another passenger who I could share a ride with in exchange for a lower fare.
Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to find a match and ended up booking a normal ride.
I didn’t think too much of it. After all, I wasn’t in a rush and didn’t mind waiting. But some riders may be annoyed at the wasted time and failure to find a match.
That’s the issue with innovation. While riders appreciate the wider range of options, things don’t always work out, leading some to view Grab negatively.
But this hasn’t stopped the company from introducing new services. Apart from GrabShare Beta, the platform recently launched a new group-share feature that allows passengers to plan a trip together.
This is part of the company’s efforts to attract and retain users who are able to access other up-and-coming ride-hailing services.
As my colleague Samreen covers in this week’s featured story, some of these challengers include Be Group and GSM in Vietnam, as well as Tada and Ryde in Singapore.
Despite the increased competition, Grab is going to be hard to beat. As Samreen’s piece notes, the platform was able to raise over US$16 billion in an environment of easy money that is now over.
Niche players, however, might be able to turn the heat up on Grab in individual markets or look to countries like Laos where the super app is not present in.
And one lesson in tech is never to assume that dominance lasts forever. A change in tech paradigms – for example, a widespread adoption of EVs – might be an opportunity for a new player to challenge the incumbents.
We’d all welcome more innovation and affordable options. For example, as a dog owner who doesn’t own a car, I’d certainly welcome a more affordable option to GrabPets!

THE BIG STORY

Is Grab’s ride-hailing business future-proof?
Could emerging competitors with their new commission models pose a threat to Grab’s dominant position, or is the listed company’s top spot secure?

3 Trends to keep an eye on
Hot stocks, earnings reports, restructuring, pressure from activist investors, and more.

1️⃣ Seeing red in Vietnam: The Southeast Asian country has directed Netflix (NFLX, NDAQ) to discontinue its video games business there by April 25, as the company lacks the required gaming services license.
Global tech giants may be used to getting their way, but they’re also facing increasing scrutiny from governments and regulators, even in countries like Vietnam that are generally perceived to be business-friendly.
However, this shouldn’t deter the streaming giant from investing in the market. It is planning to open an office in Vietnam, which would make it the first US tech major to have a physical presence there.
An on-the-ground presence may also improve relationships with the local authorities. If major tech companies are serious about growing in Southeast Asia, more of them should follow Netflix’s example.
2️⃣ Land of the rising…AI?: Microsoft (MSFT, NDAQ) is making its biggest investment in Japan, with plans to invest US$2.9 billion to upgrade its AI and cloud services in the country.
The software company aso plans to train over three million people in AI in three years, which will provide relevant skills to workers and accelerate the country’s digital transformation.
The two parties seem to be a good match.
Faced with a declining population, Japan will have to lean heavily on increasing productivity to continue growing its GDP.
Meanwhile, Microsoft will have more opportunities in what is still the world’s third-largest economy, even as the second largest, China, increasingly closes itself off to US tech enterprises.
3️⃣ Bain Cap is out: Bain Capital is selling its entire stake in India’s Axis Bank (AXISBANK, NSE). Does this signal froth in the Indian market?
Bain Capital first invested in Axis Bank as part of the latter’s capital raise in November 2017 at a price of 565 rupees per share.
The investment firm previously offloaded some of its shares in November 2022, and again in December 2023.
As of the end of trading on April 11, the bank’s shares were trading at 1,084 rupees per share. Its price-to-earnings ratio of 25.1x was higher than peers such as HDFC Bank, State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, and Indusind Bank.
Is Bain Cap’s disposal of Axis’ shares a sign that it thinks they are fully valued? Or maybe this is just par for the course in private equity, with funds that have a limited lifespan.

The one you didn’t see coming
We spotlight the story that had everyone talking and social media buzzing during the past week.

Jack Ma during a conference in Paris, France in 2019 / Photo credit: Shutterstock

Ma rallies Alibaba staff with rare letter: Alibaba (BABA, NYSE) founder Jack Ma has kept a low profile in the past few years, but he recently wrote to the company’s employees on the first anniversary of its restructuring.
He noted that over the past year, the company had transformed “from an organization with slow decision-making back to one that prioritizes efficiency and the market, making the company simple and agile again.”
Ma also predicted that three years from now, “ecommerce will definitely not be as popular as it is today” but also thought that the company was “right on time” to ride on the AI era, which “has just begun.”
The restructuring of Alibaba was meant to address some of these challenges, with the tech conglomerate splitting into six separate business units, which could each raise capital from the markets.
But US-China tensions subsequently led the company to scrap plans to spin-off its cloud business, and it recently decided not to proceed with listing its logistics arm Cainiao.
In contrast with Ma’s positive tone, company insiders have criticized the firm’s inability to compete against rivals like Pinduoduo (PDD, NDAQ), harness AI developments, and break into western markets.
Founders are perhaps the best-placed individuals to take a company through tough times. However, Ma is ultimately still on the sidelines, with no day-to-day role. It’s going to take more than words from Ma to get Alibaba – whose shares have fallen by over 75% from their October 2020 peak – back on track.

That’s it for this edition – we hope you liked it!

India-based Zomato has exceeded the stock market gains of all top global delivery services over the past year, prompting analysts to revise their forecasts for the food discovery app, Bloomberg reported.
Analysts’ estimates went up as Zomato’s stock soared 260% since April 2023. According to data from Bloomberg Intelligence, price target increases for Zomato outpaced stocks of ride-sharing and delivery firms worldwide. These include projections from companies like Citigroup and HSBC Holdings.
As Zomato’s growing operations helped dispel concerns about losses, analysts have also changed their estimates for the company to profits.
The Bloomberg report noted that optimism is high not only for Zomato’s delivery business but also for its quick commerce arm, Blinkit. Specifically, Goldman Sachs Group projects a profit boost in this area, given Zomato’s recent performance.
Zomato paid US$ 570 million to acquire Blinkit in 2022. However, Zomato’s early investors questioned the profitability of Blinkit’s business model at the time, analyst Manish Adukia told Bloomberg.
Despite recently hitting break-even, Zomato’s shares already reflect over US$300 million in profits. While some have expressed concern, analysts like Abhisek Banerjee from ICICI Securities justified the high valuation, citing the the high revenues and profits that Zomato could generate.

Hi readers,
As a reporter, there are occasions when you immerse yourself in comprehending a trend to such an extent that you overlook the big picture.
This occurred to me while researching the trend of startups “reverse flipping” to India, which means relocating their parent entity back to their home country.
Although the trend is evident, my story failed to highlight the significant point that it costs millions of dollars to reverse flip back to India, as it got buried within the narrative.
Following discussions with my manager, I came to the realization that this should be the headline of the story. Consequently, we made adjustments aimed at providing readers with greater clarity on the “why” behind this trend: Why are Indian startups willing to invest heavily in a reverse flip?
Even after years of reporting, I understand writing articles is a continuous learning journey, with each piece offering its own lessons to learn.

Hello reader,
Sometimes, I like to poke a little fun at how startups are named. A common approach is to choose a familiar term then replace one of the vowels with a letter that doesn’t change how the word is typically pronounced. That’s how we end up with names like Ryde instead of Ride or Lyft rather than Lift.
Once in a while, though, you get a firm like Terminus – our top-funded startup for this week – that bucks this trend.
It sounds a little bit like a name from Transformers, doesn’t it? (I wonder if Terminus and Optimus Prime are brothers.) But Google tells me that Terminus refers to a Roman god who protected boundary markers. All things considered, the name sounds pretty cool to me.

Behind the Glasswall

Fundraising often involves reaching out to multiple contacts, many of whom founders might not have dealt with before. To provide some transparency to this process, we created Glasswall, a platform for founders to give feedback and recommendations on investors. Check out the full list here.

✅︎ “Navigating the challenging landscape of fundraising, especially in the early stages, can indeed be a daunting task. However, encountering investors like Arya and the Prasetia team can be transformative for a startup’s journey. I vividly recall our initial meeting, held at a time when our revenue stream was still nascent, primarily coming from WhatsApp through my role as an admin.
What struck me most during that encounter was not just Arya’s investment acumen, but the profound level of trust and support they extended to us from day one. Their belief in our vision, despite the modest beginnings, was incredibly motivating. It wasn’t merely about the numbers or the metrics; it was about recognizing the potential and the passion behind our endeavor.” – Read more  
❌ ”There’s a lot of focus currently on Wavemaker Impact and ESG initiatives which results in two camps. One camp where people are building real business, sound unit economics etc, and the other camp, frankly more fluff and magic powder than anything else.
No surprises which camp we are writing for. All for ESG, Impact, but please ensure unit economics are sound. After all, if the business folds after a few months/year, there’s no one getting “impacted” except a few readers online that clicked on the blogs.” – Read more   
✅︎ “ACV has been really helpful in many ways to our business. They’re not the hands-off kind, but in a good way. They’ll willingly share information, make connections even unprompted. ACV team also helps us with other areas such as PR management and hiring process.. They’re your best supporter and cheerleader all the way through.” – Read more

After a slew of issues in other parts of the world, TikTok said it tripled the merchant base and average sales on its app in Vietnam last year, Nikkei reported.
The surge is partly due to sales of items like VinFast motorcycles and Samsung phones, as Vietnamese shoppers become more comfortable with online shopping, a TikTok Vietnam representative said.
Vietnam was found to be one of the fastest-growing digital economies in the region by the 2023 e-conomy SEA report, with the country’s estimated gross merchandise value expected to jump by 31% from US$23 billion in 2022 to US$49 billion by 2025. The report cited “a booming ecommerce sector” as the driving force behind this growth.
For TikTok, Vietnam’s bigger appetite for online shopping means it has become a central revenue contributor for its business in Southeast Asia. However, representatives did not disclose official numbers.
As of early 2024, TikTok Shop users in Vietnam had reached 67 million. The Nikkei report noted that it is the country’s second-largest ecommerce site in terms of market share, ahead of Lazada but trailing Shopee.
The Nikkei report credited TikTok’s success to its decision to set up a physical office in Vietnam five years ago. In contrast, competitors like Facebook and YouTube still do not have a physical presence in the country.
Analysts have previously noted that TikTok is a serious threat to incumbents in Southeast Asia’s ecommerce sector. A Morgan Stanley analysis in August 2023 said that TikTok’s monthly active users had surpassed Shopee’s since March 2021.
In the US, however, TikTok is still facing a potential ban, with the Chinese government’s influence on the app being the biggest point of contention.

The global spacetech industry has seen a lot of activity recently. Startups in the industry have collected 31% more funding in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to Q3, carried by record launch numbers and government-backed projects, a Space Capital report noted in January this year.
While startups from East Asia have received much of the attention, with Japanese space cleanup firm Astroscale eyeing a Tokyo listing soon after a US$76 million raise last year, Singapore is not far behind with Qosmosys’ US$100 million seed round in October 2023.
Another spacetech startup in the city-state looking to take on the global stage is Aliena, which recently secured US$5.6 million in a recent series A financing round.
The round was headed by Wavemaker Partners, with contributions from institutional investors like Seeds Capital, Cap Vista, Paspalis, and NTUitive.
The company plans to use half of its raised amount to upgrade and relocate its facility for jet propulsion testing, its co-founder and CEO Mark Lim told Tech in Asia.
Strong boosters
Spacetech is a varied industry. While Astroscale focuses on cleaning space debris and Qosmosys looks to help businesses develop operations on the moon, Aliena specializes in electric propulsion systems.
With this, Lim said that Aliena’s tech is application agnostic. Whether a company builds satellites for telecoms and observation or for emerging applications like quantum key distribution, secure distribution of information, and deep-stage missions, the company can serve them.
This also helps Aliena reach global markets, the executive said. The firm currently has customers from the UK and the European Union, adding to its Asian operations. As Aliena is only just starting to ramp up its business, it currently has five customers.
Lim shared that Aliena has been contracted to help build a very-low-Earth orbit (VLEO) satellite. It will custom-build a version of its off-the-shelf system to be provided for Singapore’s remote sensing VLEO satellite.
Propulsion systems for VLEO operations are highly specialized, as lower flight levels introduce more air drag to the mix. This necessitates power-efficient and fuel-efficient engines that can still provide high thrust to combat drag – criteria that Aliena’s systems meet.
The company expects the satellite to be operational at VLEO in 2025.
More space for production
With the new funding, Aliena aims to boost engine production and improve testing. The upgrade would also allow the firm to onboard more clients, as it will be able to scale production of its jet propulsion systems to dozens. In the next two to three years, Lim expects this number to ramp up to the hundreds.
However, before having the capacity to get its systems to market, the company focused on research and development. This was the main revenue generator for Aliena from its inception through 2023, it said.
According to data from Alternatives.pe, which tracks filings in Singapore, Aliena generated US$726,000 in revenue for 2022, up from US$164,000 the year before. It did so while lowering its EBIT losses, which was possible as it focused on offering R&amp;D services at the time.
Aside from providing full systems and R&amp;D services, Aliena also offers space engine components, which clients can integrate into their own products.
Without providing exact numbers, Lim said that for 2023, R&amp;D still accounted for most of the company’s total revenue, but hardware sales also made up a “significant portion” of the figure.
In 2024, the company expects revenue, as well as capital expenditure, to rise as it continues to ramp up its production.

Hello reader,
“You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.”
I love this quote from The Dark Knight movie because it rings true. Many people start out with good intentions, but over time, their ideals may get corrupted as they lose faith.
They could also go the opposite direction and double down on their way of doing things until it’s not the right thing to do anymore. It’s kind of like how in Animal Farm, a lot of the pigs end up becoming oppressors themselves.
I feel like this applies not only to people but to ideas too. Many good ideas come from well-intentioned places, but over time they might change so much that they’re unrecognizable compared to the original, or they get co-opted by people with more sinister agendas.
Blockchain, it seems, falls into the latter category. While the underlying technology has remained consistent, much of how it’s executed in recent years hasn’t been inspiring. What was once a technology meant to improve security and trust eventually became the tool of choice for many grifters and scammers.
That’s why it’s nice to hear that there are blockchain firms out there that’s going back to the tech’s roots and focusing on its original tenets. Today’s story discusses one of these players: Stability Protocol.
Today we look at:

The Web3 firm eschewing crypto for its feeless blockchain
ByteDance’s 2023 numbers, which are looking good 
Other newsy highlights such as Microsoft’s planned US$2.9 billion investment in Japan and a Singaporean AI startup scoring US$5 million in seed money.

A bad reputation is often difficult to change, and blockchain tech has definitely gotten a bad rap over the last few years. Whether this can change on a large scale remains to be seen, but small steps in the right direction, like what Stability Protocol is doing, should be a good start.


Tipping point: According to Stability Protocol’s COO Klay Nichol, the breakthrough moment was when the firm was approved as a partner of Singapore’s Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA). 

Keep the ships coming (and going): Stability will start conducting live trials for IMDA’s TradeTrust framework this month, which is meant to help with digitalizing global trade documentation. 

Finding alternatives: As the platform operates without fees and the use of crypto, validators – who prevent fraudulent transactions by ensuring they follow a protocol’s rules – won’t be paid. Stability is currently in discussions with accounting firms, including Deloitte and EY, as well as leading cloud computing and enterprise resource planning providers to act as validators.

Don’t stop me now – it’s having such a good time

Image credit: Timmy Loen

It tickles me that despite many tech firms being extremely complex organizations, many of us in the sector like to look at just a few numbers – like revenue and profit – to sum them up. Number up = good. Number down = bad. Seems like we’ve still got a little caveman inside us. Regardless, ByteDance’s figures are looking good.


Soaring, flying, there’s not a star in heaven that it can’t reach: ByteDance’s earnings for 2023 rose to over US$40 billion, 60% higher than the previous year.  

On your left, Tencent: Total sales grew from US$80 billion to around US$120 billion, allowing it to overtake Tencent in revenue and profit for the first time. 

Speed bumps: That said, the firm is currently facing several hurdles, including a potential TikTok ban in the US. ByteDance recently avoided a similar fate in Indonesia, after it merged TikTok Shop with Tokopedia.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk / Photo credit: Shutterstock

Know as “India’s Detroit” – a US state known for its manufacturing prowess – the South Indian state Tamil Nadu is set to pursue Elon Musk’s Tesla aggressively for its electric vehicle manufacturing investment in the country, Bloomberg reported.
The news comes after Musk said he is set to visit the country, with the possibility of making a local investment.
While Tesla’s investment in India is not yet set on paper, Indian Industries Minister Thalikottai Rasuthevar Baalu Rajaa said Tamil Nadu will be pursuing opportunities for electric vehicle manufacturing “from all global car majors” as the state has the “best electric vehicle policies and ecosystem.”
At the moment, Tamil Nadu’s capital Chennai is already home to manufacturing factories of Nissan, Renault, Hyundai, and BMW. However, the state still plans to boost the car manufacturing hub’s capacity through new incentives.
In March, India reduced the import tariffs on EVs to as low as 15% if a company invests at least US$500 million and sets up a manufacturing plant in the country. This is down from a 70% to 100% rate before.
Previous reports have said that aside from Tamil Nadu, Tesla is also looking into setting up shop in Maharashtra and Gujarat, which also houses car manufacturing plants of Tata Motors and Hyundai. Both also have established infrastructure and ports to facilitate exports.
Reports of Tesla’s investment in India have long been brewing. In June 2023, Musk posted on X (formerly Twitter) that he is keen to invest in India “as soon as humanly possible” after meeting Indian prime minister Narendra Modi during his state visit to the US.
If Tesla’s investment pushes through, it comes at an opportune time for Modi, as he is also set for reelection in the country’s upcoming federal elections, beginning April 19.

Circles, the Singapore-based telco firm, has named Kannan Alagappan as its new CTO.
Alagappan brings decades of experience from his work across telecoms, media, and entertainment. Before Circles, Alagappan was CTO of US-based Dish Network, where he was responsible for helping over 10 million customers and generating up to US$12 billion in revenue.
He also held executive positions at companies like Comcast and T-Mobile, helping drive tech progression and smart scaling.
For this role, Alagappan will move from the US and will be based out of India, according to his LinkedIn page.
The appointment comes at a strategic time for Circles, as it aims to expand its global footprint.
The company serves clients in 15 markets including Japan and the Middle East. Around this time last year, the firm announced a joint venture with Abu Dhabi-based e&amp; International to springboard its business onto Middle Eastern markets.
In February, Circles hired Justin Choi as chief financial officer, Bart Weijermars as chief customer success officer, and Luke Lu as chief people officer.

VinFast has begun selling its VF DrgnFly electric bike in the US, retailing at US$2,599, the company said in a statement.
Revealed at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show in January, the VF DrgnFly offers smart features to its riders, connecting to a mobile app that handles its various driving modes and tracks ride data. The bike also has an energy optimization system that lets it travel up to 68 miles on one charge.
Customers can order through VinFast’s US dealers, with each bike coming with a two-year warranty.
Vingroup, VinFast’s parent firm, has been busy with scaling up over the past year. It outlined major expansion efforts in Indonesia, India, and the Philippines, which would cost VinFast hundreds of millions of US dollars.
Pham Nhat Vuong, founder of VinFast, has also launched adjacent ventures like e-motorcycle hailing service Green and Smart Mobility as well as EV charging station ecosystem V-Green.
However, this expansion presents a financial risk to Vingroup, with VinFast losing a total of US$5.7 billion in the last three years, Reuters reported. In 2023, the EV firm’s sales were below its 50,000 target, landing at just 35,000.
VinFast said it plans to triple its sales this year, though that comes amid global EV demand bearing uncertainty after a sluggish 2023.

This allocation will be shared evenly between Toyota Ventures Frontier Fund II (TVFF II) and Toyota Ventures Climate Fund II (TVCF II). The move brings the company’s managed assets to over US$800 million.
“With seismic breakthroughs in generative AI, e-fuels, space commercialization, carbon capture, and synthetic biology, it’s a crucial time to be investing for Toyota,” said Jim Adler, founder and general partner of Toyota Ventures.
With TVFF II, led by veteran investor David Sokolic, Toyota Ventures will back startups dealing with technologies like AI, robotics, cloud services, and quantum computing. It would follow in the footsteps of the first TVFF, which invested in the likes of satellite provider Starfish Space and quantum computing startup Haiqu.
In contrast, TVCF II will target firms working on climate change and environmental sustainability and will be led by Lisa Coca. Some of the first TVCF’s investments include firms working in renewable energy, energy storage, and hydrogen solutions, contributing to Toyota’s carbon neutrality goals.
Since launching in July 2017, Toyota Ventures has supported over 75 startups, leveraging Toyota’s global footprint and expertise. The company is based in the US but has portfolio firms across North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia Pacific.

Click here to read past articles.
Malaysia Venture Capital Management (Mavcap), the largest government-owned VC firm in the country, launched a roadmap last week that aims to take the startup space forward.
The 11 so-called “interventions” in the Malaysia Venture Capital Roadmap 2024-2030 were grouped into three overarching strategies: boosting the ease of doing business, improving funding accessibility, and elevating the country’s VC talent pool. The agency is also proposing a six-year timeline to execute these strategies.

TL;DR of the breezy 33-page report:

Seed new VCs
Urge more government-linked investment companies (GLICs) to invest
⁠Get VCs to use a centralized platform to monitor the latest information
⁠Make cross-border flow easier

Other figures bandied in the report include doubling VC total funding value by 2030. Total VC funding in 2022 stood at US$758 million across a deal count of 165, according to the roadmap.
Before I critique the roadmap and list what we need to watch out for, let me note the positives.
The good
For starters: Yay, we have a roadmap! This may sound juvenile, but a roadmap is better than nothing. It gives an idea of what Mavcap intends for VCs and the startup scene.
Secondly, some of the points that the agency raised in the report match some of the grouses on the ground. For example, Mavcap mentions seeding younger fund managers. This has been a problem in the Malaysian VC space for yonks, as institutional investors or government-owned agencies would only select a handful of usuals to execute investments.
Mavcap also pushes for the use of a centralized system, but this isn’t new. Malaysian observers would have spotted this in the country’s Budget 2024 document. The fact that it’s being reiterated here means there’s continuity, and that policy is being executed as we speak.
Thirdly, it gives readers of the report and the community at large some benchmarks. The problem with Malaysia’s fractious startup space is that while everyone is doing something, they are all in silos and targeting the same pool of VCs. With a roadmap, there’s now some clarity as to functions and mandates.
The good part about all these is that Mavcap’s roadmap comes at a time when the government is actually serious about startups and tech. The government is organizing a tech conference on April 22, where it will also unveil another policy. I assume that Mavcap’s VC roadmap will fit under this bigger document.
The bad
Now, let’s discuss the problems. First, what Mavcap is saying in its roadmap is what it was supposed to have been doing since its inception 20 years ago. It was the country’s premier VC, the first among equals.
Yet it floundered.
It neither raised a VC class nor invested in startups. The agency tried doing this at first, but it eventually joined the fund-of-funds bandwagon.
Second, Mavcap’s status as a government agency has been lowered. By this I mean it currently reports to sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional. Mavcap previously reported to the finance ministry or the economic affairs ministry, depending on the structure of the Cabinet.
Nowadays, Mavcap catches a cold if Khazanah sneezes. How seriously Mavcap will be taken all boils down to how much leeway Khazanah gives.
If Khazanah decides to junk Mavcap’s report, then this whole discussion is moot. I doubt that will happen, though. If anything, some interventions might be accepted while others might be put on the backburner.
The writing has long been on the wall for Mavcap. An obvious hint was when Budget 2018 was tabled, it was Cradle – not Mavcap – that was named as the coordinating agency for startups.
Mavcap faded into the ether after that, but then came its clone, Penjana Kapital.
Both are now under Khazanah, a set-up that created the existential dilemma of dealing with two overlapping entities. In addition, Khazanah is not short on collaborators, which include Antler and 500 Global. So what is Mavcap’s value-add here?
Lastly, much of the interventions that Mavcap mentions in its report relies on the government. This indicates that much of what the agency recommends is actually out of its hands.
Let’s take ease of capital flows, for example. The onus is on the central bank, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM). Mavcap is in no position to demand anything from BNM, which directly reports to the finance ministry.
What to watch for
Going forward, if Mavcap or any other politician talks about startups and benchmarks Malaysia against Singapore or they spout buzzwords such as “Silicon Valley of (fill in the blank),” then you’ll know this will be doomed to fail.
Here’s why: Singapore is a financial hub. That’s the design of the island republic, and it’s had ample time and built the expertise to take this position. Malaysia has never positioned itself that way, so it’s ridiculous to think that Mavcap’s roadmap – no matter how sound – would somehow transform us into the startup capital of Southeast Asia.
It’s just not going to happen. We can’t even catch up to Indonesia and Vietnam, what more Singapore? As for Silicon Valley … again, two different places with two different beginnings. While robust, Malaysia’s semiconductor space was not inspired by defense – unlike the US.
So if you see this sort of attitude being played up in the news, you might want to tone down your expectations.
The other developments to look at include the April 22 summit, where Malaysia’s high-tech policy will be launched, and Budget 2025, which will be tabled in October.
If these two present something similar to Mavcap’s roadmap, then we will see policy continuity and coherence, which may bode well for the country.","State-owned Mavcap has proposed “interventions” to drive the country’s startup scene forward, but the execution is not entirely in the agency’s hands.",Emmanuel Samarathisa,Editing by Terence Lee and Eileen C.

The decision to rebrand the Asia unit of GGV Capital as Granite Asia was a deliberate one, given that senior managing partners Jenny Lee and Foo Jixun wanted a connection with what they had built.
“It helps because so much of it was us,” Lee told The Business Times, in a reference to the work that she and Foo put in as members of the founding team of GGV.
While Granite Asia might be thought of as a throwback to GGV Capital, it has been refashioned, as it were. From March 30, 2024, Granite Asia took a different path from GGV Capital by making the Asia-Pacific region its focus. It also expanded its asset classes, moving beyond providing venture capital to funding and supporting founders and their ideas.
The multiasset platform is also looking to launch a credit product to complement its existing equity financing strength, so it will combine the power of equity and debt to aid founders on their journey.
“If you look at an entrepreneurial journey, you will see that the type of financing and support needed is actually multifaceted,” said Foo.
Granite Asia will invest in themes such as consumer growth and transformation, enterprise workflow and supply chain, food systems and sustainability, health innovation and wellness, as well as energy transition and automation.
Granite Asia is looking to invest into a new infrastructure for a world that’s adapting to shifting geopolitics. Where GGV Capital used to cover Southeast Asia, China, and India, Granite Asia is pivoting to the Asia-Pacific, where Lee and Foo believe they have an edge in operating.
“It’s even more important to have investors and board members who can help connect the dots on a global basis,” Lee said. “Entrepreneurs and companies that can do that and navigate this complex world will do better.”
The lessons that the two partners will take from GGV Capital to Granite Asia include both strategic and tactical considerations, from investment structure to positioning brands. To be effective, Granite Asia will draw on its advisors for their input so that plans are made with longer time horizons, said Lee.
In their time in the venture-investing game, both partners helped build 48 unicorns. They have also seen how companies scale their businesses, a complex undertaking in the Asia-Pacific, a fragmented region where a one-size-fits-all strategy will not work.
“We are building a platform with key members from across the region, so we are able to help our portfolio companies navigate,” said Foo.
Managing Granite Asia’s current portfolio companies is keeping the pair busy. They help founders navigate today’s challenging macro environment, including fundraising, restructuring, or even deciding where to list.
The expanded list of asset classes will also take up time.
“We have to continue to add to our team the right expertise and to extend our strategy aggressively but also cautiously, with the right partners in the region,” said Lee.
Granite Asia is also looking to reaffirm its pool of global investors, who remain limited partners following the rebranding. Lee stressed the need to keep communications with these investors open as the firm continues to do the work.
Lee and Foo, ever aware that companies are successful only because of the team at the table also want to work at making more friends and maintaining existing relationships.
“In Asia, it’s not just the private sector. It is also the ability to not just connect the dots globally but also to do so among public, private, and entrepreneurs,” said Lee.

Singapore’s Temasek has officially opened an office in Paris, aiming to widen its opportunities in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA).
The Paris office strengthens the state-owned investment firm ‘s current European footprint, joining its London and Brussels branches. This is Temasek’s 13th site across nine countries.
A company spokesperson told The Straits Times that Temasek plans to invest US$14 billion to US$18 billion in the EMEA region over the next five years.
Temasek’s investments in the EMEA region have increased 5x since 2011, amounting to US$34.7 billion – or about 12% of its portfolio – as of March last year. Its key investments in Europe include German biotech company BioNTech and Dutch payments major Adyen.
Meanwhile, Temasek is one of the most active investors in Asia. It has invested in companies like Alibaba, Grab, and GoTo, and it has roughly 20 investment firms and a venture-building arm under its umbrella.
The company also started launching its own startups in 2020, having rolled out 15 of them as of this year.
Last month, it was reported that Temasek is considering placing its chip on OpenAI. If a deal goes through, Temasek would be the first state-backed investor of the ChatGPT developer.
The move would complement Singapore’s lofty AI ambitions. The city-state is betting big on the tech, having committed US$742 million in investments to its AI industry over the next five years.

Software and consulting firm Xto10x, a company established by Flipkart co-founder Binny Bansal, has reported a revenue of S$18.9 million (US$14 million) from January 2022 to March 2023 for its Singapore-listed entity, according to Alternatives.pe, which tracks regulatory filings in the city-state. This marks a nearly 3x rise from US$4.7 million in FYE 2021.
The majority of this revenue came from consultancy services, which rose from US$4.3 million in 2021 to US$13.2 million for FYE March 2023.
To date, the company has worked with over 200 companies, including hospitality startup RedDoorz, food delivery major Swiggy, and fintech firm Cred.
Tech in Asia has reached out to Xto10x for comment.
Xto10x had some firepower to work with for the reported period. It raised US$25 million in a round from Bansal himself, who is a co-founder at the company.
During the period, Xto10x also benefited from its September 2021 acquisition of HR SaaS firm Dockabl, which enabled it to scale its employee engagement and strategy execution platforms called 10xPeople and 10xGoals, respectively.
The company posted a gross profit of US$7.3 million during the 15 months ended March 2023, an improvement from a loss of US$1.8 million in 2021. It was also cash-flow positive, holding US$1.5 million in cash for the period.
But as administrative expenses ballooned from US$0.8 million in 2021 to US$12.6 million in FYE 2023, Xto10x doubled its losses in the 15-month period to US$5.3 million from US$2.7 million in FYE 2021. This rise in expenses mostly came from a jump in share-based payment expenses to employees in the period.
Since it was founded in India in 2019, Xto10x has been helping startups scale through its expertise in areas like business design, organizational leadership, people and culture, as well as growth and product.
The company also provides its services to Southeast Asian startups, with Singapore acting as its base in the region.

Hello reader,
How does a business survive without much – or any – money coming in?
Companies had to figure this out when the Covid-19 pandemic struck in 2020. The hospitality sector was hit particularly hard as, after all, very few of us were traveling.
Lots of firms went out of business, but Singapore-based RedDoorz managed to stick around. CEO Amit Saberwal says that was partially thanks to support from the company’s internal investors, and it seems like that faith could pay off soon.
RedDoorz says it hit cash flow positive late last year and is eyeing profitability in 2024. Turns out, a business runs a whole lot smoother when cash is coming in.
Today we look at:


Fresh investment for RedDoorz after hitting cash flow landmark 
Cybersecurity firm Sprinto scores US$20 million in funding

Premium summary
RedDoorz sets sights on profitability

Hospitality firm RedDoorz has raised US$28.2 million in fresh funding from returning investors Asia Partners and Mirae Asset Venture Investment, among others.


Milestone: RedDoorz CEO Amit Saberwal told Tech in Asia that the company hit group cash flow positive in the fourth quarter of 2023. While he didn’t give specific figures, Saberwal said the firm was set up for profitability and self-sufficiency this year.

Step by step: The firm broke even in the Philippines and Indonesia in the fourth quarter of 2022. These two markets contribute 95% of RedDoorz’s business.

Diversified: Tech in Asia data shows that RedDoorz previously raised more than US$134 million in investment. As well as operating hotels, the firm generates revenue by offering micro products such as early check-in or late check-out, paid loyalty programs, insurance, flexible cancelation policies, and breakfast.

Sprinto, a security and compliance firm based in India and the US, has raised US$20 million in its series B funding round.
The cybersecurity company raised the funding from Accel, Elevation Capital, and Blume Ventures.


Earmarked: The new funds will be used on Sprinto’s R&amp;D efforts, particularly in AI and intelligent automation, said the firm’s CEO Girish Redekar. The capital will also be used to split the company’s risk and compliance features into distinct products.

Growth industry: Market research and consulting firm Gartner has predicted that global security and risk management spending will grow 14% in 2024 compared to last year. The rising prevalence of hybrid work as well as increased adoption of cloud and AI tech are set to drive this boost.

Business model: Sprinto was founded in 2020 and automates information security compliance and privacy laws. Its clients are mainly software-as-a-service companies.

India’s service industry contributes over 50% to the country’s GDP, and the IT sector plays a significant role within it. But as the world catches up with generative AI, the sector must also gear up with new solutions – some of the country’s top IT firms are training as many as 400,000 employees in AI-specific roles.
One player eyeing this space is Neysa, an India-based AI cloud and platform-as-a-service startup. The company has landed US$20 million in seed funding in a round led by Matrix Partners India, Nexus Venture Partners, and NTTVC.
Founded in 2023 by Sharad Sanghi and Anindya Das, Neysa plans to roll out services aimed at making AI project management efficient and secure. Essentially, it’s a cloud-based platform for businesses to easily deploy, train, and manage generative AI models.
“Neysa was conceived from a deep understanding of the day-to-day challenges faced in managing and scaling cloud and the transformative potential of AI,” said Das in a statement. “This funding boosts our mission to democratize AI, empowering companies of all sizes to ignite innovation and drive growth.”
The company is targeting a Q3 2024 launch for its services.
AI is fast becoming a priority in India’s tech space, with the country’s government recently launching a US$1.2 billion AI mission that aims to increase innovation in the space through public-private partnerships.
Of that amount, US$240 million has been earmarked for financing deeptech startups, with a focus on accelerating R&amp;D in these firms.

Photo credit: Elliott Cowand Jr / Shutterstock

Vietnam has directed Netflix to discontinue promoting and providing video games in the country by April 25, Reuters reported. This directive stems from Netflix’s lack of a gaming services license, says Vietnam’s Authority for Broadcasting and Electronic Information (ABEI).
The streaming giant had stepped into the gaming world with the launch of Netflix Games, a mobile gaming feature available in its apps, in November 2021. However, Vietnamese law stipulates that only companies that are locally incorporated and registered as a video games service may offer them in the country.
ABEI also directed Netflix to stop offering its gaming feature on the app versions available on the country’s App Store and Google Play Store before the set deadline.
Previously, the Vietnamese government had banned the Netflix streaming of the Hollywood movie Barbie and the Chinese-produced Netflix drama series Flight to You due to “geopolitical reasons.”
It was reported last year that Netflix is planning to open an office in Vietnam, with the company having already conducted a risk assessment of the move.

A year after restructuring Alibaba Group amid increasing competition, Jack Ma posted a memo on the Alibaba intranet in a bid to boost morale among his staff. Below is Ma’s letter, translated from Mandarin to English using ChatGPT and lightly edited to align with our style standards.
To reform, to innovate
— Written on the first anniversary of Alibaba’s restructuring
In these past few days, many people have sent me videos of Joe [Tsai]’s interviews. Some have said to me that this video reveals our past mistakes with great openness. Indeed. Thank you to Joe for his courage and sense of responsibility. Making mistakes is not terrifying; nobody is immune from errors. What’s truly terrifying is not knowing, not acknowledging, and not correcting them.
In the past 25 years, Alibaba has achieved numerous successes, innovations, and leadership positions. But in these 25 years, we have also made countless mistakes. In the coming 77 years, we will continue to make mistakes along the way.
Facing problems calmly is not about negating the past but responsibly seeking the path to the future. Without blaming the past, without complaining about others, the era has changed, and we must keep pace with it.
We must not only courageously admit and promptly correct yesterday’s issues but also reform toward the future. This is why we keep moving forward.
Last year, I wrote on the intranet: Alibaba will change, Alibaba will transform. In the past year, Cai Chongxin and Wu Yongming, with admirable courage and wisdom, have led Alibaba through a series of future-oriented reforms.
The most fundamental change this year is not about chasing KPIs but about recognizing ourselves and returning to the track of customer value. We have tackled the problems of a big company, transforming from an organization with slow decision-making back to one that prioritizes efficiency and the market, making the company simple and agile again.
The new management team faces problems and the future head-on, believes in young people, fully empowers young teams, and decisively chooses what we need and what we don’t. Our idealistic aspirations and the mission of “making it easy to do business anywhere” will never change.
However, the new management team has made various changes in the past year, not only breaking through the hardened strategies of yesterday but also shaping the future Alibaba.
From B2B to Taobao, to Alipay, and then to Alibaba Cloud, our innovation has never been about pursuing higher profits but about striving to survive in an era of rapid change. Our innovation is not about changing others but about changing ourselves. Our innovation has never been about surpassing competitors but about catching up with the future.
Innovation is not about being trendy; it tests your true survival capability. It requires you to overturn your cognition from within, to challenge yourself forever and to do things that others dare not, don’t want to, or haven’t done.
In the face of this era of tremendous technological change, a span of three to five years is like a century in the internet field, enough to bring about earth-shattering changes. I believe that in three years, ecommerce will definitely not be as popular as it is today.
What’s important is not catching up with the present but thinking about how to improve the consumer experience of tomorrow’s ecommerce. The AI era has just begun, everything is just beginning, and we are right on time!
This year, amid numerous doubts and pressures internally and externally, I have seen a strong and brave Alibaba team being born. When talking about reform and innovation, the scariest thing is turning these two words into slogans.
Reform and innovation are painful because reform comes at a cost, and innovation is something you grind out step by step. Organizational changes and restructuring involve every employee.
Thank you to all Alibaba employees for their dedication and responsibility this year. Thank you and your families for choosing to believe and persevere amid continuous changes, even the decision regarding whether to IPO or not. I salute you.
It is your perseverance that has brought Alibaba back on track for healthy growth.
The road of reform and innovation will never be accompanied by applause because we are changing our favorite bad habits and vested interests. The road is long, but we won’t be alone in walking it.
In the future, we need to be more proactive and prompt in changing ourselves, and we need greater efforts in reform to establish a vibrant future for Alibaba.
Let’s go, Alibaba!

Mindverse, a Singapore-based AI startup, has obtained US$5 million in a seed funding round led by VC firm Square Peg.
The startup was founded in 2022 by former Meta executives and AI researchers. Its flagship products include MindOS Studio, which helps create AI-native websites with personalized chat experiences and interfaces, and Mebot, a productivity tool that learns and memorizes a user’s thoughts and preferences.
“We observed that people send emails to themselves when they think of something on the go, or when they come across a great article while they are browsing online,” said Felix Tao, Mindverse’s founder and CEO. “But these email threads are hard to organize and easy to forget.”
He noted that AI can help organize, retrieve, and regenerate one’s memories with ease, and is able to learn about one’s thinking patterns and preferences. As a result, it can provide more personalized services.
The startup will use the funding to further its research and product development to advance its large personalization model.
“We are in the midst of a generational AI shift that will move from generalized language models to personalized experiences (and) it is rare to find a team the caliber of Mindverse’s tackling this shift,” said Square Peg partner Tushar Roy.

844243,2024-04-11T01:55:57,2024-04-10T03:00:27,The key players in Indonesia’s beauty commerce space (update),key-players-indonesias-beauty-commerce-space-update,publish,visual-story,https://www.techinasia.com/visual-story/key-players-indonesias-beauty-commerce-space-update,"
Beauty commerce is one of the verticals that rode the ecommerce wave amid the pandemic. Even now, years after the first Covid-19 lockdowns were put in place, and with rising inflation squeezing disposable income, the global beauty market is still expected to grow by 6% a year from now until 2027.
In an Indonesia-focused survey conducted by research firm Jakpat, 81% of respondents said they shop for makeup products through ecommerce platforms, and 68% said they bought skincare products online.
Shopee remains the favorite among consumers for such purchases. According to market insights firm Compas, the Singapore-based company leads in ecommerce market share for the beauty and personal care category, with 63.5% in February 2024.

This year, the average Indonesian consumer is projected to spend US$27.2 on cosmetics and toiletries, up from US$20.2 in 2019.
And the country’s beauty and personal care market is expected to keep growing. Research firm Statista estimates that the segment in Indonesia will generate US$9 billion in revenue this year, with a compound annual growth rate of 18.7% from now until 2028.

One factor that supports this growth is the country’s demographics. According to government data, women made up 49.5% of its population in 2022, and most of them are of working age.

These trends have encouraged the creation of new startups in the beauty commerce sector. Many have built their own direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands combining sales channels through websites and ecommerce platforms such as Shopee, TikTok Shop, Sociolla, and Love and Flair.
While most of these brands are not VC-backed, several have raised funding, including Esqa, Rose All Day, Base, Somethinc, and Nama Beauty.
However, some brands are no longer active, including Norm, No Secret, and YC Combinator-backed Newman’s. Based on Tech in Asia’s observations, these companies are either no longer selling products through ecommerce platforms, their websites aren’t accessible, or they haven’t posted updates on social media for over a year.
In contrast, Sociolla, the leading beauty marketplace in Indonesia, has continued its aggressive expansion efforts offline over the past year. It currently has more than 60 physical stores across Indonesia, and just last month, it opened new ones in Jakarta, Surabaya, Bogor, and Cirebon. The company also entered Vietnam in 2020.
However, fundraising numbers fell significantly last year from US$100 million in 2022 to just US$5.4 million, which was from only one deal, an investment in Rose All Day.
SWC Global, DSG Consumer Partners, and AC Ventures participated in that investment round. The fresh capital came after the cosmetics firm grew its annual revenue by 4x in 2022, followed by a 6x growth in 2023.
Rose All Day, which was founded in 2017, attributes this to a combination of product traction, an increase in both online and offline distribution channels, and healthy customer retention. Similar to East Ventures-backed Esqa, Rose All Day also reported profitability after just 1.5 years of operations.

The significant decrease in funding in 2023 was likely due to investors being more cautious about backing startups, including in the beauty market, which has seen signs of a slowdown. In China, even deep discounts aren’t helping to boost sales during peak shopping events.
The situation might be different in Indonesia, where TikTok Shop, for instance, has experienced rapid growth due to the number of beauty product sales on its platform. Indeed, some see livestreaming as a good channel for selling makeup or skincare because consumers can see and inquire about the products in real time.
Here are the details on the funding rounds we’ve tracked:

We hope that as we constantly update our database, this will be a useful reference for anyone who’s interested in Indonesia’s beauty commerce space.

Despite a year filled with regulatory challenges, ByteDance‘s earnings soared in 2023 as its EBITDA rose to over US$40 billion, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. That marks a 60% increase from the prior year for the China-based parent firm of short-video app TikTok.
ByteDance is also gaining on its rivals. Its sales grew from US$80 billion to around US$120 billion, allowing it to overtake Tencent in revenue and profit for the first time, the sources added.
Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, is slowly eating into Alibaba’s ecommerce space and competing with Meituan in food delivery.
ByteDance has further diversified its overseas business with the rollout of TikTok Shop in the US and Southeast Asia.
However, TikTok is on the verge of being prohibited in the US unless ByteDance relinquishes ownership. A bill pushing for a ban on the app has been greenlighted by the US House of Representatives, but Senate approval is still unconfirmed.
Meanwhile, TikTok Shop sidestepped regulatory troubles in Indonesia through its tie-up with Tokopedia, the homegrown ecommerce giant that forms half of GoTo and Gojek.
ByteDance has also stepped back from high-risk ventures to focus on profitability, cutting hundreds of jobs in gaming and enterprise software – areas that did not meet its revenue expectations.
Instead, the company has zeroed in on AI, developing its own chatbots and language models. In August 2023, ByteDance launched a chatbot called Doubao after the nod from Chinese regulators.
However, ByteDance couldn’t seem to dodge controversy even in this industry. It’s in hot water for secretly using tech from OpenAI to build a competing product.
Nevertheless, ByteDance in December proposed buying back shares worth up to US$5 billion at a lower valuation of US$268 billion, falling from its peak of US$400 billion.

In the next two years, Microsoft plans to invest US$2.9 billion to upgrade its AI and cloud services in Japan.
This would be Microsoft’s largest investment in the country, reflecting the firm’s aim to enhancing Japan’s digital and AI capabilities.
Microsoft also plans to expand its digital training initiatives, with the goal to train over three million people in AI within three years. These include courses and resources specifically for AI development.
These programs will provide AI tech skills to workers and accelerate Japan’s digital transformation and adoption of AI.
The computing giant is also set to open Microsoft Research Asia in Tokyo, a facility focusing on fields like robotics and societal AI.
In line with its goals, Microsoft will donate US$10 million in resource grants over five years to The University of Tokyo and the Keio University-Carnegie Mellon AI Research Partnership.
In March, Japan and the US announced strategies to deepen their partnership in areas such as AI and semiconductor production. The collaboration follows the US’ efforts to block shipments of AI chips to China – a move that would hinder the Asian country from getting access to US tech that would bolster its own military capabilities.

We break down the big and messy topics of Asia’s tech and startup community. Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a premium subscription.
Hello reader,
Life is all about pivoting and adapting as you evolve and grow.
When I was younger, I wanted to be a journalist. That pushed me to study communications and take several journalism-related courses. Eventually, I realized I was too incurious to be a real journalist (kudos to my newsroom colleagues, who are always ready to dig deep).
So, I took the skills I picked up from school and went into partnership content and content marketing. That’s how I’ve ended up here, writing all sorts of fun things like this newsletter for Tech in Asia.
The same applies to businesses. A company can start out doing one thing and evolve into another, using the know-how it has built to diversify and tap into new opportunities.
That’s the case for Singapore-based logistics company Ninja Van, which is leveraging its years of last-mile delivery expertise in ecommerce to unearth new avenues for business growth.
Today we look at:


Ninja Van’s FY2023 earnings and its road ahead  
An antibiotic alternative startup that’s just raised funds 
Other newsy highlights such as Bain Capital’s exit from Axis Bank and a chipmaking giant’s significant US investment  


Premium summary
Looking beneath the surface

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Singapore-based Ninja Van has announced its results for the financial year 2023. The logistics firm’s revenue fell 7% year on year while its operating losses widened by 32% in the 12 months ending June 2023. Let’s take a closer look.


Stiff competition: Ninja Van is one of many logistics players that benefited from the rise of ecommerce in Southeast Asia, but the dynamic has shifted in recent years. The company has had to grapple not just with increasing competition from firms like J&amp;T Express, which pursued a “very aggressive” pricing strategy, but also with the stronger bargaining power of ecommerce firms, many of which are publicly listed companies trying to cut costs. 

Diversifying options: To that end, Ninja Van is looking beyond ecommerce. It has ventured into cold chain logistics and launched Ninja Mart, a service that helps big consumer goods firms deliver their products to provision stores located outside metropolitan areas. However, ecommerce will still be a key part of its story. 

Positive vibes: CEO Lai Chang Wen is optimistic about Ninja Van’s future, predicting that it would hit EBITDA breakeven in the next 12 months and break even on a net profit basis within another six months.

Startup spotlight
Not the antibiotics you know

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Ka-ching! Singapore startup Peptobiotics has raised US$6.2 million in a series A funding round led by Hatch Blue, an aquaculture-focused enterprise.


Tackling the problem: Founded in 2020, Peptobiotics aims to combat the farming and aquaculture space’s overreliance on antibiotics, which opens the door for bacteria to be more resistant. This is of significant concern in the US, where roughly 80% of antibiotics are used in animals, the company said.

How do they do it: Peptobiotics’s solution uses recombinant antimicrobial peptides, which are naturally occurring bacteria-inhibiting proteins.

Money moves: The new capital will help the firm take its antibiotic alternative for the farming and aquaculture sector to market.

1️⃣ Funding in the bag
India-based Filter Capital has finalized its debut fund after securing a corpus of US$96 million. The VC firm, which was founded by former Warburg Pincus executives, is eyeing investments in SaaS and tech services firms expanding globally from the country, notably those in series B and series C stages.
2️⃣ Are CEOs the school principal of a startup?
Byju’s-owned Aakash Educational Services Limited (AESL) has named Deepak Mehrotra as its managing director and CEO. The appointment aligns with AESL’s aim to improve and widen its operations, and will enable it to leverage Mehrotra’s business expertise from his stint at Pearson India.
The move comes shortly after Byju’s and AESL withdrew their merger petition in March due to issues with governance and share-swap arrangements.

Chipmaking giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) is planning to boost its US investment by over 60%, driving up its total to exceed US$65 billion. The Taiwan-based company is building three facilities in the US. Located in Arizona, TSMC’s inaugural plant is expected to churn out 4-nanometer chips and will start making them in 2025.

Alibaba seems to have fallen behind its Chinese ecommerce peers as of late. Shares of the then-immovable titan even took a back seat to rival Pinduoduo parent PDD Holdings in December 2023.
Since then, Alibaba has made key changes to simplify its business structure and boost efficiency.
In a memo to staff written on the one-year anniversary of Alibaba’s restructuring, co-founder Jack Ma said that the company has taken “a surgical approach to cure the ailments of a large company.”
The Chinese tech giant recently shelved the financial debut of its logistics arm Cainiao in Hong Kong. Instead, Alibaba sought to purchase all remaining shares in the unit, aiming to boost synergies between Cainiao and its ecommerce business.
However, according to Ma, Alibaba must continue to prioritize customer experience rather than blindly chasing growth.
Ma also expressed his excitement about the advent of AI tech and its impact on the ecommerce industry, exclaiming that “everything is just getting started and we are right on time!”
The memo follows Joe Tsai, Ma’s co-founder, sharing similar sentiments in a podcast interview with Nikolai Tangen of Norges Bank Investment Management.
Tsai said in the interview that Alibaba had forgotten who its real customers were, a development that eventually affected its share price. The company’s stock has dropped 77% from its 2020 peak, losing US$332 billion in market value to date.
However, Tsai, along with Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu, has been leading a broader change within the company – which Ma praised in his letter.

In today’s newsletter, we look at:

Indonesia-based fintech firm KoinWorks’ revenue and loss fluctuations

Why Tokopedia’s insurance partnership with Igloo makes sense

Patrick Walujo, the CEO of GoTo Group who delivered the company’s first quarterly profit


Hi there,
The issue of high default rates in Indonesia’s online lending industry has been dominating headlines, with individuals who lend via these platforms suffering losses. This got me thinking: Why do many online lending startups opt for a peer-to-peer (P2P) model instead of using their own funds?
One reason, of course, is scalability. P2P lending allows platforms to expand their operations more easily without requiring large amounts of upfront capital.
KoinWorks, a local fintech firm, employs both approaches. The company generates revenue through fees charged to borrowers and lenders, as well as interest income earned from lending its own money, as my colleague Jofie points out in this week’s Big Story.
Between 2021 and 2022, KoinWorks recorded a 71% jump in revenue to reach US$15 million, while its total loans disbursed increased by 107% to US$568 million over the same period. Nathan Yoles, the firm’s chief marketing officer, attributed part of the increase in loan volume to expanding product offerings beyond P2P lending.
The company also disclosed that its P2P lending vertical and its KoinWorks Bank unit have become profitable, although the overall group has not yet reached profitability – a milestone it plans to achieve later this year.
Another Indonesian company looking to hit that same milestone is insurtech firm Igloo. As part of its growth strategy, Igloo is partnering with ecommerce giant Tokopedia to offer damage protection insurance. More in the Hot Take.

THE HOT TAKE
Why Tokopedia wants to partner with insurtech firm Igloo

Here’s what happened:

Tokopedia has partnered with Indonesian insurtech firm Igloo to offer damage protection insurance on consumer goods such as gadgets and electronics.
The insurance policy will cover almost all of Indonesia’s districts.
This comes after Igloo announced a US$36 million pre-series C funding round led by French investment firm Eurazeo late last year.

Here’s our take:
Igloo joins Tokopedia’s long list of insurance partners, which includes Simas Insurtech and Fuse.
However, this partnership comes at an opportune time as both Tokopedia and Igloo are making big moves.
For one, Tokopedia completed its mega-merger deal with TikTok Shop in January, with the latter investing over US$1.5 billion in the merged entity over time.
As transaction volume on Tokopedia is expected to surge due to the TikTok boost, enhancing its insurance coverage will add more value to its products.
Meanwhile, in December 2023, Igloo raised US$36 million in a pre-series C round that increased its valuation by 50%.
The tie-up with Tokopedia aligns with Igloo’s expansion strategy, which includes a planned 20% increase in its workforce. This will allow it to cater to the ecommerce firm’s 18 million monthly active users, all while aiming to achieve profitability this year.
More importantly, Igloo brings onboard its experience in providing insurance products on regional ecommerce and other tech platforms. It has established partnerships with the likes of Lazada and Shopee in Singapore, Loship in Vietnam, GCash in the Philippines, and Dana in Indonesia.
Through the partnership with Tokopedia, Igloo will offer total damage insurance, protecting any products from accidental damage and liquid exposure. It will also cover losses due to theft or robbery.
The partnership also includes gadget and electronics insurance, which is among Igloo’s biggest growth contributors across Southeast Asia, as revealed by its CEO and co-founder Raunak Mehta in an earlier interview with Tech in Asia.
Igloo has a strong business proposition: The total damage insurance it offers covers “99% of districts.” Given Indonesia’s geographical challenges, with its vast archipelago comprising thousands of islands, delivery can be challenging and prone to mishaps.
An insurance plan will reassure both sellers and buyers, especially those in remote areas, that even if there are hiccups during transit, their products will be protected against potential damages and losses.
This extensive coverage, coupled with the Tokopedia-TikTok entity’s potential to capture 40% of the country’s ecommerce market share, may make Igloo more competitive in the insurtech industry.
So far, Igloo has issued more than 500 million policies. In comparison, PasarPolis – the first full-stack insurtech platform in Indonesia – has facilitated over 2 billion policies since its establishment in 2015. The latter firm is also approaching profitability.
It’s worth watching to see if Igloo will indeed become “the preferred insurtech partner for digital platforms,” as Mehta envisions.

843133,2024-04-10T06:00:31,2024-04-09T07:52:50,Why has motorcycle-mad SEA been slow to adopt two-wheel EVs?,motorcyclemad-sea-slow-adopt-twowheel-evs,publish,post,https://www.techinasia.com/motorcyclemad-sea-slow-adopt-twowheel-evs,"The electric vehicle sector is seen as key in the drive to curb climate change, and both governments and corporations have been formulating policies and infrastructure to support electric four-wheelers. Yet amid these advancements, the adoption of two-wheeler EVs in Southeast Asia has been surprisingly slow.
Motorcycles are the region’s dominant mode of transport, with an estimated 248 million new motorbikes registered from 2020 to 2022. This stands to reason: Motorcycles are more affordable than cars and better suited to navigating through crowded traffic conditions that are common throughout the region.

In both Indonesia and Vietnam, more than 70% of respondents to a survey listed private motorcycles as their main mode of transport.
Given this finding and a strong push for electrification in these markets, we should – in theory – see traditional internal combustion engine bikes quickly vanish.
However, the situation appears to be more nuanced. A report from the International Council on Clean Transportation shows that out of the 2.98 million two-wheeler sales in Vietnam in 2021, just 10% were EVs.
Though adoption rates of electric two-wheelers are increasing in Vietnam and Indonesia, there’s still a long way to go before these vehicles become the majority mode of transportation.
Interestingly, the market leaders for motorcycles in these countries don’t appear to be actively marketing EVs. A major reason could be a fear of cannibalization.
InnoVen Capital’s research found that top players in Vietnam and Indonesia have an estimated 70% market share. For these companies to lead the switch to e-motorbikes, retooling or setting up completely new factories would be a massive and costly undertaking.
While these major players may not have a big incentive to lead electrification, many believe that it’s a must for global decarbonization. This is where we need to see stronger initiatives from both the private and public sectors in addressing existing market gaps.
However, I believe smaller companies and startups also have a key role to play.
Revving up
Some of the important factors that will drive adoption of electric two-wheelers are costs, battery life, and range, as well as charging networks and infrastructure.
Two-wheelers in Southeast Asia are mainly used by lower-income segments of the population, who are extremely sensitive to costs. In our analysis, the total cost of ownership – including upfront and ongoing operating costs of an e-bike across a five-year period – is higher compared to traditional motorcycles.
While two-wheel EVs offer huge savings in maintenance and energy costs, these are currently not enough to offset the higher base prices.
Lowering the total cost of ownership to accelerate adoption is dependent on two pivotal factors.
Firstly, government subsidies and tax rebates are crucial to substantially bring down the high upfront costs. Another catalyst for adoption is financing, which will ensure that consumers don’t have to pay the full upfront cost of the bike.
Our market scan reveals that there are few specialist financiers for electric two-wheelers, and financing for such purchases is mostly done through credit card installment plans or consumer cash loans. This presents an area with increasing potential as more e-bikes are put on the roads.
To achieve good battery life and range, most two-wheel EVs use lithium-ion batteries, which are light, have a long range, and don’t need to be replaced often. Once these bikes are on the road, the question of infrastructure and battery charging starts to become important.
Unlike e-cars, batteries for an electric two-wheeler can generally be charged using a home wall socket, which takes eight to 10 hours for a full charge. The fast-charging alternative requires a small charging station and can charge a typical two-wheel EV battery within an hour.
Finally, there is the option of battery swapping, whereby users can switch the battery in their bike for a fully charged one. This is instantaneous and does not need any charging time, but battery swapping requires huge capital expenditure investment as the provider of such a service must store many fully charged batteries at multiple locations.

Be it slow charge, fast charge, or battery swap, another issue appears to be the lack of interoperability between various bike brands. There is currently no standardized battery swapping system or fast charging system that can be used across all electric two-wheel models. For now, e-bike manufacturers also need to provide the infrastructure to charge or swap their bike’s batteries.
There are differing levels of government support for EVs in Indonesia and Vietnam.
PLN, the Indonesian state-owned power company, plans to build 31,000 charging stations in the archipelago to address infrastructure gaps. However, in Vietnam, infrastructure for EVs is expected to be private sector-led with less government involvement.
In both countries, the question of interoperability between charging stations for two-wheel EVs has yet to be answered.
Companies launching a new e-bike brand must choose between designing bikes with a swappable battery or a fixed one. Next, the brand has to consider how to address infrastructure – should it build its own or find partners to co-develop it?
Emerging players such as Dat Bike are working to transform the electric two-wheeler landscape in Southeast Asia.
(Full disclosure: InnoVen Capital Southeast Asia is an investor in the startup).
Dat Bike is a leading contender capable of producing a vehicle that can match the performance of conventional, gasoline-powered motorcycles. Players like Dat Bike are addressing market voids and have an opportunity to catalyze the energy transition throughout the region.
Gear shift
Southeast Asia’s two-wheeler market presents a compelling opportunity for EV firms. The market is large and traditional manufacturers will likely be slow to convert to electric.
However, to succeed in driving mass adoption, electric two-wheeler brands must work to reduce the total cost of ownership by using efficient manufacturing or relying on government subsidies. Finally, a strategy around infrastructure and financing must be developed.
I’m confident that a new cohort of companies will emerge to address these issues and charge e-motorcycle adoption in the region.","With a huge market for motorbikes and governments keen to electrify transportation, the electric two-wheeler space is rife with opportunities.",Ben Cheah,Editing by Peter Cowan and Dhania Putri Sarahtika,open,2,,https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1712635463_hanoi-traffic.jpg,false,"",false,true,false,true,false,5,,1008,Why has motorcycle-mad SEA been slow to adopt two-wheel EVs?,"With a huge market for motorbikes and governments keen to electrify transportation, the electric two-wheeler space is rife with opportunities.",,,"","",""

Indian fintech giant Paytm has announced that Surinder Chawla, CEO and managing director its banking unit, will resign on June 26 for personal reasons. The move comes about a month after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) ordered Paytm Payments Bank to shut down operations.
Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma also quit the bank’s board in February. Sharma holds 51% of Paytm Payments Bank’s shares while the rest are held by Paytm parent company One 97 Communications.
Chawla’s resignation caps off a tumultuous start of the year for Paytm Payments Bank. RBI, India’s banking regulator, had mandated the winding down of bank by March 15 due to regulatory issues, causing a large drop in Paytm’s stock value.
Reuters also reported that Paytm Payments Bank was probed by the Enforcement Directorate, the government entity that looks into economic crimes and financial fraud.
Paytm’s shares plummeted nearly 50% after RBI’s directive. However, Paytm then terminated intercompany agreements with its affiliate bank in an effort to simplify its corporate structure.
The fintech firm has since won approval to become a third-party service provider on the country’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) infrastructure. That paved the way for Paytm to launch UPI services backed by prominent Indian banks like Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, State Bank of India, and Yes Bank.
Paytm had launched the payments bank in 2017, offering savings accounts, business banking, and other services.

Singapore’s Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) is in the throes of building a Southeast Asia-focused large language model. But the city-state’s literary circles worry that their copyrighted work might be used to train this model without consent, the Straits Times reported.
The IMDA has been working with local literary nonprofit firm Sing Lit Station to gather input in a survey, but writers say the research has a short timeframe and lacks clarity around compensation.
“If implemented without due consideration and safeguards, AI software will start assimilating material that would otherwise be copyrighted and adversely impact the livelihood of existing authors and publishers,” said Ng Kah Gay, editor at independent publisher Ethos Books.
These worries mirror those of the New York Times, which previously served a lawsuit to ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement. The publication claimed that millions of its articles were used to train AI models that are being used to compete with the major publisher.
OpenAI has since countersued, saying that the New York Times hacked into its systems to gain evidence.
Singapore’s Southeast Asia-focused LLM, called The National Multimodal LLM Program, intends to understand the city-state’s unique language traits and multilingual context. Along with Singapore’s Sea-lion model, IMDA said these efforts aim to address AI’s limitations on regional context and languages.
For now, the IMDA has extended the survey deadline from April 7 to April 15, and it will remain online indefinitely.

Cybersecurity startups, especially AI-powered ones, have seen a recent boost in interest. In Singapore, a startup specializing in “dark web intelligence” raised US$7 million just last month, while another was acquired by a US-listed firm.
Some cybersecurity firms are also setting their sights globally. One of them is Sprinto, a security and compliance firm based between India and the US.
The company recently raised US$20 million from Accel, Elevation Capital, and Blume Ventures in its series B funding round.
Sprinto CEO Girish Redekar said that the capital will fuel the firm’s R&amp;D efforts, particularly in AI and intelligent automation. The new funds will also enable the company to refine its core modules, splitting risk and compliance features into distinct products.
In a statement, Sprinto noted that companies have become more hesitant to do business without proper security and data privacy practices. This year, research and consulting firm Gartner expects global security and risk management spending to grow 14% compared to the previous year, propelled by increased adoption of cloud and AI tech as well as the continuation of hybrid work setups.
Founded in 2020, Sprinto automates information security compliance and privacy laws, mainly for SaaS companies. It also runs the Sprinto Ignite program, which helps startups get access to its compliance platform.

EVs’ crucial role in Vietnam’s story is why we’re shining the spotlight on the sector in our upcoming Saigon Summit.
Ahead of the event, we spoke with Son Nguyen, founder and CEO of Dat Bike, an electric motorcycle manufacturer in the country, about his entrepreneurial story and why he’s excited for Vietnam’s EV scene.
The following interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. 
How did you become a founder?
When I was living in the US, amid the clamor of opportunity, I stumbled upon a realization that there was a quiet but strong yearning for electric mobility echoing from the streets of Vietnam.
Having kept an eye on market demand and believing in the power of available technology in the US to address Vietnam’s challenges, I launched Dat Bike to steer the country toward a greener horizon.
Why are you excited about Vietnam’s EV scene?
Vietnam’s EV scene represents a highly promising market with substantial demand. Electric vehicles are gaining popularity rapidly for several reasons:

The country has the largest electric two-wheeler market in Southeast Asia as well as the highest annual growth rate – 80% of two-wheeled EVs produced in Southeast Asia are for the Vietnamese market. This presents immense opportunities for innovation and expansion within the industry.
With access to rare earth metals such as nickel and lithium, which are crucial components for battery production, Vietnam holds a strategic advantage in the global EV supply chain.
The country possesses an established manufacturing ecosystem specifically tailored to two-wheelers. Leveraging this infrastructure, Vietnam is well-positioned to scale up production and meet the growing demand for EVs domestically and regionally.

What is one thing you wish people knew about Vietnam?
As shared earlier, Vietnam is the second-largest two-wheeler market in Southeast Asia and the largest market for electric two-wheelers, with a growth rate of 30%. The Vietnamese government has made a committed push toward electric two-wheeler adoption as part of its goal to achieve net zero by 2050.
With a clear commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship, the widespread adoption of EVs in Vietnam is not just promising but inevitable. This presents a unique and exciting opportunity for investors and innovators alike to contribute to Vietnam’s journey toward a greener and more sustainable future.

What is the most important lesson you’ve learned since becoming a founder?
Never wait for perfection. “Done is better than perfect” has become a mantra for me.
In the entrepreneurial journey, mistakes are inevitable, but what matters most is the ability to recognize errors quickly, make amends, and sprint toward our goals.
What advice do you want to give to aspiring entrepreneurs?
Believe wholeheartedly in the value you bring to people, and steadfastly follow your unique path. Founders need to trust in their vision and the impact it can have on others. Embrace your strengths, stay true to your values, and dare to innovate fearlessly.
Remember, the world needs your perspective, your passion, and your perseverance. Let your belief in your value guide you to success.
What will you be speaking about at Tech in Asia’s Saigon Summit and why is it important?
I’ll be discussing Dat Bike’s unique approach to product development, focusing on achieving the best ratio between performance and price. This discussion is vital because it showcases our model for building products that resonate with consumers while maintaining competitiveness in the market.
Additionally, I’ll delve into our company vision and our commitment to sustainability and innovation in the electric vehicle industry. I aim to inspire and inform fellow entrepreneurs, highlighting the importance of striking a balance between performance, affordability, and a sustainable vision for the future.

Hear more from Son, as well as a host of other exciting speakers, at Tech in Asia’s upcoming Saigon Summit. Held on May 30 at GEM Center, Ho Chi Minh City, we’re bringing together some of Southeast Asia’s best and brightest to chart Vietnam’s tech future together.

The Jakarta-based company posted US$15 million in net revenue during the period, according to filings with Singapore’s Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA). Besides peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, KoinWorks also offers financial services such as banking, supply chain financing, invoice factoring, and business-to-business buy now, pay later.
Nathan Yoles, chief marketing officer (CMO) at KoinWorks, attributed the revenue increase to higher income from its loan operations. He explained to Tech in Asia that KoinWorks generates revenue through two key channels: fees paid by borrowers and lenders for facilitating transactions and interest income earned from lending services on the platform.

In 2022, KoinWorks’ disbursed loans jumped by 108% while its outstanding loans also rose by 34%. Its product offerings beyond P2P lending also contributed to the increase, Yoles says.
Founded in 2016 by Benedicto Haryono and Willy Arifin, KoinWorks expects to book a net profit by the end of 2024. However, the company did not elaborate on whether it expects to be profitable for the whole of 2024 or by the final quarter of the year.
Heavy investing in 2022
KoinWorks registered losses of US$23.5 million in 2022, up from US$3.65 million in the previous year. The company says this was due to “high investment for automation and product development” throughout the year.
In January 2022, KoinWorks secured US$108 million via a series C round, bringing its total disclosed funding to US$168 million.
The company acquired rural bank BPR Asri Cikupa in September 2022 and later rebranded it to KoinWorks Bank. At the time, the firm stated that the acquisition was aimed at supporting the “long-term development of KoinWorks’ business” and expanding its financing coverage.
That same year, the company built transactional banking infrastructure to digitize some processes while also injecting capital into KoinWorks Bank.

Fueled by product development and other improvements, KoinWorks’ general and administrative expenses soared by 220%. On the other hand, its finance costs also shot up by 87%, increasing along with the surge in disbursed loans.
“From 2022 onwards, KoinWorks became more focused on reducing its cost of finance by getting funds via time deposits offered by KoinWorks Bank,” Yoles says.
The company made several moves to slash expenses in 2022, including laying off 70 employees or about 8% of its workforce and discontinuing its education student loan service, KoinPintar.

By the end of 2022, the company’s cash and cash equivalents amounted to US$10 million, with assets shrinking by 27% and liabilities growing by 19%. Nonetheless, Yoles believes that by 2023, KoinWorks’ cost efficiency was “already visible” enough to support its plans to be profitable this year.
Path to profitability
The fintech firm declined to share specific numbers for 2023. While its financials are still in the red on the group level, the company says that its P2P lending business and KoinWorks Bank have achieved profitability.
KoinWorks Bank reported its first profitable month in January 2024, over a year after its launch. Its core offering is based on secured loans offering “competitive rates,” according to Yoles.
“The non-performing loans (NPL) are currently operating at very sustainable levels, registering 0.5% since its inception,” the CMO adds. This figure is better than the banking NPL rate in Indonesia, which stood at 0.79% as of January 2024.
KoinWorks Bank currently operates as a conventional bank, but the company plans to transform it into a digital bank by 2025. This change will allow KoinWorks users, especially MSMEs, to open digital savings accounts with the bank.

Meanwhile, the company claims that its P2P lending services recorded a “full-year profit” in 2023, and it expects profit levels to continue climbing. KoinWorks booked a loan disbursement of 10 trillion rupiah (US$629 million) in the same year.
This amount has exceeded the figure for 2022, and there are indications of an even larger disbursement this year. The company has disbursed more than US$119 million in loans as of February, putting it on pace to exceed US$700 million for 2024.
However, KoinWorks’ challenge might be to boost the 90-day repayment success rate (TKB90) for its main business, P2P lending. Its TKB90 stands at 93% as of February, indicating that 7% of loans are unpaid after 90 days past their due date.
This percentage is still below the average of 97.05%, based on January data from Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (OJK), Indonesia’s financial services regulator.
KoinWorks’ TKB90 is also lower compared to its peers including Modalku (97.22%), Amartha (98.24%), and Akseleran (99.75%).

KoinWorks will continue to improve its TKB by “minimizing risks through strategic partnerships with key distributors in the country,” co-founder and executive chairman Willy Arifin tells Tech in Asia. Doing so would allow KoinWorks to view the transaction data and assess the repayment ability of potential borrowers.
Indeed, KoinWorks has teamed up with several companies to distribute loans in the past year including aquatech unicorn eFishery, FMCG company Indonesia Distribution Hub, telco player Smartfren, and manufacturing solutions firm Wifkain.
Although its disbursed loans continue to rise each year, KoinWorks has to improve its TKB to build and maintain the trust of investors, lenders, and other stakeholders.
This is even more important amid the recent troubles faced by several lending fintech players in Indonesia.

After six years since the start of its global expansion, ride-hailing giant Ola is ending services in the UK, Australia, and New Zealand, aiming to focus more on India’s expanding market, TechCrunch reported.
According to the the report, a spokesperson said the Bangalore-headquartered company sees vast opportunities for expansion within its home country and has shifted its priorities accordingly.
In an email sent out to customers in Australia, Ola announced that it is “discontinuing operations” from April 12.
Notably, Ola Electric – the firm’s electric vehicle arm – is gearing up for an IPO in India in 2024 after postponing it last year. The company also plans to launch an electric rickshaw before its public listing.
Documents submitted towards the end of 2023 suggest that Ola Electric is aiming to secure US$662 million through the IPO.
Ola recently shifted its focus to e-scooters and has ventured into AI with Krutrim AI, a new entity that has already launched a foundational model.
The company was valued at US$7.3 billion in 2021, but it was slashed by US-based investor Vanguard in February. After that, Ola’s valuation hovered at US$1.9 billion.
Apart from e-scooters and e-rickshaws, Ola Electric is also developing electric cars and motorcycles, which are expected to hit the markets by the end of this year.

South Korea’s President Yoon Suk Yeol has announced that the country is targeting to spend 9.4 trillion won (US$6.94 billion) on AI by 2027, aiming to boost local semiconductor production, Reuters reported.
The government plans to boost research and development related to AI chips, a key part of its export-led economy. The focus is on next-generation artificial neural processing units – specialized chips for machine learning applications – and high-bandwidth memory chips.
Semiconductors comprised about one-fifth of the country’s total exports in March, hitting a 21-month peak of US$11.7 billion.
South Korea also aims to encourage advancements in artificial general intelligence, a type of AI that has a level of thinking comparable to humans.
The new strategy includes a US$1 billion fund earmarked entirely to help AI semiconductor companies.
As the world doubles down on AI, other governments like India and Vietnam are also betting big on semiconductors, introducing policies favorable for chip manufacturers to set up local plants.
For instance, India’s first semiconductor fab, a joint venture between local firms Tata and PSMC, is set to begin production in 2026.
The US, China, and Japan are all investing heavily to bolster their semiconductor supplies as well. Separately, Samsung reportedly received over US$6 billion in subsidies from the US to help the South Korean chip leader increase its production in the states.

Hi there,
A few weeks earlier, I received a message from my internet service provider about a temporary disconnection issue due to a cable line getting severed. It made me realize that in a world that has become wireless and cloud-based, everything still depends on physical hardware.
You have Wi-Fi only because there are networks of deep-sea fiber cables connecting everyone.
There are parallels here to AI. While everyone marvels at the capabilities of foundational models by OpenAI, Google, and Meta, I find it fascinating how humans are able to create hardware that cram so much processing power into a small chip. These AI chips are the reason why foundational models are able to generate anything you need quickly.
In our first Big Story, my colleague Lokesh maps out the AI chip and hardware makers in Southeast Asia providing the graphic processing units to power the generative AI race. With the region already being a semiconductor hub, it has all the necessary ingredients for the manufacturing of AI hardware to grow.
Top chipmaker Nvidia is looking to set up in Vietnam, and its founder and CEO Jensen Huang recently said that Malaysia can become an AI hub in the region. Currently, many of Southeast Asia’s AI chips and components manufacturers are based in Singapore.
Speaking of the city-state, in our second Big Story, my colleague Scott spotlights a cryptoless blockchain company called Stability Protocol that is working with Singapore’s Infocomm Media Development Authority to digitalize the document system in its ports.
It has gone back to blockchain’s roots to develop a network that doesn’t use cryptocurrencies. This is giving it inroads even into China – a market that has banned crypto.
Coming back to genAI, in this week’s AI Odyssey, I explore how the technology has been weaponized by militaries across the world to seek and destroy.
But first, the Big Stories!

AI ODYSSEY
Promising AI projects we’re noticing
The bodies pile up as AI takes to the battlefield
After ChatGPT 3.5 launched nearly a year and a half ago, all I have seen every day since is how generative AI is going to change the world. And it is definitely changing the world, for better and for worse.
AI today has reduced the time and cost to generate content, solve problems, and even code apps and platforms.
But as days pass, we also get to see the grim side of genAI, such as how it is being used to fight on the battlefield. If you think this is science fiction talk, it is not.
Last week, an exposé by The Guardian revealed that the Israeli army has used an AI system to identify 37,000 people, who the AI linked with Hamas, as targets.

The AI platform used by Israel’s intelligence service is called Lavender, and it is actively being used in its ongoing war in Gaza, Palestine. Once the AI has identified a person as a Hamas operative, a human can then give the green light for drones to execute them.
This was all done through the use of an algorithm with an error rate of 10%. This was enough for the army to justify the bombing of the AI-suggested targets in Gaza.
It’s no wonder why the number of civilian deaths during this war is so high.
Militaries usually acquire intel from sources, which are then verified with multiple on-ground sources and troop reports, before getting the nod for a strike. But here, Israeli intelligence officers using Lavender said they would “invest 20 seconds for each target” identified by the AI system.
The Israel-Palestine war isn’t the only battlefield where AI is being deployed, either. The ongoing, two-year-old war between Ukraine and Russia is also being used as a playground to test the tech.
Currently, the Ukraine army is using AI to monitor enemy movements, autonomous payload delivery, and unpiloted drone strikes. It is also using insights from the tech for strategic decision-making.
Meanwhile, the world’s two largest militaries – the US and China – have been working to boost their own AI capabilities.
For instance, the US used AI to find targets in Yemen, Iraq, and Syria. The US military reportedly has over 800 active AI projects.
At the same time, the People’s Liberation Army has created a network of unmanned weapons and undersea sensors in the sea surrounding China and is using AI to process information from this network.
The US and China each have one of the largest defense budgets in the world. The aggressive pursuit of AI in their defense plans will likely spur other military powers across the world to do the same.
If you want a glimpse into how inhumane and cold-blooded wars in the future will become, just hear what one Israeli intelligence officer had to say: “I had zero added-value as a human, apart from being a stamp of approval. It saved a lot of time.”
The accelerated use of AI to make killing other humans more efficient seems straight out of a science fiction movie. Do we really need to speed up our own destruction by building intelligent killing machines? Or am I missing something here?
With AI so close to the trigger button, what will keep a “highly intelligent” entity from removing humans from the equation to make it even more efficient?

Singapore startup Peptobiotics has raised US$6.2 million in series A funding. The new capital will help the firm take its antibiotic alternative for the farming and aquaculture sector to market.
Peptobiotics co-founder and CEO Jonathan Bester said the series A raise gives the company the working capital “to produce larger commercial volumes” of its product to cut antibiotics out of the food supply chain.
Founded in 2020, the company aims to combat the farming and aquaculture space’s overreliance on antibiotics, which opens the door for bacteria to be more resistant.
This is especially concerning in the US, where roughly 80% of antibiotics are used in animals, the company said.
Peptobiotics’s solution uses recombinant antimicrobial peptides, which are naturally occurring bacteria-inhibiting proteins.
“Our focus at Peptobiotics is to use biotech to create a real agricultural antibiotic alternative that is effective for farmers, clean for nature, humane for animals, and safe for consumers,” said Bester.
Hatch Blue, an aquaculture-focused enterprise, led the oversubscribed round. Other participants included Singapore’s Seeds Capital, France’s Seventure Partners, Australia’s GrainCorp Ventures, and Farmabase, a Latin American animal healthcare company.

In today’s generative AI race, one proverb stands out: “During a gold rush, sell shovels.”
While companies like OpenAI, Google, Meta, Baidu, and several others are mining gold, AI chipmaker Nvidia is the leading shovel seller.
The US$2.1 trillion chipmaker recently unveiled the world’s most powerful AI chip that can perform tasks 30x faster than its predecessor. This is expected to give the company a stranglehold over the market and has even pushed other chip manufacturers – Intel, Qualcomm, and Google – to form a coalition to take on Nvidia.
Before Covid-19, most of the AI chips and semiconductors were manufactured in Taiwan. But the US-China trade war, pandemic-induced demand and supply fluctuations, and the US government’s Chips Act have triggered an unprecedented upheaval within the global semiconductor industry.
With the Chips Act, the US government plans to increase chip manufacturing in the country, while banning the exports of particular hardware to nations like China. The US is also trying to reduce its reliance on Taiwan in chip manufacturing.
This led to the “China plus one” and “Taiwan plus one” production strategies, which involve companies setting up manufacturing facilities outside of the two countries to reduce their reliance on these regions.
Many are now eyeing Southeast Asia as a place to manufacture AI chips and semiconductors.
Last December, Nvidia’s founder and CEO, Jensen Huang, said that Malaysia could become a hub for AI manufacturing in Southeast Asia as the need for AI data centers grows. A supplier of Nvidia, Taiwan-based Kinsus Interconnect Technology, is also setting up a pilot manufacturing plant in the country.
With this in mind, Tech in Asia created a list of companies in Southeast Asia that are directly or indirectly involved in the production of AI chips and associated hardware.

Tech in Asia’s data shows that a majority of these firms operating in the region work in verticals that support AI chip production – from assembly and testing to distribution.
For instance, Singapore-based Plunify is an IT company that uses machine learning, data analytics, and cloud computing to help with semiconductor chip design. Meanwhile, NexGen Wafer Systems, another Singapore-based business, manufactures and services semiconductor processing equipment.
Of the 37 companies active in the region, only six of them manufacture chips.

One of the largest firms operating in the assembly and testing segment is Kulicke &amp; Soffa. Founded in 1951 in Singapore, the company designs, manufactures, and sells semiconductor packaging and electronic assembly solutions.
Singapore’s strategic location, strong government support, established ecosystem, and focus on high-value activities has made the city-state an attractive destination for these businesses.
As a result, Singapore accounts for approximately 11% of the global semiconductor market share, and about one-fifth of global semiconductor equipment is manufactured in the country.
Most of the companies based in Southeast Asia cater to customers largely from the region, with Singapore and Malaysia being the largest customer bases.
The biggest client base outside of the region for these firms is China, with 11 companies having some customers in the country. This was followed by the US and India.
NexGen Wafer Systems and Malaysia’s Onn Wah Tech are two examples of those who have clients outside of Southeast Asia.

The firms on the list also have operations in Europe. Singapore-based chiplet maker Silicon Box, for instance, recently announced plans to invest US$3.5 billion in a new chip plant and test facility in northern Italy
That said, global AI chipmakers are also operating in Southeast Asia, with six players having a footprint in the region.

Vietnam is one of the most attractive destinations for AI chips in Southeast Asia, with Nvidia being the latest to voice its intentions to set up a base in the nation. The company has also co-invested US$200 million in Indonesia for an AI center.
Vietnam’s abundant raw materials like silica sand, its strategic location, low labor costs, and strong export infrastructure are a few of the reasons why it is an ideal location for global companies to set up a plant.
While many businesses like Nvidia, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), and Samsung want to begin manufacturing in Southeast Asian countries, industry data shows that it typically takes anywhere from five to 10 years to build an AI chip and semiconductor fabrication plant and start mass production.
Still, some companies have initiated operations in the region. Among these are Intel, Synopsys, and Amkor Technologies, which are currently prioritizing chip assembly and testing.
Tech in Asia couldn’t identify all the investors backing chip companies operating in the region, but some notable investors include Singapore state-backed entities such as Temasek, the National University of Singapore, and EDBI, which is the investment arm of Singapore’s Economic Development Board.

EDBI has invested in two Singapore players: Systems on Silicon Manufacturing Company (SSMC) and CompoundTek. It’s worth noting that SSMC is a joint venture between two of the largest semiconductor firms in the world, NXP Semiconductors and TSMC. Intel recently invested in Silicon Box as well.
Other noteworthy investors in the firms on this list include Airbus Ventures, BlackRock, and Vanguard.
We hope that as we constantly update our database, this will be a useful reference for anyone who’s interested in Southeast Asia’s chip manufacturing space.
We acknowledge that we’re missing some data, so do reach out to lokesh.choudhary@techinasia.com to help us fill in the gaps.
Here are some caveats about the data:

Only companies who are working directly or indirectly in the production of AI chips have been included.
The list is of firms based out of Southeast Asia and global brands operating in the region.
It includes businesses that have already set up operations and excludes companies that have just announced plans to set up a manufacturing plant.

For instance, Singapore-based Plunify is an IT company that uses machine learning, data analytics, and cloud computing to help with semiconductor chip design. Meanwhile, NexGen Wafer Systems, another Singapore-based business, manufactures and services semiconductor processing equipment.
Of the 37 companies active in the region, only six of them manufacture chips.

One of the largest firms operating in the assembly and testing segment is Kulicke &amp; Soffa. Founded in 1951 in Singapore, the company designs, manufactures, and sells semiconductor packaging and electronic assembly solutions.
Singapore’s strategic location, strong government support, established ecosystem, and focus on high-value activities has made the city-state an attractive destination for these businesses.
As a result, Singapore accounts for approximately 11% of the global semiconductor market share, and about one-fifth of global semiconductor equipment is manufactured in the country.
Most of the companies based in Southeast Asia cater to customers largely from the region, with Singapore and Malaysia being the largest customer bases.
The biggest client base outside of the region for these firms is China, with 11 companies having some customers in the country. This was followed by the US and India.
NexGen Wafer Systems and Malaysia’s Onn Wah Tech are two examples of those who have clients outside of Southeast Asia.

The firms on the list also have operations in Europe. Singapore-based chiplet maker Silicon Box, for instance, recently announced plans to invest US$3.5 billion in a new chip plant and test facility in northern Italy
That said, global AI chipmakers are also operating in Southeast Asia, with six players having a footprint in the region.

Vietnam is one of the most attractive destinations for AI chips in Southeast Asia, with Nvidia being the latest to voice its intentions to set up a base in the nation. The company has also co-invested US$200 million in Indonesia for an AI center.
Vietnam’s abundant raw materials like silica sand, its strategic location, low labor costs, and strong export infrastructure are a few of the reasons why it is an ideal location for global companies to set up a plant.
While many businesses like Nvidia, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), and Samsung want to begin manufacturing in Southeast Asian countries, industry data shows that it typically takes anywhere from five to 10 years to build an AI chip and semiconductor fabrication plant and start mass production.
Still, some companies have initiated operations in the region. Among these are Intel, Synopsys, and Amkor Technologies, which are currently prioritizing chip assembly and testing.
Tech in Asia couldn’t identify all the investors backing chip companies operating in the region, but some notable investors include Singapore state-backed entities such as Temasek, the National University of Singapore, and EDBI, which is the investment arm of Singapore’s Economic Development Board.

EDBI has invested in two Singapore players: Systems on Silicon Manufacturing Company (SSMC) and CompoundTek. It’s worth noting that SSMC is a joint venture between two of the largest semiconductor firms in the world, NXP Semiconductors and TSMC. Intel recently invested in Silicon Box as well.
Other noteworthy investors in the firms on this list include Airbus Ventures, BlackRock, and Vanguard.
We hope that as we constantly update our database, this will be a useful reference for anyone who’s interested in Southeast Asia’s chip manufacturing space.
We acknowledge that we’re missing some data, so do reach out to lokesh.choudhary@techinasia.com to help us fill in the gaps.
Here are some caveats about the data:

Only companies who are working directly or indirectly in the production of AI chips have been included.
The list is of firms based out of Southeast Asia and global brands operating in the region.
It includes businesses that have already set up operations and excludes companies that have just announced plans to set up a manufacturing plant.

Supported by a US$6.6 billion federal grant, chipmaking giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) is planning to boost its US investment by over 60%, driving up its total to exceed US$65 billion, Nikkei Asia reported.
This marks the largest foreign direct investment (FDI) in the US for a greenfield project, the report said, citing US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo. Bolstered by the added funds, the US would be on pace to make around 20% of the world’s top-tier chips by 2030.
The Taiwan-based company is building three facilities in the US. Located in Arizona, TSMC’s inaugural plant is expected to churn out 4-nanometer chips and will start making them in 2025.
The second plant, initially designated to manufacture 3-nanometer chips, will now also accommodate the production of 2-nanometer chips. Production at this facility is scheduled to commence by 2028.
A third plant is also in the works. Estimated to be functional by 2030, it will produce more advanced 2-nanometer chips.
Despite these plans, issues like labor shortages and lengthy approval periods for permits have delayed the first factory’s production by a year. To address these problems, TSMC is considering importing Taiwanese talent.
TSMC is the biggest contract chip manufacturer globally and supplies to major chip developers such as Apple, Nvidia, Qualcomm, and Amazon. As tech firms race to catch generative AI wave, TSMC said its revenue could surge by 26%.
The company also announced in January that its net revenue grew by 14.4% quarter over quarter to US$19.6 billion in Q4, fueled by recent advancements in semiconductor tech. However, its overall 2023 revenue is still down 8.7% year on year at US$69.3 billion.

Byju’s-owned Aakash Educational Services Limited (AESL) has named Deepak Mehrotra as its managing director (MD) and CEO.
This aligns with AESL’s aim to improve and widen its operations. The appointment will enable AESL to leverage Mehrotra’s business expertise from his time as MD at Pearson India.
Mehrotra has over 30 years of experience across multiple sectors including fast-moving consumer goods, telecom, and education. He has also held key roles in companies like Ashirvad Pipes, Bharti Airtel, Coca-Cola, and Asian Paints.
“In his role as CEO, he will be responsible to deliver on our aggressive growth plan and to build on the significant momentum the company is currently experiencing,” said Byju Raveendran, founder and chairman of Byju’s.
The appointment comes close on the heels of Byju’s and AESL withdrawing their merger petition in March on matters related to governance issues and share-swap arrangements. The former had acquired AESL for US$940 million in 2021.
Byju’s itself is facing financial challenges and is entangled in a legal dispute with its investors, some of whom are pushing for the removal of Raveendran from his leadership role in the company.
The firm’s US division also filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, as the unit – Byju’s Alpha – defaulted on US$1.2 billion in debt.

Amit Saberwal, founder and CEO of RedDoorz / Photo credit: RedDoorz

Singapore-based RedDoorz has secured US$28.2 million from returning investors Asia Partners and Mirae Asset Venture Investment, among others, according to Alternatives.pe, which tracks regulatory filings in the city-state.
The hospitality firm did not confirm the raise in a comment, but founder and CEO Amit Saberwal told Tech in Asia that as a series C company, “our internal investors supported us through Covid till where we are today – achieving group cash flow positive.” The milestone, Saberwal shared in an email, was attained at the group level in the fourth quarter of last year.
Without giving specific figures, Saberwal added that being cash flow positive props RedDoorz up for profitability and self-sufficiency in 2024.
“We have worked on all aspects of business to achieve this – continuous supply growth through our multibrand portfolio, focusing on improving unit economics and OpEx (operating expenses) optimization,” said the CEO.
This follows the Asia Partners-backed firm breaking even in Indonesia and the Philippines – two markets that contribute 95% to its business – in the fourth quarter of 2022.
However, at that time, the company also reduced its properties in Vietnam by 37% due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.
In February last year, Saberwal told Tech in Asia that he wanted to avoid overhiring, “which would inevitably lead to mass firing like the recent tech layoffs.” By April, however, the firm had laid off 90 employees in its non-core markets.
According to Tech in Asia data, RedDoorz has previously raised over US$134 million, with past investors including International Finance Corporation, Jungle Ventures, MNC Media, and 500 Global.
Besides operating hotels, the company also generates revenue by offering micro products such as early check-in or late check-out, paid loyalty programs, insurance, flexible cancelation policies, and breakfast.
RedDoorz, which plans to expand into Malaysia, follows a multibranding strategy. Its brands include Sans, Urban View, Sunnera, and Lavana.

VC funding in India saw a drastic decline in 2023, plummeting by 72% to US$7 billion from the previous year’s US$25 billion.
But signs of revival are emerging, with VC firms such as Orient Growth Ventures and Cactus Venture Partners closing new funds.
In line with this, India-based Filter Capital has finalized its debut fund, called the Filter Capital India Fund I, after ecuring a corpus of 8 billion rupees (US$96 million).
Backers of the new investment vehicle include HDFC Fund of Funds, the Small Industries Development Bank of India, and SRI Fund, as well as individuals like Amansa Capital founder Akash Prakash and Dream11 CEO Harsh Jain.
Filter Capital is eyeing investments in SaaS and tech services firms expanding globally from India, notably those in series B and series C stages. The fund will also back companies in the consumer, financial, and business services sectors.
The VC firm was founded by former Warburg Pincus executives Nitin Nayar and Sumit Sinha, each with almost 20 years of private equity investment experience focusing on tech businesses in India.
“Through our capital, networks, and expertise, we can help our portfolio companies scale and build enduring businesses,” said Sinha in a statement.
So far, the fund has allocated more than 30% of its corpus to four ventures: SaaS loyalty startup Capillary Technologies, transportation firm Chalo Mobility, logistics service provider LoadShare Networks, and healthcare-focused data analytics platform THB.

Hello reader,
It seems like around this time of year, many people I know get infected with the “I must go to Japan!” virus – myself included last year, by the way. Already, my Instagram stories are being filled with photos and videos of Tokyo, Kyoto, and other major tourist destinations.
Having been there three times, I do agree that Japan is always worth a visit, especially because it’s one of the few places where I can recall the culture having such a big presence. If you’re into new experiences and fantastic food, then a trip to Japan could be worth your while.
The funny thing is, if you asked many people – especially Singaporeans – what they think about Japan, the first thing they’d probably mention is travel-related. That, or anime.
If you went to ask startup founders at a networking event the same question, they’d probably answer along those lines too (don’t quote me on this), instead of talking about the country’s startups. It wouldn’t be surprising either, given that Japan’s tech scene is somewhat lagging behind the rest of the world.
So why aren’t Japanese startups living up to the performance of the country’s other superstar industries like manufacturing? Today’s premium story takes a look at some reasons and how those issues can be resolved.
Today we look at:

Why Japanese startups aren’t living up to their full potential 
Southeast Asia’s latest funding numbers
Other newsy highlights such as Tesla eyeing a new EV plant in India and Nvidia partnering with an Indonesian telco


Premium summary
Leaving the nest

To illustrate just how far Japanese startups are lagging behind, here’s a stat: As of 2021, startups in Tokyo raised 16x less funding per capita compared to their counterparts in Berlin, even though the Japanese and German economies are of similar size. Let’s take a look at how this came to be.


Getting comfortable: The country’s domestic market is large and wealthy, which gives startups access to a lot of consumers with high purchasing power. With such a steady supply of potential users, it often doesn’t make sense for them to expand internationally. 

Comfort in baby steps: Another reason is that local startups can list early on the “Mothers” section of Japan’s stock market. Exiting at an earlier stage could mean that founders no longer have global ambitions, as they’ve already “won” in some sense. 

A dash of foreign talent: One way to solve these issues is to add more foreign talent into the Japanese ecosystem. That said, it won’t be easy given how homogenous the society is, making it difficult for foreigners to integrate into.

News spotlight
Still in the doldrums

It’s not great news for Southeast Asia’s startups this year, as recent data shows that funding is still trending downward. Hang in there everyone!


Numbers aren’t … great: According to Tech in Asia data, Southeast Asian startups collectively raised US$1.2 billion in the first quarter of 2024, which is a 29% year-on-year drop and 82.6% lower than Q1 2022. 

Two steps forward, one step back: While the number of deals in Q1 2024 increased compared to the previous quarter – from 144 to 182 – overall funding was still lower. Q4 2023 saw a total of US$4 billion in deals.  

Petering out: Much of this decline was due to a decrease in later-stage funding rounds, which usually have higher investment amounts than early-stage fundraises.

Photo credit: Allies of Skin LinkedIn page

Singapore-based beauty brand Allies of Skin is set to expand into the US after raising a US$20 million funding round from Meaningful Partners.
This follows the company hitting positive EBITA in 2023, its founder Nicolas Travis told Tech in Asia. Allies of Skin, founded in 2016, said the round is its first institutional raise, but it has received private investments in the past – including capital from Crazy Rich Asians star Henry Golding.
The US currently has the largest beauty and personal care market worldwide, with the industry expected to generate US$130 billion in revenue by 2030 from the country alone.
Numerous Singaporean brands like Skin Inc and Re:erth have extended their reach to capture their share of the market. On a volume basis, over 65% of Skin Inc’s products, including those in beauty boxes, are sold in the US.
While Allies of Skin hit EBITA profitability last year, “as we work on scaling on the US via paid media and influencers, we will see that being affected,” noted Travis. However, the company said that it has a “solid plan” to build a financially sustainable business.
The firm added that its expansion in the US will be carried out through listings on digital and retail platforms in the country.
Allies of Skin offers products that use clinically proven ingredients such as retinoids, vitamin C, acids, and antioxidants. It sells a range of offerings including moisturizers, serums, cleansers, toners, and face oils.
Travis said Allies of Skin has already sold eight-figures worth of products in the US and has a strong product lineup ready for the Western market.
Allies of Skin is available in 36 countries, with its products being carried by 40 retail partners, including Space NK, Mecca, Sephora, and Cult Beauty.

Hello reader,
I don’t know if it’s the same for you, but I rely on startups for my daily needs, including groceries, medications, investments, payments, and transportation. There is hardly a day when I do not place an online order, book a ride via an app, or use a QR code for payment.
I live in India, and the startup ecosystem here is booming. But my opinion may be biased since I live in Bengaluru, the startup hub of the country.
However, this surge is not confined solely to India’s biggest cities. It’s now extending to Tier 2 and Tier 3 towns.
Many want in on the action. Startups who had once set up their parent entities abroad to attract foreign investors are now scrambling to return to their home country.
More than half a dozen Indian startups are making a beeline to return to India, even as the process entails a heavy tax burden. In this week’s Big Story, I delve into this trend of reverse flipping and explore the factors driving it.

THE BIG STORY

Why are Indian startups ready to pay big for ‘reverse flip’?
Driven by favorable market conditions and homeground advantage, Indian startups are returning to their native country to set up their base.

3 Trends to keep an eye on
Hot stocks, earnings reports, restructuring, pressure from activist investors, and more.

1️⃣ All AI roads lead to Singapore?: Singapore is rapidly positioning itself as an AI hub, and it’s got the endorsement of ByteDance.
The Chinese tech major has listed more than 40 job openings related to generative AI, primarily located in the city-state.
Singapore has already revealed a new US$742 million investment into the industry, which will take place over the next five years.
But OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft (MSFT, NDAQ), chose Japan as its first AI office location, so it will be interesting to see where the trajectory of this Asian AI boom is headed.
2️⃣ Revival of pay later?: Even as companies such as ShopBack and Atome have rolled back their buy now, pay later offerings, another set of players are signaling a resurgence of BNPL activities.
Grab (GRAB, NDAQ) has announced that it will cease support for its GrabPay Card, as it has “observed much higher adoption and use of other Grab offerings” including PayLater by Grab.
Meanwhile, Indonesia’s GoTo (GOTO, IDX) is planning to launch a BNPL product with TikTok soon. Why are the fortunes of different pay-later firms diverging?
Perhaps, success lies in integrating BNPL as an add-on service with incentives to users who are already big spenders on a large platform.
3️⃣ Thailand’s electrifying space: Vietnamese EV maker VinFast (VFS, NDAQ) has signed agreements with 15 auto dealers in Thailand.
VinFast founder and billionaire Pham Nhat Vuong’s bet on the country seems to be the right move, as Thailand accounts for 58% of the total number of electric vehicles sold in Southeast Asia.
EV is definitely a big trend to watch out for in the region: VinFast has announced a US$404 million investment in EV charging stations in Vietnam, and Singapore is pushing for 100% cleaner energy vehicles by 2040.

2 Eye-popping facts

US$2 billion: The profit that IPO-bound Shein posted for 2023, which was an over 2x rise from the previous year.


18 million: The amount of “bad content” Meta (META, NDAQ) took down from Facebook and Instagram in India for March.



The one you didn’t see coming
We spotlight the story that had everyone talking and social media buzzing during the past week.

Shot in the arm for EVs in India: The Indian government gave the green light on a much awaited EV policy, which is likely to attract top global manufacturers to the country.
The policy entails lower import taxes on select EVs for companies committing to investments of over US$500 million and setting up manufacturing hubs in the country within three years.
This development provides a boost for Tesla (TSLA, NDAQ), which has been eyeing entry into India’s EV market.
Elon Musk met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New York last year. The Tesla founder expressed admiration and stated that he was “extremely enthusiastic about India’s future.”
The company is scouting for a location to house a US$2 billion to US$3 billion plant in the country.
This could be seen as a favorable development for the government, particularly with the general elections beginning this month.

At 89%, Japan has one of the highest website cart abandonment rates worldwide for merchants. This is much higher than the global average of 70%.
To help boost sales, local fintech firm Smartpay began offering buy now, pay later services in 2021. According to the company, Smartpay users have an average order value of US$240, which is over 40% higher than non-users.
Now, the company has raised US$7 million in a pre-series A funding round led by SMBC Venture Capital and joined by Angel Bridge, Matrix Partners, and Global Founders Capital.
Founded by Sam Pemberton Ahmed in 2020, Smartpay’s other services include a digital in-store payments service with free automated installments – which it said is the first in Japan – as well as Smartpay Bank Direct, which enables users to make online purchases from their bank accounts.
The company plans to grow its customer base to 2 million and merchant network to 30,000 within the next three years.
The new fundraise comes amid tough times for Asia’s BNPL industry, which have seen several closures in recent months. These include Bukalapak’s BukaCicilan offering, ShopBack’s PayLater service, and Atome’s exit from Vietnam.
Despite these woes, Indonesian tech major GoTo Group recently announced that it will soon roll out a BNPL service with TikTok as part of its efforts to drive top-line growth.

843685,2024-04-08T05:00:02,2024-04-08T10:51:51,Cutting out crypto: Web3 firm looks to bring blockchain back to its roots,cutting-crypto-web3-firm-looks-bring-blockchain-roots,publish,post,https://www.techinasia.com/cutting-crypto-web3-firm-looks-bring-blockchain-roots,"There was a time when the tech industry saw blockchain technology – not cryptocurrencies – as the foundation of a new multibillion-dollar industry.
Stability Protocol, a Los Angeles-based firm founded in 2022, thinks that time has arrived again. Last month, the company – formed by CEO Juliun Brabon, COO Klay Nichol, and CPO Mike Mathis – launched Stability’s mainnet: a cryptoless, feeless blockchain called the Global Trust Network.

A blockchain that eschews crypto might seem unusual, especially after bitcoin’s 60% jump since December 2023. But it should seem like “old times” to those who remember what the blockchain space was like prior to the crypto boom of 2017.
It’s a return to what many saw as the enterprise goals of the technology: provide an immutable record for assets, transactions, and any other important documents.
Record keeping may seem like a boring endeavor, but back in 2016, that is how software giants like Microsoft and SAP first started to pitch the solution using blockchain.
At the time, cryptocurrencies were just viewed as the funds needed to power blockchains. They were not the main attraction.
The return of a public, cryptoless blockchain has been well-received, Brabon and Nichol tell Tech in Asia. Even though Stability launched its testnet in November 2023 and rolled out its mainnet just last month, it already has clients.
Stability has worked with a number of firms in industries such as gaming, fintech, and data authentication. But according to Nichol, the company’s breakthrough moment came when it was approved by Singapore’s Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) as a partner.
“We came to Singapore in January to show IMDA what we have built with our Global Trust Network,” he says. “And they asked us to build a reference implementation using their TradeTrust framework, which we did, and they approved us.”

IMDA’s approval came in only six weeks, which Brabon attributes to Stability’s tokenless system. Of the four public blockchain networks approved by IMDA to support the TradeTrust initiative, which includes Ethereum, Polygon, and XDC, Stability is the only one that is cryptoless.
“Stability’s expertise will enhance and improve international trade processes through the blockchain technology, without involving the use of cryptocurrency,” Loh Sin Yong, director of TradeTrust, tells Tech in Asia via email. “This will help to continue cultivating trust and efficiency in the global trade ecosystem.”
The TradeTrust framework’s goal is to digitize global trade documentation, which include bills of lading, critical paperwork for the 3.1 billion gross tonnage of goods that flowed through the Port of Singapore last year. TradeTrust hopes to accomplish its goal by 2030.
The monetary savings of digitalization could reach into the billions.
According to McKinsey, a global management consultancy firm, electronic bills of lading could save the global industry US$6.5 billion in direct costs as well as enable US$40 billion in global trade. McKinsey estimates that bills of lading account for between 10% and 30% of total trade documentation costs.
The return of an old idea: digitalizing trade
Digitalizing global trade documentation was one of the original objectives of the blockchain community.
Stability will start conducting live trials for IMDA’s TradeTrust framework on the Global Trust Network this month, and the implications are huge. The first company that Stability will be working with is from China.
According to Brabon, while China has a ban on cryptocurrency, it currently has no ban on blockchains, which means that Stability’s cryptoless system would be permissible. China is Singapore’s third-largest trading partner, accounting for 10.1% of the city-state’s total external trade in 2023.
The problem with the bills of lading is the time it takes to process them. Brabon says that it can take up to 30 days to get the stamps and signatures needed from the various agencies involved, adding billions to shipping costs.
There is also no room for error with bills of lading, as these documents confer ownership of a shipment to the person who holds it.
Stability hopes to shorten that process to seconds. Once the bills are digitized, they can then be tokenized, which would also make transferring or selling the commodities quicker than the current paper-based system. (The tokens used to digitize assets, called asset tokens, are different from those used for cryptocurrencies, which are called payment tokens.)
There are many reasons why the shipping industry has struggled with these issues. Private blockchains, legacy infrastructure, and a mindset that doesn’t see the need to digitalize top the list. Brabon sums it all up as an issue of trust.
Bringing trust back to blockchain
“There is no such thing on planet Earth as digital trust,” Nichol says.
The fraud, criminal investigations, and countless convictions in the crypto sector haven’t helped its reputation. Some blockchain companies have even pivoted anyway from their main business to focus on crypto, only to fail for reasons unrelated to their core technology, furthering the industry’s negative connotation in business circles.
Brabon shares that there has been no lack of offers made to them to launch a crypto token.
“At the end of the day, are we going to sacrifice the utility of a globally accessible, public trust network for some short-term crypto gains? The answer is absolutely no,” he says.
Brabon says that so far Stability is bootstrapped.
“We have suitors, as many do,” he adds. “We are a purpose-driven company, and we know the value of what we have here.”

Before Stability, Nichol led the US West Coast team at Galaxy Digital, where he worked on onboarding some of the first digital asset investment funds for the banking industry, including products for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.
Meanwhile, Brabon has worked in the blockchain space for 10 years. Prior to this, he was president of a nutraceutical manufacturing company.
There are other issues to address aside from crypto’s bad reputation, Brabon says. He points to issues with cost, scalability, regulatory changes, and even user interface. But that means changing how things are run on the backend.
Validators won’t be paid
Removing crypto and gas fees from its blockchain has had an impact on who Stability works with.
For example, the lack of crypto means that validators – those who verify transactions on a blockchain – are no longer incentivized with passive income. Instead, validation falls to companies that are looking for additional businesses related to the blockchain, such as auditing or enterprise resource planning (ERP).
“Whether you’re bringing all of this data and supply chain information now on chain, what about audit?” Nichol says. “What about these companies that need to have additional cloud support or need any type of advisory on blockchain?”
Nichol says Stability is currently in discussions with accounting firms, including Deloitte and EY, as well as leading cloud computing and ERP providers to act as validators. They are not yet live on the public mainnet.
There is also the way that Stability monetizes the system. There are no fees on on-chain transactions.
“Stability offers service and support akin to the Red Hat model, catering to enterprises or customers seeking additional features or custom requirements,” Nichol says.
He explains that pricing for service and support is based on industry-specific metrics, such as twenty-foot equivalent units for shipping or monthly active users for consumer industries.
“Given the highly customized nature of our pricing and the significant variations across industries, we prefer to maintain flexibility by keeping our service contract pricing open-ended,” Nichol adds.
He also points out that how users interact with blockchain needs to change, such as how wallets come into the picture. He describes the user experience of current crypto wallet offerings as “terrible.”
“Your mother is not going to use Metamask. My mother’s not,” Nichol says. “All that needs to change.”
What Stability is moving toward is a secure, enterprise-grade wallet solution that gives clients a single sign-on. Brabon points to Netflix and its Web2 interface as an example of what the team is going for.
“With the regular Web2 experiences, no matter how many servers you have to connect to, no matter how many databases you have to pull things from, you just login and watch a movie,” he explains. “No matter how complex it is behind, users are never exposed to the technology behind it.”
This, Brabon says, is the holy grail of “what we’ve all been trying to do.”",Stability Protocol recently partnered with Singapore’s IMDA to help the agency digitize trade documents on the Global Trust Network blockchain.,Scott Shuey,Editing by Collin Furtado and Lorenzo Kyle Subido,open,0,"",https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1712501724_STABILITY-_-IMDA-scaled.jpg,false,"",false,true,true,true,false,6,,1434,Stability Protocol looks to bring blockchain back to its roots,Stability Protocol recently partnered with Singapore’s IMDA to help the agency digitize trade documents on the Global Trust Network blockchain.,,,"","",""

TerraPay has secured a major payment institution (MPI) license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore, coming less than a year after it won preliminary approval for the same license.
With this license, the payments firm will be able to offer financial services to customers in the city-state. These include accounts issuance, domestic and cross-border remittances, merchant acquisition, and e-money distribution, according to a statement.
Following this development, TerraPay plans to strengthen current partnerships and forge new deals to broaden its presence in Asia Pacific. One of its more recent partnerships came in November last year, joining hands with Philippines-based fintech firm Maya for international remittance services.
TerraPay joins the growing list of MPI license holders in Singapore, which includes fintech firm Payoneer, USDC issuer Circle, and a unit of payments major PayerMax.
Primarily offering global money transfers, TerraPay provides access to an extensive cross-border payments network. While the company is headquartered in London, it has Asia offices in cities including Singapore and Bangalore.
Serving 30 markets worldwide, TerraPay connects with more than 7.5 billion bank accounts and over 2.1 billion mobile wallets across 144 recipient and 210 sender countries.

That’s how much Walmart paid in taxes to redomicile its fintech company, PhonePe, from Singapore to India in 2023. This process is known as a reverse flip, and it is trending among Indian startups looking to list on domestic stock exchanges.

Despite facing sizable tax liabilities, at least six startups that mainly operate in India are currently considering relocating their headquarters there. Meanwhile, nearly 20 unicorns and their investors have inquired about reverse flipping.
So do companies need to be headquartered in India for an IPO?
The listing rules do not say so. However, Rahul Charkha, a partner at Economic Laws Practice, tells Tech in Asia that “a company contemplating to list on Indian stock exchanges should have a separate legal entity in India.”
As the country’s IPO market booms, startups are opting to reverse flip to seize opportunities in the domestic market, leverage local advantages, and drive value creation.
The combined value of shares listed on India’s exchanges recently reached US$4.3 trillion, making the country the fourth-largest equity market globally and positioning it as “an alternative to China.”
Changing attitudes
Among the companies eyeing an IPO in India is fintech major Razorpay, which aims to do so in the next two years.
“The Indian market has shown its strength in the past 10 years, which gives us the confidence to list here,” says Razorpay co-founder and CEO Harshil Mathur.
New-age tech companies like Zomato and PolicyBazaar, which have recently debuted on the country’s stock exchange, have achieved profitability only after listing, demonstrating the strength of their business models and the potential of the India market.
Beauty ecommerce platform Nykaa, which was already profitable before its IPO in November 2021, has seen its profit nearly double year on year for the December quarter in 2023.

This was not the case a decade ago. “Ten years back, there was a notion that if you’re an unprofitable startup, you can’t go public in India,” says Ashwin Damera. His company, edtech player Eruditus, is “considering domiciling back to India from Singapore.”
To list, companies used to look for alternative locations such as the US, which has the most tech investor expertise and deepest pools of capital globally.
But times have changed.
The thriving stock market is providing an opportunity for founders to achieve better value for their startups by listing on India’s bourses.
There are also more domestic VCs focused exclusively on early-stage startups. According to data sourced from Venture Intelligence, there are at least 11 such VCs, and they collectively invested in 97 new portfolio startups in 2023 alone.

The growth of India’s early-stage ecosystem has also diminished the significance of Silicon Valley institutions. At least two companies in the chart above, including unicorns Razorpay and Groww, had US-based accelerator Y Combinator as an early backer.
Although Y Combinator is recognized as a global leader in backing early-stage startups, it recently faced allegations that it was pushing Indian startups to register outside the country. The accelerator has rejected these claims.
Nevertheless, some have admonished Y Combinator for this, saying that it “shouldn’t force Indian companies to flip to US/Singapore structures.”
This shift means that Indian startups aiming for IPOs are returning to their home country. Since the majority of these startups operate exclusively within India, establishing a local headquarters brings their management significantly closer to the market.

The motivation to reverse flip often comes from the founders, who were either born in India or have Indian ethnicity. “It is rooted in their desire to reconnect with their home country and tap into the potential advantages it offers,” says Salman Waris, an India-based technology lawyer who founded advisory company TechLegis.
Tax implications
The two most common methods of reverse flipping are share swaps and inbound mergers. Each approach has its own set of advantages and caveats.
In share swaps, shareholders of the overseas entity exchange their stake for stocks in the Indian entity. This results in both foreign and Indian shareholders holding stakes in the domestic company. Conversely, in a merger, the foreign company ceases to exist.

As shown by PhonePe’s example, reverse flipping can lead to a substantial tax liability, depending on a company’s valuation, the deal structure, and the legal and financial details.
Razorpay, which is planning a US$7.5 billion merger between its US-registered parent and India arm, may have to shell out US$250 million to US$300 million in taxes for its homecoming.
A reduced valuation would result in a smaller tax liability, but a hefty cut might not pass regulatory muster.
For example, if Razorpay reports a huge decrease in its valuation and a smaller tax liability, this would not be consistent with the company’s steady growth in the past few years. This would also attract the attention of US authorities, which get tax benefits as well under certain structures when startups reverse flip to India.
Indeed, there seems to be no respite from taxes in sight. Piyush Goyal, India’s commerce minister, recently said that startups looking to come back to the country will have to bear the tax liabilities.
He added that these companies went outside for their own “selfishness” but now want to list in India “because here’s where you get the valuations.”
Reverse flipping also has an impact on investors. For example, a US investor who backs the US entity of a startup that eventually reverse flips to India would have an added degree of separation from their investment.
While the ownership stake remains intact, the investor will now have greater exposure to India’s regulatory environment, which is different from the US, explains Waris of TechLegis.
Takeaways for SEA
While there are numerous parallels between India and Southeast Asia in the ecommerce, fintech, and edtech sectors, the phenomenon of reverse flipping has yet to gain traction in the latter.
Part of this has to do with how large India’s domestic market is. This vastness means that startups can thrive by focusing solely on the country for growth and fundraising.
That’s not the case for startups in Southeast Asia, though, except perhaps for those in Indonesia.

Many come to Singapore to raise funds due to its status as the region’s financial hub. Even Indonesian companies, including Bukalapak and Traveloka, have their holding companies registered in the city-state, where capital gains tax is nil.
“Most term sheets issued by regional VCs often state that setting up a Singapore holding company is a prerequisite if a startup intends to raise an equity round from them,” says Joel Shen, who heads the Asian technology and VC practice for law firm Withers.

However, Indonesia has its own pool of local investors. For companies focused on the domestic market, it may make more sense to rely on investors in Jakarta and raise funds there.
Shen thinks that while “there’s clearly money in Indonesia,” there’s only “a lukewarm interest in tech for now.”
The country’s tech ecosystem is also still fairly young compared to India’s. As such, it is still too early to predict if startups would be ready to flip from Singapore to Indonesia when the funding environment improves.","Driven by favorable market conditions and homeground advantage, Indian startups are returning to their native country to set up their headquarters.",Samreen Ahmad,Editing by Simon Huang and Eileen C Ang,open,0,"",https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/1671780232_PhonePe.jpg,false,"",false,true,true,true,false,6,,1224,Why are Indian startups ready to pay big for 'reverse flip'?,"Driven by favorable market conditions and homeground advantage, Indian startups are returning to their native country to set up their headquarters.",,,"","",""

Hi readers,
Looking back, I never truly recovered from Covid-19. I contracted the disease in 2021 and while I seemingly got a “milder” variant, there’s the odd numbing pain on the right lung whenever I do the weekend long, slow distance training. A side effect of Covid-19, per the family doctor.
Then there was the fact that I gained weight while adopting a work-from-home routine that also effectively blurred the lines between work and play. Like many, my then employers never provided anything to ease me into the whole WFH gig. The only thing they gave me was a 20% pay cut while expecting the same output.
Things are much better these days. I have shed the weight and I’m fitter. I’ve gotten a better gig at Tech in Asia (no, my bosses aren’t behind me as I type this), and there’s the in-house counseling that comes with it. I have yet to use this option though.
It would have been great if my then bosses had at least forked out for a service like Naluri. Even with the pay cut, I would probably have benefitted from the service and at least survived pandemic-induced lockdowns better. But such is life for the average Malaysian.
Healthtech firm Naluri is in the right space. Southeast Asia is a hotbed for chronic noncommunicable diseases, from obesity to diabetes to heart ailments.
But getting a buy-in from corporates remains tough because it all boils down to cost. It’s equally costly or costlier when an employee is down for the count. And we have yet to talk about mental health issues, which are on the rise.
Naluri’s journey has been bumpy, given the layoffs last year. Operating in Malaysia also doesn’t do the firm any favors as there’s a huge funding gap.
If anything, the one attitude that Naluri has – which many Malaysian startups should take note of – is the fact that the firm’s chiefs quickly realized the need to draw foreign capital in order to grow.
Naluri is back to basics now. But if it keeps up the attitude of going global, it might just be Malaysia’s next big thing – hopefully in a good way.

Hello reader,
As the tech winter wears on (I really hope things pick up sooner rather than later), I’ve noticed that there’s been a lot more fundraising going on outside the typical “money for equity” approach that usually happens with VC funding.
Debt rounds – where startups essentially “borrow” money from investors – seem more commonplace these days, and strategic investments appear to be occurring more often, as investors decide to put their money behind companies that will benefit them from more than just a financial point of view. Two of today’s biggest deals are strategic investments.
I guess the moral of the story is that we adapt to the circumstances and do what we can to just keep swimming. Sometimes it means approaching things from a different angle, and that’s cool.

1️⃣  The end of the megafund
VCs have been struggling to raise money. In the first three months of this year, they pulled in just US$30.4 billion globally. This follows a rough 2023, which saw the lowest fundraising on record since 2016. This might mean the end of the venture capital mega fund, as limited partners pull back on funding in the middle of an uncertain environment. This article from the Financial Times goes deeper.
2️⃣ Welcome to a new age
A number of Silicon Valley’s most iconic investors – LinkedIn’s Reid Hoffman, Sequoia Capital’s Michael Moritz, and Andreessen Horowitz’s Jeff Jordan, just to name a few – are stepping out of the limelight. This creates room for a new generation of venture capitalists to come of age, but they’re navigating a world that’s very different from before. Read more on The New York Times.

4️⃣ Wearing many hats
VCs are VCs… or are they? A VC is more than just an investor – they’re also entrepreneurs in their own right. Kjartan Rist, founding partner of London- and Copenhagen-based VC firm Concentric, shares his reflections on the similarities between investors and founders in this piece for Forbes.
5️⃣ Are the best deals sourced cold?

Pitik, an Indonesia-based poultry startup, has recently laid off some of its employees as the company reevaluates its business operations, CEO Arief Witjaksono confirmed.
“We remain focused on consistently assessing Pitik’s operations to ensure alignment with the business objectives and its adaptability to market changes,” Witjaksono told Tech in Asia Indonesia in a statement. It’s unclear how many employees were affected.
He added that the company has committed to providing proper compensation.
Founded in 2019 by Witjaksono and Rymax Joehana, Pitik provides partner farmers with a full-stack livestock management technology service, including IoT-based systems and tools. The firm also distributes chicken products directly to consumers.
According to Tech in Asia data, Pitik last secured a US$14 million series A funding round led by Alpha JWC Ventures in May 2022. MDI Ventures, Wavemaker Partners, and Arise also participated.
In October 2022, Pitik recorded US$12.2 million in revenue, a 20x growth from the US$600,000 it made in October 2021, Tech in Asia previously reported.
Chicken consumption in Indonesia is expected to grow from 8.2 kilograms per capita in 2022 to 9.3 kilograms per capita by 2029, according to Statista.
However, Pitik has previously said that demand fluctuates as many Indonesians still consider chicken a luxury food.
To diversify its revenue source, the company has developed chicken-processing capabilities and provided financing to chicken farmers. Pitik’s local competitors include BroilerX and Chickin.

Astroscale, a Japan-based company dealing with space waste, is planning to list on the Tokyo Stock Exchange by June after consulting with global investors last month, Reuters reported.
The company, which cleans up used rockets and retired satellites orbiting Earth, mulled over an IPO last year, but disagreements over company valuation halted these plans.
If the plan goes through, Astroscale would join the likes of iQPS and Ispace, two other publicly listed Japanese spacetech firms.
Japan’s government plans to double the market size of its space sector to US$53 billion within a decade. However, increased scrutiny followed Ispace’s failed moon landing last year, which slashed its share value.
While the market sentiment of spacetech firms is largely positive, high-stake investors are also thoroughly reviewing startups in the sector due to inherent high risks, the report noted.
Founded in 2013, Astroscale last raised funding in February 2023, closing its series G round at US$76 million. At the time, the company said it planned to boost the development of its on-orbit services.
Nobu Okada, Astroscale founder and CEO, said at the time that the company plans “to make on-orbit servicing routine by 2030.”

Hello reader,
AI is everywhere nowadays, and it’s more accessible than ever thanks to the sheer number of AI tools available: ChatGPT, Midjourney, Grammarly, and more. Heck, I found out the other day that Microsoft Edge comes with an Image Creator Tool powered by AI system Dall-E, which I must say may be the most compelling use case I’ve seen for installing Microsoft Edge yet.
Of course, the tools themselves only go so far. It’s what we do with them that really matters. AI can make a tremendous difference to businesses and their operations, but the trick is in knowing how to actually leverage the tech to work more effectively and productively.
Today’s premium story features a fish farming company in Singapore that’s done just that. It’s a great story, but now the song “Under the Sea” from Disney’s The Little Mermaid is stuck in my head for some reason.
Today we look at:

An aquafarm in Singapore that’s taken to AI like a fish to water 
TikTok Shop and Tokopedia’s integration process 
Other newsy highlights such as “buy now, pay later” firm BillEase’s 2023 numbers and a biotech startup’s seed round 


Premium summary
Under the sea, under the sea 🎵

The Fish Farmer, a Singapore-based aquaculture company, is using sensors and AI to make its operations more efficient. Here’s how:


Adapting to the ocean: Automation and robotics are out of the question for fish farms in the sea, as seawater is highly corrosive and will eat away at equipment. Plus, there’s no access to electricity to power anything grand. The Fish Farmer’s solution is an IoT software that leverages solar-powered physical sensors that give real-time data to employees. 

Problem solving: Each sensor monitors different aspects of the farm environment, from the water quality in the tanks of live fish to the temperature of cold rooms and chiller facilities where harvested fish are stored. This has helped The Fish Farmer, which operates four farms in Singapore, address challenges such as counting fish numbers accurately and avoiding wipeouts due to adverse water conditions. 

The value of AI: These technologies have freed up farm employees’ time for higher-value tasks. The company also plans to send staff to take up a diploma in aquaculture management and technology at Temasek Polytechnic to broaden their skill sets.

TikTok Shop 🤝 Tokopedia

Image credit: Timmy Loen

TikTok Shop and Tokopedia have finished integrating their systems as per merger requirements, said Melissa Siska Juminto, president of ecommerce at GoTo Group.


A new look: The integration, which resulted in the Shop Tokopedia brand, was completed as of March 27. All ecommerce activities on Shop Tokopedia, including payments, ordering activities, and transactions are now being entirely carried out on Tokopedia’s electronic systems. Social media accounts have also been separated, and branding across the new entity’s platform has been made consistent to the Shop Tokopedia name.

In accordance: TikTok needed to establish a new entity, obtain an ecommerce license from the Ministry of Trade, and create a standalone TikTok Shop app to reverse its ban in Indonesia – all of which are now fulfilled. With that, Tokopedia and TikTok Shop can now focus on execution

Not quite out of the woods yet: For now, Indonesia’s Ministry of Trade – which issues ecommerce regulations in the country – will audit the integration process after four months to decide whether there are still any violations.

Hi there,
One of my favorite sayings is “You can’t see the forest for the trees.”
It encapsulates the problem with short-sighted thinking that all humans face, from the biggest decisions down to the smallest. A fifth beer for the night won’t hurt until your alarm goes off at 7 a.m. the next morning.
Hangovers are one thing, but short-sighted thinking on large-scale environmental decisions is another kettle of fish. Just look at today’s Deep Read, which dives into the solar-powered water pumps being used in India and elsewhere.
While cheap irrigation water may seem like a great thing, the long-term consequence appears to be the depletion of groundwater wherever these pumps are used. That’s the type of short-sighted thinking that has lasting repercussions.

THE BIG STORY
Vietnamese battery startups eye more green financing to power renewables push

Solar panel installation in Vietnam / Photo credit: thelamephotographer / Shutterstock

Vietnam wants to push its energy mix away from fossil fuels like coal and toward renewables like hydrogen and ammonia. One obstacle to that goal is the high cost of importing batteries.
The solution could be homegrown battery technologies, particularly as government incentives are lacking, which makes it tough for businesses to pay the high upfront costs to import large battery systems.
DEEP READ
Solar-powered farming is quickly depleting the world’s groundwater supply

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Solar-powered pumps may seem like the perfect solution to the parched farmlands of places like Rajasthan in India. The tech helps bring irrigation water from beneath the ground to farmers’ fields, and by 2026, more than 3 million farmers in the country will be employing the technique.
But what happens when the groundwater runs out? That’s a question facing communities across India and Africa, as the success of solar pumps is quickly depleting the water supply beneath the ground.
Ironically, groundwater depletion will threaten food security, something the solar pumps were meant to help tackle. Yet in the short term at least, there appears to be little desire from policymakers, farmers, or development agencies to slow the pumps – even if groundwater depletion severely harms water resources.

1️⃣ China’s solar billionaire feels the heat as sector faces upheaval
A global supply glut of solar panels has pushed prices down, forcing Chinese solar panel billionaire Li Zhenguo – the founder of Longi Green Energy Technology – to lay off thousands of employees. A production boom in China resulted in an oversupply.
Why it matters:
Analysts fear mass job cuts across the solar energy sector as it faces a bust cycle after focusing on output rather than sustainable profits. While cheap solar panels sound like a good thing in theory, in the long run, the industry needs to find sustainable economics to make a lasting impact on the climate crisis.
2️⃣AI likely to increase energy use and accelerate climate misinformation – report
Environmental groups have warned that AI tech will likely hinder, not help, the fight against climate change. The Climate Action Against Disinformation coalition says that the tech will cause energy use to rise due to the data centers needed to power it. The coalition also warns that climate disinformation will proliferate due to the technology.
Why it matters:
Reports like this are a reminder that if AI is to be used as a tool to fight climate change, as many believe it can be, careful development and regulation of the tech are likely needed.

3️⃣Xiaomi jots down 50,000 orders in 30 minutes in maiden EV’s launch
Chinese tech player Xiaomi has expanded its product lines beyond smartphones and electronics by joining the electric vehicle race. Its first model, the SU7, sold 50,000 units within the first half hour of release.
Why it matters:
More competition in the EV market will likely help keep pushing prices down and quality up, spurring adoption.
4️⃣VinFast founder to invest $404m in new EV charging venture
Pham Nhat Vuong, founder of Vietnamese EV maker VinFast, has launched a new venture called V-Green to develop and deploy an EV charging station ecosystem. V-Green will invest nearly US$404 million over the next two years on the effort.
Why it matters:
Replacing internal combustion engines with EVs means also replacing the fuel pumps. It’s a monumental undertaking the world over, and US$404 million is a drop in the ocean but a welcome one.
5️⃣China doubles down on greentech, energy transition
China’s Premier Li Qiang has announced that the country plans to accelerate investment in clean energy projects. The government is aiming for the solar panel, EV, and lithium battery industries to spur economic growth and replace the clothing, furniture, and appliances sectors.
Why it matters:
More spending by the world’s second-biggest economy on energy transition signals to the rest of the planet that they better catch up.

Fresh off the close of its new US$750 million fund, B Capital has made two new appointments to its executive team.
The investment firm, established by Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin, has named Rich Lesser as vice chair of climate and sustainability as well as senior advisor. It has also appointed Jeff Johnson as general partner.
Lesser serves – and will continue to serve – as global chair of Boston Consulting Group, having also been the company’s CEO from 2013 to 2021. He has held the chief advisor role for the World Economic Forum’s Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders.
Meanwhile, Johnson is a seasoned climate and tech expert, bringing in over 25 years of experience in the two industries. He previously served as the managing director of Temasek, and he also co-founded Xpansiv, a market infrastructure provider for environmental commodities.
These recruitments align with B Capital’s objective to finance businesses aiming at global net-zero targets. It previously invested in carbon credit platform Patch Technologies and AI-powered decarbonization solutions provider Accacia.
Notably, climate tech is one of the focus areas of B Capital’s new US$750 million fund. It will scout for funding deals in North America and Asia, with most of the amount set aside for the VC firm’s existing portfolio.

Sachin Bansal, co-founder of Indian ecommerce giant Flipkart, is in talks to secure the first major external funding round for his fintech startup, Navi Technologies. He aims to raise US$200 million to US$$400 million at a US$2 billion valuation via the negotiations, which were reported by *TechCrunch*.
This marks a shift for Bansal, who bootstrapped Navi since its 2018 founding following a lucrative Flipkart exit. The company, which offers personal loans, home loans, and health insurance, had originally planned a US$440 million listing in 2022, though it later abandoned those plans amid an IPO slump.
Adding to its woes, the Reserve Bank of India – the country’s central bank – denied the banking application of its microfinancing unit, Chaitanya. The rejection had also prevented Navi from also securing pre-IPO funding from SoftBank and other investors at a valuation of over US$4 billion.
Navi ultimately sold Chaitanya for US$178.5 million in August 2023 to streamline its focus. Regardless, Bansal said in an interview with Moneycontrol that he remained open to future IPO possibilities and securing a banking license for Navi.
Last year, Navi reported a profit of US$4.4 million for the six-month period ending September 2023.

According to a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the global gaming industry could be worth US$321 billion by 2026, and India plays a key role. The country’s gaming industry is the largest in the world, with 568 million gamers and over 9.5 billion gaming app downloads in 2023.
Recently, Indian gaming giant Nazara Technologies earmarked US$100 million for global expansion, and VC firm Centre Court Capital is following suit. The company, which invests in sports tech and gaming projects, is launching a US$42 million fund aimed at those two industries in India.
The fund, which is looking to to back tech-driven startups redefining how sports are played and consumed in India, was founded by former pro tennis player Mustafa Ghouse and Alok Samtaney, who has had years of experience in private equity investing.
Centre Court Capital’s anchor investor is the Sajjan Jindal Family Trust, a major investor in the sports arm of Indian conglomerate JSW. Other backers include the Small Industries Development Bank of India, PremjiInvest, USK Capital, and major corporate sports investors.
Between August 2020 and 2022, the Indian gaming sector landed US$1.5 billion in funding, propelling several startups such as Dream Sports and MPL to attain unicorn status. VCs have also made moves: Gaming-focused investment firm Lumikai, for instance, launched its second fund worth US$50 million in 2023.

US chipmaker Nvidia is partnering Indonesian telco Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison to open an AI center – whose construction is expected to start this year – in the city of Surakarta, Central Java. To that end, both companies are committing US$200 million to build the center’s infrastructure and develop the necessary human resources.
In January 2022, Nvidia signed a memorandum of understanding with the Indonesian government. The chipmaker had pledged to train lecturers and over 20,000 university students in AI skills over a five-year period.
Nvidia has heightened its push in Southeast Asia as it achieved record revenues on the back of generative AI demand. Singapore telco Singtel recently partnered with Nvidia for a new data center brand, while the Singapore Institute of Technology also announced a new AI center in collaboration with the chipmaker.
It also reportedly aims to build a pilot manufacturing plant in Malaysia in collaboration with Kinsus Interconnect Technology, a Taiwanese supplier for Nvidia rival AMD.
After a visit to Vietnam last year, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also announced plans to expand its partnership with Vietnamese tech firms, among other initiatives.
Budi Arie Setiadi, Indonesia’s minister of communications and information, said in a statement that the quality human resources and 5G availability were what drew Nvidia and Indosat to Surakarta, whose current mayor is Gibran Rakabuming Raka, the incoming vice president and son of outgoing President Joko Widodo.

Hello reader,
I recently watched a TikTok video that explained why Taylor Swift’s fans are as devoted as they are. Essentially, due to her longevity, many fans have been able to grow up alongside her music; in other words, her songs make up the soundtrack of their lives.
That finally gave me some insight into her whole fandom, which can seem a bit much at times. I get it now, although I still don’t quite understand why they have to pin all their hopes and dreams on her – can’t one have multiple role models at any one time?
My creative influences, for example, run the gamut from rock bands (Led Zeppelin, Rage Against The Machine) to detective novel writers (Agatha Christie).
But I’m not here to yuck anyone’s yum. This opening spiel just points out the important role that leading lights play in our lives, and that’s no different in the Southeast Asian tech scene, with many of us invested – sometimes literally – in the activities and performance of the likes of Grab, Sea Group, and GoTo.
Today’s featured premium article takes a look at the financial figures of the region’s publicly listed tech firms in 19 handy-dandy charts.
Today we look at:


19 charts that give insights into how Southeast Asia’s tech giants are doing

If there’s one thing I’ve learned as a writer and a student of the arts (I double majored in communications and politics), it’s the importance of research and academic rigor. Multiple sources and pieces of evidence are required to support any one point made, all to provide context and to make a compelling case for whatever argument you’re making.
Today’s charts cover figures such as market value, adjusted EBITDA, and even employee headcount. But I’d argue that to really figure out what a company’s about and how it’s doing, you should do more reading on their specific activities across the months and years.
Aren’t you lucky? You can find these in-depth investigations on Tech in Asia, but let’s just focus on what’s in front of us for now.


See? Context matters: The charts show a massive net loss for GoTo, but that’s due to the sale of Tokopedia to TikTok. The portion of the net loss attributed to the deal is non-recurring and non-cash in nature, which means it has no impact on the company’s adjusted EBITDA and cash flow.

Top of the pops: Sea Group has consistently led in market value compared to other listed tech firms in the region. The latest figures put its market value at US$30.4 billion, with second place Grab coming in with US$12.3 billion.

Bang for buck: By Q1 2023, Grab surpassed Sea Group in annual revenue per employee, and it has stayed on top since.

Singapore-based electric vehicle manufacturer Scorpio Electric has chosen distributors in Japan, Spain, Portugal, and the Philippines. These distributors will facilitate sales for the X1 maxi-scooter, the firm’s first EV.


Selection criteria: According to CEO Joshua Goh, Scorpio Electric chose these countries due to their sizable two-wheeler customer base and rising demand for electric transport, among other factors.

All in: To prepare for the launch of the X1 – with production and delivery beginning in late 2024 – Scorpio Electric has engaged with local officials in each target market to ensure that it has all the needed regulatory approvals.

Money matters: In January 2023, the company raised US$6.8 million at a US$150 million valuation.

Southeast Asia’s tech landscape is still feeling the funding crunch: the region’s startups collectively raised just US$1.2 billion in the first quarter of 2024. That’s over 29% lower compared to the same quarter last year, and an 82.6% drop versus Q1 2022, according to Tech in Asia data.
The Q1 2024 figure is also a drop compared to Q4 2023. This reverses the momentum that Southeast Asia was building up in the past year, as there had been consistent quarter-on-quarter growth since Q1 2023.
That said, Q1 2024 had 182 deals, which is an improvement over the previous quarter’s 144.
Q1 2024’s numbers come despite some notable signs of recovery in Southeast Asia last year. In Q4 2023, the region’s startups banked a total of US$4 billion – the largest amount since Q2 2022, when startups raised US$3.9 billion.
Still, some experts expect this slowdown in capital to permeate throughout 2024 as well, and overall, 2023 was not a great year for the region’s VC funding landscape. The year saw the lowest total amount raised since 2018 and had the second-lowest number of deals.
Aligning with a recent report from January Capital, this decline was mainly due to a decrease in later-stage funding, which typically fetches higher investment amounts. Quarter on quarter, however, there was a slight increase in amount raised for series B through D funding rounds in Q1 2024.
A recent analysis from PitchBook also showed heightened pressure for both investors and mature startups, with cash returns getting more difficult to come by amid tightening regulations over startup listings. This also comes despite Southeast Asia logging over a 56% growth in total gross domestic product, the report noted, citing data from the International Monetary Fund.
Looking at the numbers geographically, Singapore remains the region’s financial center, leading with US$867 million in funding raised. This was also corroborated by both the PitchBook and January Capital reports.
It was followed by Indonesia’s US$152 million, which was a steep drop from Q4 2023’s US$2.5 billion. That said, the country saw more deals in Q1 2024 compared to the previous quarter.

Hi there,
The logistics industry in Southeast Asia has undergone a transformation in recent years. These days, many ecommerce players are building their own logistics fleet, as we’ve seen from Shopee, Lazada, and Tokopedia.
This has prompted existing third-party logistics (3PL) firms to diversify their services, given that shipment volume from ecommerce platforms will inevitably decrease. Additionally, there is still intense price competition among 3PL players – an ongoing challenge for years.
Singapore-based Ninja Van, for instance, has been exploring new services such as Ninja Mart, a B2B service for fast-moving consumer goods, as well as cold chain logistics.
In its earnings report for the financial year ended June 2023, the company reported that sales from Ninja Mart doubled year on year. Although its overall revenue contribution is still small – at under 20% – Ninja Van CEO Lai Chang Wen claims the service has better unit economics than ecommerce logistics.
As my colleague Simon notes in this week’s Big Story, Lai’s diversification strategy might be a glimmer of hope for the company, whose revenue was down by 7% year on year and operating losses widened by 32% during the period.
Meanwhile, I analyze Blibli’s bet to invest heavily in physical stores to differentiate itself from other ecommerce players in this week’s Hot Take. Expanding its offline presence has been Blibli’s focus in recent years – and it might be paying off.

THE BIG STORY
Ninja Van eyes path beyond ecommerce as price war dents FY23 earnings

Between FY 2023 and FY 2022, Ninja Van saw its top line grow by 93% in Singapore, 24% in Vietnam, and 11% in Malaysia.

THE HOT TAKE
Blibli’s bet on physical stores is starting to pay off

A Blibli Store in Jakarta / Photo credit: Blibli

Here’s what happened:

Blibli, an Indonesia-based ecommerce major, reduced its operating losses by 28% in 2023.
The company’s net revenue also shrank by roughly 4% year on year.
A strategy to focus on more profitable product selections across categories in B2C ecommerce sales led to the decline in net revenue, the company said.

Here’s our take:
GoTo Group may have achieved its first profitable quarter in Q4 2023, but its peers like Blibli are still chasing profitability.
For Blibli, which is targeting affluent customers through the sales of smartphones and other electronics, investing in physical stores and logistics has been and remains a key focus as many consumers still prefer hitting the stores when buying electronic products.
In 2023, it began construction of a new warehouse. Located in Marunda, West Java, the facility is expected to be Blibli’s largest when it becomes operational this year.
The company also opened 40 new consumer electronic stores last year, bringing its total number of brick-and-mortar stores in Indonesia to 166. This consists of 87 monobrand outlets (such as Samsung and Apple stores) and 79 multibrand stores, most of which are located in malls and shopping centers.
While marketplaces like Shopee and Lazada also sell electronic products, including smartphones from third-party authorized resellers and unauthorized resellers, Blibli’s status as an authorized Apple reseller and offline stores to support the purchase experience set the firm apart.
In addition, the company owns 65 supermarkets under the premium Ranch Market brand – which Blibli acquired in 2021.

Its offline strategy differentiates Blibli from other ecommerce players like Shopee, Tokopedia, and TikTok Shop, which operate exclusively online and whose most popular goods typically include apparel and beauty products.
While Blibli’s net revenue declined slightly in FY 2023, physical stores was one segment that grew during the period.
Net revenue for the physical stores segment was up by 18% to US$263 million, which accounted for 28% of the company’s total revenue. This revenue figure is not significantly different from the total processing value (TPV) recorded for the segment – US$294 million – in the period.
In contrast, its third-party retail segment, which serves merchants using the Blibli platform and its online travel agency Tiket.com, logged US$3.1 billion in TPV but only generated net revenue of US$68.9 million.
A post-pandemic uptick in mall visitors in Indonesia could be a bright spot for Blibli’s offline business. According to data from the Indonesian Shopping Center Association (APPBI), the mall visit rate in the country reached 80% last year and is expected to reach 90% this year.
Not surprising, Blibli stated that the company will continue to focus on developing its omnichannel strategy through further expansion of its physical stores in the future.
While the prospects for Blibli’s offline strategy so far look promising, a similar strategy was once implemented by JD.id, though the Indonesian subsidiary of JD.com ultimately shut its operations in the country in March 2023.
Like Blibli, JD.id also opened consumer electronics stores in malls across the country, though its rate of offline expansion was less aggressive. As of January 2022, the number of JD.id outlets was only around eight, much smaller compared to what Blibli currently has.
Blibli’s more sizable offline footprint may give the firm a better shot than JD.id in expanding into the offline market. Moreover, it has also integrated its online platform with physical outlets, allowing buyers to purchase products on its app or website and pick them up in-store.

When a customer enters a sales meeting, they often already have some idea of what the product or service is – thanks to the wealth of information available on websites, email newsletters, or ad campaigns. That means salespeople need to have even deeper product knowledge, especially when it comes to proprietary company information.
But that can be a fragmented process: Such information may be present across many different documents, for instance, or even across multiple teams. A salesperson may not have much time to keep the prospective customer engaged.
That’s where SiftHub comes in. The AI platform, based in India and the US, aims to help salespeople find up-to-date information and generate accurate responses to customer questions through a single hub.
The company has now raised US$5.5 million in a seed funding round co-led by Matrix Partners India and Blume Ventures. Neon Fund also participated in the round, as did angel investors like the founders of Razorpay.
The expectations for sales teams “have changed – they need to know advanced product, technical, and legal information to get the win,” said Pranay Desai, managing director at Matrix Partners India. “We are excited by SiftHub’s vision to use AI to manage product knowledge so that sales can focus on relationships.”
SiftHub said that its platform, which uses large language models fine-tuned with industry-specific knowledge, is equipped with semantic search features that don’t require toggling between screens. It also supports one-click integrations with workplace apps like customer relationship management or knowledge base tools.
The company was founded last year by serial SaaS entrepreneur Manisha Raisinghani. Her previous startup, delivery automation platform LogiNext, has raised US$49 million in disclosed funding from investors like Paytm and Tiger Global Management.

843395,2024-04-04T06:00:42,2024-04-04T10:08:57,The official unofficial tier list of priorities for expansion in Asia,official-unofficial-tier-list-priorities-expansion-asia,publish,post,https://www.techinasia.com/official-unofficial-tier-list-priorities-expansion-asia,"Superman might be one of the strongest superheroes in fiction, but apart from Kryptonite, he’s got another glaring weakness: He can’t be everywhere at once.
If someone as powerful as Superman can’t do that, imagine how your average startup founder must feel – everyone’s human after all.
No matter how capable they are, founders with limited resources can’t really afford to direct capital and personnel to every single effort at the same time.
Prioritization is key – and one of the most important times where your business will need to do that is when it’s expanding to other markets. New responsibilities – such as hiring new people and establishing new supply lines – abound, along with the need to ensure regular business success.
To help entrepreneurs in Asia expand successfully around the region, we enlisted the help of Young-duk Kim, CEO of South Korean startup hub Dcamp, to create a tier list of considerations to look out for.

S-Tier: product-market fit
“When going international, product-market fit is everything,” says Kim.
This has to be step one for every company before it decides on whether expansion within Asia is worth it. Founders will need to ask themselves whether their solutions are actually wanted in the market they’re targeting, as well as whether their solutions can solve market-specific needs.
Kim says that without knowing the answers to these questions, startups will rarely be able to direct efforts correctly, and they’ll be unable to provide additional or new value to that market’s customers. Eventually, they’ll end up not being competitive enough to survive.

Kim shares the positive example of Gangnam Unni, a South Korean platform that provides medical information and reviews to domestic and foreign consumers who are looking for dermatology and plastic surgery services. The firm entered Japan only after locals seeking information on South Korean plastic surgery started sharing Japanese translations of the Gangnam Unni app screen through internet communities.
This, along with a formal evaluation process, proved the business viability of Gangnam Unni in Japan.
A-Tier: adapting to different customs
When in Rome, do as the Romans do. As a foreign company that’s entering another country to conduct business, it’s critical to ensure that the firm can adapt to the market’s specific behaviors.
How some markets’ businesses traditionally build trust with partners or gain market share can vary wildly from country to country. In some places, important stakeholders – such as business leaders or government regulators – heavily emphasize doing things by the book.
For instance, countries like Japan have customs such as using the right honorifics or exchanging business cards.

Some markets in Asia also require founders to be more “street smart,” as Kim puts it. That’s due to the concept of Guanxi in China and some Southeast Asian countries where Confucianism has a strong cultural presence.
“In these markets, there is a kind of inner circle that’s based on trust, and this can affect business a lot,” says Kim.
In these cases, founders looking to expand may need to establish strong personal connections with potential partners before any sort of business-related steps can be made.
In doing so, founders can establish that they’re willing to help partners on a deeper, personal level, rather than only being obligated by business contracts. Naturally, this leads to stronger trust and a smoother working process when expanding.
“This way of doing things can be seen as less transparent, which may cause you some trouble if you’re not used to it. However, the benefits might be worth the effort,” Kim shares.
“It’s all about weighing out the pros and cons.”
B-Tier: finding the right intermediary
On the topic of trust, even knowing the right steps to take may sometimes not be enough. Additionally, having a strong track record in your home market may not be as helpful as some founders might think.
“Even if you have 10,000 customers in Korea, it doesn’t mean anything in a new market. You can claim that your service is good, but locals have to test it first too,” Kim says.
That’s where intermediaries come in – instead of having to slowly and painstakingly build trust with a large market, foreign startups should look for intermediaries to vouch for them and introduce them to the right local partners.

“Without them, it can take five times as long to build trust as compared to your home market,” says Kim. “If you miscalculate this, you may delay your business expansion longer than expected and you could lose your foothold in that market entirely.”
Gangnam Unni, again, did this part right. It acquired Lucmo – a Japanese platform that lets consumers share post-cosmetic surgery photos and reviews – so that it could connect with domestic clinics, and then appointed an executive with extensive experience in the beauty sector to lead Gangnam Unni’s Japanese operations. The firm ultimately got 1,000 Japanese hospitals to register on the app, along with 900,000 users.
C-Tier: establishing trust with partners
It’s important for each side (the intermediary and the expanding startup) to establish a strong relationship because there’s a lot at stake – if one or both sides make a mistake, they could lose their connection and trust with local partners just as quickly as they got it.
One advice that Kim has for founders is to meet often with both intermediaries and local partners.
“There are things you can only find out with your five senses, such as the person’s facial expressions, tone of voice, demeanor, and small gestures. This allows you to know whether the person is trustworthy or just pretending, which shortens the time it takes to build trust,” he points out.

Jeon Jae-woong, CEO of South Korean metaverse platform Anipen, echoes this sentiment. He notes that when the firm was trying to expand to Japan, collaborative processes with partners often took “a long time” and required patience and endurance.
“There was a need for frequent face-to-face meetings to update each other and build trust, which necessitated frequent travel between Korea and Japan,” he shares.
Besides one-on-one meetings, another way to facilitate interactions with partners is through organized meetups. Dcamp, for example, hosts a series of startup community meetups called MokTalks, which are currently held on a monthly basis in Singapore and Tokyo.
“It’s all about creating a trusted network that can act as intermediaries for each other or even direct partners,” Kim says.
Laying a solid foundation
Overall, taking a look at these considerations in order should help give founders a clearer idea of what to prioritize when expanding to other countries in Asia.
That said, it’s also important to remember that all these factors need to be taken into account – otherwise, founders risk creating gaps in their expansion plans.
As a lot of the underlying conversation around these considerations surrounds trust, Kim believes that organizations like Dcamp – which have the know-how and connections – play an important role in helping startups foster said trust.
In the coming years, the organization plans to continue running regular MokTalks to construct a solid foundation and network for founders to tap into when expanding within the region.
“Ultimately, we hope that the level of trust within each market will get deeper through strong connections,” says Kim.

Established in 2013, Dcamp is Korea’s first-ever startup hub. It actively invests in early-stage startups and helps entrepreneurs realize their business goals. On May 16, it’s hosting a demo day event – called May Dday – in Tokyo as well as a MokTalk in conjunction with SusHi Tech, Japan’s largest startup festival. Sign up for the demo day here.

This isn’t to say that Japan’s startup ecosystem isn’t going in the right direction. It has, and optimism is of the essence when looking at domestic funding numbers.
Comparatively, though, the country is boxing below its weight. Many Japanese founders have built their startups on the shoulders of the GAFAMs, the real, American winners of the global startup game so far.
The current, fourth generation of Japanese founders can alter that trend. It can compete internationally and build global winners, emulating Japanese post-World War II corporate behemoths like Sony, Honda, and Panasonic.
For that to happen, however, the ecosystem has to address a few challenges.
Generation game
The modern Japanese startup ecosystem can be divided into four generations.
The first generation, birthed during the late 1990s, included startups that presciently realized the internet’s transformative power. They all had a simple mandate: recreate the real world digitally.
Founders during the first generation all shared one common trait: They understood the internet’s potential before their peers did. From there, founder demographics varied widely.
Rakuten founder Hiroshi Mikitani, for instance, holds an MBA from Harvard and worked in banking. Kaneto Kanemoto, the founder of OKWave (known as “Japan’s Quora”) used to be homeless and launched his startup using his wife’s savings.
The second generation spawned following the burst of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s. Founders from that generation explored different types of internet businesses, resulting in diverse startups. Uzabase launched an online media offering, while Gree and Colopl rode the early mobile gaming wave.
The 2008 financial crisis, crystallized by the Lehman Brothers crash, brought the second generation to an abrupt stop. In Japan, the period was worsened by a fraud scandal involving a listed internet startup, Livedoor. These events all pumped the brakes on the Japanese startup dynamic.

The third generation saw the rebirth of the Japanese tech ecosystem, rising from the financial crisis’ ashes. Startups such as Mercari (ecommerce), Akatsuki (gaming), and SmartNews (a news curation app) leveraged the iPhone-boosted mobile app market.
That period, ranging from 2009 to 2013, marked a revival of Japan’s muted IPO market and resurrected startup investments.
This brings us to the current, fourth generation of Japanese startups. Most startups are innovating in deeptech, life sciences, and AI.
This generation’s founders need to possess hard, technical skills. The expense of their innovations also requires connections to the academic, corporate, or investor world, so the circle of “potential founders” has been reduced.
Home is where the heart is
Japan’s large, wealthy domestic market is a gift and a curse. It gives Japanese startups a ready supply of high-purchasing power customers.
Unfortunately, the supply is so large that in many cases, it doesn’t make rational sense for a homegrown startup to expand internationally.
This hurdle is amplified by another factor. In 1999, Japan’s stock market launched its so-called “Mothers” section (now known as Growth Market).
This category enabled smaller-cap startups to list, benefitting from softer listing requirements. It worked well – too well maybe. Around 300 Japanese startups are listed on the Growth Market today.
The Growth Market incentivizes relatively small but growing local startups to go public early.
This is attractive to founders for two main reasons: the ability to cash out, and the ego boost from publicly listing one’s company. It’s also a boon for venture capitalists, making it easier for them to get a liquid return on investment.
These early exits can reduce founders’ global ambition as they fail to see the point of potentially discomforting foreign forays. Even if the company wished to grow abroad, prolonged Japan-centric operations could lead to the product’s “Galapagosization,” rendering it incompatible with non-Japanese audiences.
Why hasn’t this issue affected Japan’s original corporations, which have evolved into undeniable global successes? Part of the reason may sound counterintuitive: These companies mainly focus on hardware, and selling hardware internationally is relatively easier if the products are excellent.
Translating the TV’s or the car’s instruction manual is an easy way to boost sales abroad. Of course, an effective marketing strategy is also essential.

Software, although easily distributed, contains a myriad of discreet cultural specificities that are harder to decipher and amend as one expands.
Attracting foreign talent in an insular culture
This global ambition deficiency can be cured by the inclusion of diverse, foreign talent into the Japanese ecosystem. That’s no easy task.
For all of its qualities, the nation isn’t known for being inclusive. It’s a homogenous society, tightly knit by a singular language spoken nowhere else.
In addition, Japan is a high-context culture, meaning that integration is quasi-impossible without a profound understanding of the intricacies, references, and norms of Japanese civilization.
Compare that with Silicon Valley, where a decades-long, steady flow of diverse talent has created a culture united by tech and ambition rather than societal traditions. The sometimes-mocked nebulous American culture is a formidable force for integration.
The US’ propensity to attract global talent has been a key factor in its startup success. According to this study, 64% of US unicorns were founded or co-founded by immigrants or the children of immigrants.
On the other hand, Japan’s startup ecosystem suffers from its enduring insularity.
Despite the government’s efforts to attract (and subsidize) foreign students, these students have a hard time staying post-graduation. The Japanese job market is largely to blame, made inhospitable by local companies’ reluctance to recruit foreigners.
Startups can provide a place for those talented foreign students. Startups are, by definition, more flexible in their recruitment and managerial style by way of being cash-strapped and hungry for rare talent. Since Japanese startups lack foreign talent, it’s a win-win situation.
These startups should make a conscious effort to tap into that pool of Japan-educated, foreign talent. One of the ways to spur such behavior is by encouraging Japanese founders to find foreign co-founders.
Mindset shift
The Japanese startup ecosystem is a victim of its own country’s success. Japan has stable, well-regarded corporate jobs: Why take the risk of working on something new out of your garage?
The domestic market is wealthy and large. Why go through the pain of expanding abroad? Japan has a millennial, homogenous, successful society. Why open up to foreigners?
Fundamentally, Japan has everything it materially needs to become a global startup leader. Its greatest challenge isn’t talent, infrastructure, or money. It’s the mindset.

Elon Musk’s Tesla is poised to make a splash in India, with a team arriving this month to explore potential locations for a new multibillion-dollar electric vehicle plant, Financial Times reported.
This move follows India’s recent decision to lower import tariffs on EVs, a concession Tesla lobbied heavily for. India charged a 70% to 100% import tax on automobiles, but that has now been reduced to as low as 15% if a company invests at least US$500 million and sets up a manufacturing plant in the country.
Musk had met with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi in June last year, expressing his desire to invest in India “as soon as humanly possible.”
According to the Financial Times, Tesla will prioritize automotive hubs in Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu, which all have established infrastructure and ports to facilitate exports. The focus on port proximity hints at Tesla’s global ambitions for the proposed factory.
Tesla has long had a deep relationship with China, which is both an important sales market as well as a manufacturing hub for the company. But local competitors like BYD have increasingly tightened competition domestically while rapidly expanding their affordable EVs to regions like Southeast Asia.
Perhaps in a bid to stop that momentum, Tesla is said to be aiming to produce a sub-US$30,000 model in India, appealing to consumers in Southeast Asia, the Gulf countries, Africa, and Europe.

Some recent funding rounds in Asia’s marketing tech (martech) space were focused on ultra-precise Web3 advertising and Line mini apps. But there’s also a case to be made for the basics: making sure your business is present on platforms like search engines and social media platforms.
That’s the premise behind SingleInterface, an India-based SaaS startup. The company’s primary business is to digitize a brand’s storefront. Whether it’s a car dealership, retail shop, or service center, SingleInterface can build a brand’s store locator and location pages as well as manage listings on platforms like Google Maps, Instagram, and Foursquare – all through a single dashboard.
After a decade of operations, SingleInterface has now bagged its biggest funding yet: a US$30 million round led by Singapore-based VC Asia Partners. PayPal Ventures, the VC arm of the global payment giant, also participated.
“Our suite of products has proven to deliver remarkable revenue growth for our clients, accounting in some cases for 15% to 20% of their revenues,” said Tarun Sobhani, SingleInterface’s co-founder and CEO. “We are committed to further invest in building our portfolio of AI-driven marketing and commerce-enabling products.”
SingleInterface also offers omnichannel marketing through chatbot services, hyperlocal ads, and the full integration of company catalogs on digital platforms. The company aims to use the fresh capital to establish market leadership in Asia and to develop products focused on “audience segmentation and personalized engagement.”
It currently has a presence in India, Australia, United Arab Emirates, Japan, South Korea and Southeast Asia, with plans to go deeper in these markets.
SingleInterface was set up in 2014 by Sobhani and Harish Bahl, who is the founder of Indian venture builder Smile Group. According to the company, customers include Mumbai-based conglomerates like Tata Group and Reliance Group, as well as companies like KFC, Pizza Hut, and Nissan.

Despite this, CEO Lai Chang Wen was optimistic in a media briefing ahead of Ninja Van’s earnings result, predicting that it would hit EBITDA breakeven in the next 12 months. After that, the last-mile delivery firm expects to break even on a net profit basis within another six months.

Lai played up Ninja Mart, a business-to-business service that delivers fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) to small retailers in the non-urban regions of Vietnam and Malaysia. While Ninja Mart is still small, it is growing and has better unit economics than ecommerce logistics.
Competition drives prices down 20%
The revenue drop in FY 2023 was not due to a decrease in volume of parcels handled. Instead, Lai attributed it to the prices for Ninja Van’s last-mile delivery services, which went “down almost 20%” year on year.

Ninja Van also had to go head-to-head with rivals like Indonesia-based J&amp;T Express, which pursued a “very aggressive” pricing strategy that allowed it to become the largest player in Southeast Asia. As a result, Ninja Van had to either match the lower prices or give up parcel volumes.
The tough pricing environment was reflected in J&amp;T Express’ 2023 financial performance. The firm recorded a revenue per parcel of US$0.81 in Southeast Asia last year – 15% lower than in 2022.
See also: Key takeaways from J&amp;T’s prospectus: rapid China growth offsets slowing SEA numbers
Ninja Van’s revenue by geography also reflected the intense competition it faced in Indonesia and the Philippines, which plunged by 33% and 45% year on year, respectively.
Ninja Van was one of many logistics companies that benefited from a rising ecommerce wave in Southeast Asia, which took off in around 2016. As users placed more orders on ecommerce platforms, firms offering fulfillment services grew alongside them. In 2021, ecommerce platforms accounted for around 70% of J&amp;T Express’ total shipments in Indonesia.
That dynamic, however, has shifted in recent years as ecommerce firms like Shopee and Tokopedia formed in-house logistics fleets. In addition, the sheer volume of orders these ecommerce marketplaces now process has given them significantly more bargaining power in negotiating delivery rates.
Ecommerce platforms such as Shopee and Tokopedia are also part of larger publicly listed companies that have faced pressure from investors to cut costs. This has led them to squeeze suppliers, including providers of logistics services.
In late 2022, Ninja Van and Shopee Philippines mutually agreed to terminate their relationship, although the logistics firm continued to partner with the Sea Group subsidiary in other Southeast Asian markets. Shopee also ended its partnership with QuadX, another logistics provider, at around the same time.

However, between FY 2023 and FY 2022, Ninja Van’s top line rose by 93% in Singapore, 24% in Vietnam, and 11% in Malaysia.
New business lines
Lai talked up the firm’s other lines of businesses, including Ninja Mart, whose sales doubled in FY 2023. The CEO also cited a new initiative in cold chain logistics as a bright spot.
Ninja Mart helps businesses such as biscuit company Julie’s and cigarette firm British American Tobacco deliver their products to provision stores located outside the metropolitan areas. Still, Ninja Mart made up just 17% of Ninja Van’s overall revenue in FY 2023.
Meanwhile, its cold chain logistics business targets suppliers that require a temperature-controlled means of transporting perishable items like fresh food to F&amp;B outlets in hard-to-reach locations.
For example, Lai pointed out that Southeast Asia’s existing infrastructure is insufficient to meet demand for deliveries of necessary ingredients for Japanese dishes, which is popular in the region.
He expects that Ninja Van’s growing B2B and cold chain businesses – which he claims have margins that are “on average 3x higher” than ecommerce – will drive it to profitability.
Indeed, the company’s FY 2023 results show that Ninja Mart’s revenue of US$125 million was about equal to its related expenses.
Cost-cutting doesn’t cut it
To offset how lower revenue from delivery services pulled down overall revenue in FY 2023, Ninja Van slashed costs in areas such as labor, marketing and advertising expenses, and transportation.

However, the company still “could not match the increase in productivity” with the reduction in parcel delivery prices,” Lai said.
As a result, total operating expenses climbed by 2% for the year.
Need for cash
Lai shared that the company is holding off on public listing plans for now and is prepared to accept a lower valuation as it considers further fundraising. The CEO has previously stressed that merely reaching breakeven “in itself is not a strong IPO story.”
Ninja Van could use the cash. In its most recent financial year, cash flow from operations fell to -US$182 million. In comparison, its cash and cash equivalents as well as fixed deposits are at US$207 million.

Assuming the same level of cash outflow from operations, this would give the company a runway of only a little over a year from end June 2023.
Of course, this cash flow amount is not static. Ninja Van has “significantly and prudently” rationalized costs over the past 18 months, including by reducing capacity, according to Lai. This should extend the firm’s runway.
He added that Ninja Van is open to new equity investment, especially from investors who can “strategically contribute” to its B2B and cold chain ambitions.
Two cold chain logistics startups secured investments in 2023: FreshFactory via a pre-series A fundraise and Coldspace through a seed round. Both companies are based in Indonesia.
However, these were relatively small funding rounds, raising around US$8 million in total.
The road ahead
Lai is positive about Ninja Van’s prospects in cold chain logistics, citing the company’s “strong” partnership with an unnamed but “major Japanese cold chain player.”
The Japanese partner will share its tech know-how as part of this arrangement, enabling Ninja Van to run an integrated cold chain network.

Ninja Van may be diversifying its business, but it can’t untangle itself from the ecommerce sector entirely.
Lai pointed out how the volume and frequency of ecommerce orders provides Ninja Van with a “baseload” that allows it to operate at a scale and frequency needed for B2B distribution and cold chain logistics.
He estimates that the sector’s steady-state share of total revenue would sink to around 50% from its current level of about 80%.
In the past, Ninja Van would take whatever ecommerce business it could get for growth. Nowadays, it is prioritizing its most profitable businesses.
“Our mistake was thinking [ecommerce] was our only path,” Lai concedes.

TikTok Shop and Tokopedia have finished integrating their systems as per merger requirements, said Melissa Siska Juminto, president of ecommerce at GoTo Group. The integration, which resulted in the Shop | Tokopedia brand, was completed as of March 27.
“All ecommerce activities on Shop | Tokopedia, including payments, ordering activities, and transactions are now being entirely carried out on Tokopedia’s electronic systems,” said Juminto in a statement shared with Tech in Asia.
“We have also separated social media accounts from ecommerce accounts in the TikTok application, complete with a choice of privacy settings according to user preferences.”
Aside from the payment integration between TikTok and Tokopedia, branding across the new entity’s platform – from the website’s homepage to Tokopedia’s seller dashboard – has been made consistent to the Shop | Tokopedia brand.
As Tech in Asia reported previously, TikTok needed to establish a new entity, obtain an ecommerce license from the Ministry of Trade, and create a standalone TikTok Shop app to reverse its ban in Indonesia – all of which are now fulfilled. With that, Tokopedia and TikTok Shop can now focus on execution, as GoTo CEO Patrick Walujo said in the company’s latest earnings call.
Pre-merger, TikTok Shop’s estimated Indonesia gross merchandise value (GMV) for 2023 was US$6 billion, compared to Tokopedia’s US$15.6 billion.
Juminto previously declined to disclose the post-merger GMV but said that the group is confident that they will meet “or even exceed our expectations” going forward.
For now, Indonesia’s Ministry of Trade – which has jurisdiction for issuing ecommerce regulations in the country – will audit the integration process after four months to decide whether there are still any violations.

Biotech startup Auristone has secured a US$4 million seed funding round led by venture capital firm Elev8. Seeds Capital, the investment arm of Enterprise Singapore, participated in the funding, along with existing investor Genedant.
“The human epigenome is the next frontier for unlocking precision healthcare,” said Aditya Mathur, managing director at Elev8. “Auristone stands out in this field, with its ability to profile molecules and predict their medical interactions using epigenomics biomarkers.”
The startup is focused on epigenomics, or the science of how genes are expressed. Auristone’s flagship product is a molecular profiling tech called Epi-Call, which helps predict an individual’s likelihood of response to different treatment options for cancer.
The funding will be used to drive more clinical collaborations and market adoption of Epi-Call.
“Seeds Capital looks forward to supporting Auristone as it scales into new markets such as South Korea, Japan and beyond,” said Tan Kaixin, general manager at Seeds Capital. “We are excited to partner with the team to further the adoption of epigenomics in genomic testing and create better, personalized healthcare.”

Singapore-based AI software startup Ailytics has raised US$2.7 million in an oversubscribed pre-series A funding round led by Tin Men Capital. Participating investors include Aurum Investments and AngelCentral.
Ailytics uses scenario-based AI-powered video analytics to help companies in the heavy industry improve operational safety and productivity. The company plans to use its fresh funds to expand its B2B services to other markets such as Hong Kong, Japan, Oceania, and the Middle East.
“We would also be able to increase our research and development efforts to build the next generation of video analytics solutions, powered by large vision models capable of handling complex domain specific tasks,” says Lenard Tan, the company’s founder and CEO.
The startup’s proprietary solution taps existing cameras to show real-time insights of unsafe acts, productivity metrics, and security breaches. Ailytics said its solution can operate in harsh and dynamic outdoor conditions even with lower resolution cameras, making it suitable for construction sites and manufacturing plants.
This marks Tin Men’s 11th investment in a B2B tech startup. Jeremy Tan, the VC’s co-founder, noted that companies in heavy industry face stricter safety standards imposed by regulators. Non-compliance can lead to delays, penalties, and revenue loss, with further challenges from rising labor costs amid a tighter market.
Since its founding in 2021, Ailytics’ solutions have been implemented in more than 70 projects across four countries. The company has integrated over 1,000 cameras, helping customers to reduce the need for manual inspections by up to 50%.
“By prioritizing safety, we aim to mitigate worksite accidents and minimise occupational hazards while enhancing process efficiency and maximizing return on investment,” says Ailytics’ Tan.

Hello reader,
It’s hard to swim against the tide, a truth that’s evident in both of our featured stories in today’s newsletter.
It’s fair to say that Singapore isn’t exactly a bastion of sporting success, yet Olympic medalist Joseph Schooling managed to overcome the odds in the pool on the way to gold. Now, he faces perhaps even longer odds of trying to make a dent in venture capital investing.
Meanwhile, Una Brands also faces a great deal of adversity. After all, the ecommerce roll-up industry isn’t awash with good news these days, as many similar firms are struggling to make ends meet.
Yet the Singapore-headquartered company says it turned profitable by one metric in the fourth quarter of last year, after making some hard decisions to reallocate resources and cut costs.

Newsletter GIF – Una Brands hits profit in tough industry – 1200×640

Despite a 10x uptick in net loss in 2022 compared to the year prior, Una Brands says it turned EBITDA profitable in the fourth quarter of 2023.
The firm, which is backed by Lazada Group founder and former CEO Maximilian Bittner, says the turnaround was brought about by measures to reallocate resources and cut costs.


Tough measures for tough times: Una Brands CFO Cho Weihao told Tech in Asia that the firm “had to make difficult decisions regarding reallocation of resources towards more profitable initiatives and products, and selective staff cost reductions.”

Sea change: In 2022, Una Brands focused mainly on growth and scaling up operations, said Cho. The year included the acquisitions of ergonomic chair brand ErgoTune and adjustable desk retailer EverDesk+, both Singapore-based companies. However, 2023 brought a change of course, with an eye on profitability and cost efficiencies.

TikTok impact: The labels Una Brands works with sell on various platforms, including TikTok Shop, Shopee, Lazada, and Amazon. According to Cho, TikTok Shop has become particularly important for Una Brands in Indonesia. Since TikTok Shop made a comeback in the country following its temporary ban, Una Brands has experienced a 2x surge in revenue from the channel, particularly in the beauty and wellness category.

The Olympian-to-venture capitalist pipeline isn’t exactly a well-worn one, but Joseph Schooling has always been a trailblazer.
Singapore’s first-ever Olympic gold medalist is retiring from competitive swimming to get into VC investing.


Team sport: The former swimmer is now a founding partner at Swaen Schooling Capital, alongside investment banker Cliff Go and serial entrepreneur Ben Ling. The firm appears to have been established in August 2022.

Starting gun: Swaen Schooling Capital will key in on early-stage investments in impact and sustainability, sports and wellness, and tech. The company has yet to announce any investments.

Feet wet: Schooling had previously dipped his toes in the investment waters. The Olympian invested in the pre-seed round of Singapore-based mental health startup Huddleverse in May 2023, according to Crunchbase.

WasteX, a climate tech startup operating in Indonesia and the Philippines, has raised US$450,000 from impact fund P4G Partnerships. The round comes less than two years after WasteX, which turns farm waste into biochar, launched out of venture builder Wavemaker Impact.
The company plans to use the fresh capital to establish biochar production facilities across Indonesia, in partnership with local mills and poultry farms.
The deal “requires and greatly supports the partnership to engage with national policy-making and market development,” said Pawel Kuznicki, founder and CEO of WasteX. “The objective is to facilitate the development of a favorable regulatory and commercial environment that would support the growth and adoption of the innovation.”
WasteX provides an end-to-end solution for farmers that can turn biomass into biochar through its proprietary, small-scale, and semiautomated carbonizer. While such equipment usually run on electricity, WasteX’s equipment operates using both biomass fuel and captured gas from the burning process of the organic matter.
The company says biochar has resulted in a 95% increase in yield for its partner corn farmers in the Philippines and Indonesia, while reducing fertilizer use by 50%. Farmers can also sell carbon credits through the WasteX app, as using the equipment leads to less emissions.
The use of biochar may come at an opportune time for farmers, as fertilizer prices worldwide continue to be volatile following geopolitical tensions and rising inflation. Prices have started to taper off last year, but threats of it rising again continues to linger.
Aside from Wavemaker Impact and P4G – whose grants are funded by the Danish, Dutch, and South Korean governments – WasteX also counts Tokyo-based Norinchukin Bank among its investors.

Crypto.com is launching its app in South Korea on April 29, almost two years after [acquiring](https://www.techinasia.com/cryptocom-secures-south-korean-operating-licenses) local platform OK-Bit. This marks the first time a foreign cryptocurrency exchange has entered South Korea and comes as Crypto.com expands its global footprint.
The new app will offer access to more than 150 cryptocurrencies, along with a suite of exclusive NFT projects. Additionally, users will benefit from educational resources provided by Crypto.com University.
In preparation for the app’s debut, Crypto.com has given a 30-day cessation notice to OK-Bit users, which will coincide with the new app’s launch. This step aligns with the company’s efforts to ensure compliance with South Korean crypto regulations.
The OK-Bit buy enabled Crypto.com to become registered under the Electronic Financial Transaction Act and as a Virtual Asset Service Provider in August 2022. The company has also established deals with leading South Korean brands across the finance, entertainment, and tech sectors.
However, regulations are only one part of Crypto.com’s South Korean journey, as it faces an uphill battle for market share against local leader Upbit.
In addition to South Korea, Crypto.com said it received a major payment institution license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore in June last year to offer digital payment token services in the city-state. It also has approvals or licenses in other markets, including Australia, Canada, the US, and the UK.

CB Insights has launched a new ranking for the top 100 global private AI companies, and Reka AI has made the list.
The company is a creator of generative AI models and is the fifth-largest firm on a valuation per employee basis – right behind OpenAI.
While based in San Francisco, the company has two Southeast Asian founders. Singaporean Yi Tay is the company’s chief scientist, while CEO Dani Yogatama grew up in Indonesia.
According to CB Insights, Reka AI’s valuation per employee – its valuation divided by the number of team members it has – clocks in at US$42.9 million.
The market intelligence platform pegs Reka AI’s last known valuation at US$300 million, meaning that the company only employs seven people, four of whom are listed as executives.
OpenAI, which placed fourth, is valued at US$80 billion, which puts its valuation per employee at US$58.2 million.
Of the top 100 companies, about 68% are developing varied AI solutions, with industries ranging from virtual worlds and automatic factories to underrepresented language models.
Collectively, these firms have raised US$28 billion through 240+ equity deals since 2020. OpenAI, which has raised US$12 billion, is responsible for 40% of this sum.
Reka AI, meanwhile, has raised US$58 million so far, which came in June 2023 from a round led by DST Global and Radical Ventures.
Still, many firms on the list have raised even less capital: A quarter of the companies have banked less than US$10 million, while a few have not raised any venture capital at all. Nineteen companies are valued above US$1 billion.

HD, a Thailand-based healthtech firm touted as the “Airbnb for surgeries,” appears to have hit a growth curve last year. In January, it secured US$6 million in funding and, a few months later, it raised another round of fresh capital to enter Vietnam.
Now the 2019-founded startup is looking to develop an AI-powered conversational chatbot focused on the healthcare space.
To that end, the company has banked US$5.6 million in a series A funding round led by SBI Ven Capital, a subsidiary of Japanese financial services major SBI Group, through its joint fund with Kyobo Securities from South Korea and NTU Singapore’s NTUitive.
Other investors include M Venture Partners, Febe Ventures, Partech Partners, Ratio Ventures, Orvel Ventures, and TA Ventures.
The chatbot would handle regular customer questions, freeing up human staff for complex issues while helping ensure that customer service is available around the clock.
“In emerging Southeast Asian markets, the real opportunity for healthcare AI lies not in building yet another general practitioner chatbot, but in enhancing patient outcomes by streamlining operational and administrative tasks for providers and payers,” said co-founder Sheji Ho – previously a co-founder and CMO at ecommerce enabler aCommerce – in a statement.
HD also said it plans to train this chatbot with its wealth of anonymized data from healthcare products, transactions, and chat commerce.
According to TechCrunch, HD plans to launch the service within three months for its HDmall marketplace, and eventually offer the chatbot to third parties – such as hospitals and clinics – by year-end.
Ho said in the TechCrunch interview that HD was already on pace to hit profitability after the pandemic, so it didn’t see the need to raise funding at first. But he said that “if we raise now then everything else will be cheaper,” highlighting lower rates in customer and talent acquisition following the recent trend of layoffs and other companies’ decreases in advertising budgets.
The advent of more accessible AI capabilities, brought on by the success of companies like OpenAI, has already changed the trajectory of healthtech. Morgan Stanley predicted that companies will set aside 11% of their healthcare budgets on average in AI tech this year – be it for improvements in diagnostics, drug discovery, and physician-patient engagement.

BillEase, a Philippines-based buy now, pay later player, said it doubled its revenue in 2023 to US$57 million compared to the year before.
It also stayed profitable with US$7 million in net income for the full year – a relatively steep rise from last August. The company, which was founded by former executives of McKinsey, had said at the time that it was in the black with around US$1.5 million in net profit.
BillEase said it is now gearing up for a series C funding round. Its last financing came two years ago, in a US$11 million series B round led by Burda Principal Investments.
“Our success in 2023 can be attributed to three key factors: offering a top-priority product for our customers (lending with good terms), building long-term relationships with our partners and customers, and maintaining efficient operations and risk management,” said CEO Georg Steiger in a statement.
BillEase’s customer base grew to 800,000 in 2023 from 650,000 the year before. The firm also posted a 47% return on equity by end-2023 – outpacing what traditional banks in the Philippines achieved on average.
Besides BNPL, the company also offers personal loans, e-wallet top-ups, bill payments, and gaming credits, among other services.
Aside from rolling out new products, among BillEase’s upcoming plans are to recruit top-level executives as well as integrate AI more deeply into its operations. Last year, the company said its partnership with companies like Alipay+ and Agoda has helped push its merchant network to grow over 3x to 10,000.
BillEase’s financial results come amid a slow start for BNPL in 2024. The first quarter of the year saw several exits from the space in Southeast Asia, including Bukalapak’s BukaCicilan and ShopBack’s PayLater.
However, two major players remain bullish on the business model: GoTo and TikTok Shop, fresh off the latter’s acquisition of Tokopedia, are looking to launch a BNPL service soon.

Colorful signages as far as the eye can see, unfettered access to an engaged and high-quality audience, and the opportunity to network with potential business partners and investors are all part of the experience. It’s no wonder trade shows like Tech in Asia’s Startup Factory – also known as Startup Showcase at our upcoming Saigon Summit – are so popular among early-stage startups.

But the reality is that running a booth at a conference is no simple task. Those who go into it unprepared might end up standing around while crowds flock to more experienced exhibitors right beside them.
To even out the playing field, we’ve put together our top advice for exhibitors who want to stand out from the competition. Based on our experience organizing Startup Factory every year, here are the three tips you need to know to run a successful booth at the next conference you attend.
1. Get people engaged
This cannot be stressed enough: Booths where people just pitch their startup’s products or services are so boring.
No one goes to a conference or trade show to hear a spiel, much less from a company they’d never heard of before.


Exhibitors at Tech in Asia Jakarta 2023’s Startup Factory. / Photo credit: Tech in Asia

Instead, create an experience for those who stop by your exhibition. Got a cool translation app that understands several slang words and accents? Let attendees try it out. Revolutionizing the logistics process at a warehouse? Consider equipping your booth with a virtual reality headset and giving people a peek into how different a warehouse could look.
Get creative. It’ll ensure that everyone who visits your booth remembers you – it might even make them spread the word to their network.
2. Choose your booth representatives carefully
Some companies might be tempted to leave their exhibitions in the hands of interns or junior staff. After all, senior employees have more work on their plates and might not have the time to stand at a booth all day. All it takes is for the interns to memorize lines and regurgitate them to everyone who passes by, right?
Wrong. The best people to engage with at a conference are decision-makers and leaders. That’s why it makes more sense to have the decision-makers and leaders from your company represent your business.

On top of that, consider the fact that more seasoned employees understand your startup’s products and services better than someone who was only onboarded recently. Letting experienced staff members man your booth ensures that they can answer visitors’ questions confidently on the spot.
It’s also a good idea to get your more charismatic people into the spotlight. After all, they’re going to leave a better impression than someone who isn’t used to large crowds.
3. Work doesn’t stop at the end of the conference
Just because the conference is over and your booth has been torn down doesn’t mean you should just slide back into business as usual. On the contrary, the work has only just begun.
Aside from having to follow up on all the leads you’ve collected during the event, it’s equally crucial that you do a retrospective of your booth’s performance. Check how your exhibition’s engagement measures up against the goals you’d set prior to the event and make sure to tie those metrics back to your business objectives.
After that, it’s an iterative process of tweaking your booth strategy so that your next trade show experience is better than the last.

Want to put these tips into practice? The first run of Tech in Asia’s signature trade show for 2024, Startup Showcase, will take place on May 30 at our upcoming Saigon Summit. Don’t miss this opportunity to get in front of some of the region’s leading tech and startup professionals and investors.

841906,2024-04-03T01:00:13,2024-03-28T02:28:56,This Singapore aquafarm takes to AI like fish to water,singapore-aquafarm-ai-fish-water,publish,post,https://www.techinasia.com/singapore-aquafarm-ai-fish-water,"Faced with space constraints and rising costs, Singapore-based aquaculture company The Fish Farmer is using sensors and artificial intelligence to farm fish more efficiently.
“It’s very challenging to grow fish in Singapore as there are many competing uses for sea space,” says founder and CEO Malcolm Ong in an interview with The Business Times. “So if you have limited space, then you have to think of innovative ways of growing fish using technology.”

Established in 2007, The Fish Farmer operates four farms located in the waters off Changi and Lim Chu Kang. It produces about 1,000 tonnes of fish annually, including species such as milkfish, garoupa, and red snapper.
The rising costs of fish farming have fueled the need for productivity improvements, says Ong.
Compared to pre-pandemic times, overall fish farming costs have gone up by about 25%, according to the CEO. These include the cost of labor, raw materials, transport, feed and baby fish fry.
Tracking fish inventory accurately
While industries such as manufacturing can turn to automation and robotics to improve productivity, this is out of the question for fish farms based in the sea, says Ong.
“Seawater is very corrosive, so things don’t last. Even if you put in a lot of equipment, something will fail after three months,” he explains.
Any form of technology being used on a farm would also need to have low energy consumption and be able to run off a battery or a similar standalone power source, as sea-based farms are not connected to any electricity source, he adds.
With these considerations in mind, Ong spent the last decade developing an IoT farm management software for The Fish Farmer.
This was done with help from information technology solutions provider Metropolitan Wireless International (MWI) – a separate company that Ong founded in 2009 but does not manage.
The IoT software, which runs on the cloud, is linked to physical sensors located in his four farms. The sensors run on solar power and thus do not need to be connected to the power grid.
Each sensor monitors different aspects of the farm environment, from the water quality in the tanks of live fish to the temperature of cold rooms and chiller facilities where harvested fish are stored.
Real-time data captured by these sensors is fed back to a central digital dashboard, giving farm employees a comprehensive overview of the conditions in each farm at any given point in time.
“Our earlier versions only contained basic functions. We’ve had to redesign the software to add on new applications along the way,” says Ong.
For instance, Ong recently worked with MWI to create an AI-based fish counting application that would allow The Fish Farmer to track its inventory across its farms.
Previously, Ong’s employees had to pull up nets of fish and manually count them – a process that was not only time-consuming and labor-intensive, but also prone to human error.
This often led to inaccurate estimates of fish stock, says Ong.
“We may think we have 10,000 fish at the start, but it turns out that we only have 7,000, because some fish may escape or die along the way. So we end up communicating the wrong number of fish supplies to our customers,” he shares.

To track fish inventory, farm employees simply need to record videos of fish swimming across a net, then upload them to the cloud. / Photo credit: The Fish Farmer

With the new AI-powered application, fish counting can now be carried out more frequently and accurately across his farms.
Farm employees simply need to record videos of fish swimming across a net, then upload them to the cloud. The software will analyze the videos and automatically count the number of fish on screen.
The software is also able to measure the length of each fish in uploaded videos, thus helping employees to monitor if the fish are growing well, says Ong.
Keeping tabs on water conditions
Ong has also worked with MWI to develop an improved water quality monitoring sensor.
The previous version of the sensor, rolled out in 2014, could only measure dissolved oxygen levels in the water.
In December 2023, the sensor was upgraded to include more parameters, such as acidity and turbidity levels, oxidation reduction potential, barometric pressure, and water temperature.
Farm employees are now alerted whenever the sensor detects any changes in water conditions, allowing them to quickly take action to save the fish, explains Ong.
This has allowed The Fish Farmer to significantly reduce incidents where its fish stocks were depleted due to adverse water conditions. Such wipeouts used to occur at least six to seven times a year.
“By collecting the right data, we can manage our farms better and reduce farming risk. The data coming in allows us to react a lot faster to any problems that arise,” says Ong.

Farm employees are alerted and can quickly take action to save the fish whenever the sensor detects any changes in water conditions. / Photo credit: The Fish Farmer

These technologies have also freed up farm employees’ time for higher-value tasks, he adds. The Fish Farmer plans to send some workers to take up a diploma in aquaculture management and technology at Temasek Polytechnic, so they can learn more about fish behavior and water quality.
“Many traditional fish farms have a lot of experience in the trade, but they may not have the know-how to implement the right tech that works for them,” says Ong. “We’re fortunate to be able to adapt our technology to fit our farm conditions, increasing our production of fish in the process.”

Southeast Asia is betting big on electric vehicle exports. Vietnam-based VinFast is expanding heavily, setting up a manufacturing plant in India and targeting the global market.
Meanwhile, Singapore-based Scorpio Electric is also upping its global game, saying that it has chosen distributors in Japan, Spain, Portugal, and the Philippines. These distributors will facilitate sales for the Scorpio Electric X1 maxi-scooter, the firm’s first EV.
These countries were selected based on factors such as their sizable two-wheeler customer base and rising demand for electric transport, according to Joshua Goh, Scorpio Electric’s CEO.
To prepare for the launch, Scorpio Electric has engaged with local officials in each target market to ensure regulatory approval. Production and delivery for the X1 bike will start in late 2024, the firm said.
The company plans to strengthen existing partnerships and seek new growth opportunities in these markets. In January 2023, the EV brand raised US$6.5 million at a US$150 million valuation.
However, the startup’s losses increased by over 15% to S$3.3 million (US$2.4 million) in the financial year ended March 2023.
Notably, Joel CY Chang, who was the COO at Scorpio Electric, has since moved on to start another Singapore e-motorcycle firm Charged Asia. As of June last year, the company had rolled out 1,000 bikes, focusing on the Indonesian market, and said it was slated to hit profitability by the end of 2023.

GRC – which stands for governance, risk, and compliance – has increasingly become more complicated to tackle given the rapid adoption of generative AI.
More companies involve genAI in their operations, yet the tech can be a hit or miss with the info it generates. Moreover, massive layoffs in the cybersecurity sector poke more holes for potential bad actors to go through.
This is a trend US- and India-based Scrut Automation said it has been seeing lately. This is also a problem it aims to help solve for tech-first mid-market businesses through its services, which focus on risk management as well as customer control and monitoring.
To help Scrut Automation reach more clients, the company recently raised US$10 million from existing backers Lightspeed, MassMutual Ventures, and Endiya Partners.
The funds will be used to bolster Scrut Automation’s platform and finance its expansion into Europe and North America. It also plans to implement AI solutions to lessen manual work from risk and compliance staff.
Established in 2021, Scrut Automation has secured a total of US$20.5 million in funding. Its platform, which is powered by automation and gives users unified control, allows quick views into risk and compliance for GRC teams.
“A core unique selling proposition for Scrut is offering an extremely high degree of flexibility in creating GRC programs that fit closely with the customer’s environment,” said Aayush Ghosh Choudhury, co-founder and CEO of Scrut Automation, in a statement.
The platform doesn’t offer a one-size-fits-all solution. Instead, Scrut allows organizations to tailor their GRC programs, aiming to address their exact pain points and align with industry standards.
The company said it has helped over 800 global clients create industry-grade GRC systems for themselves. These clients include equity management platform Qapita and customer engagement platform MoEngage.

Indonesia is the world’s second-biggest fish producer after China. Every year, the Southeast Asian country’s fish farms churn out about 6 million tons of fish, valued at around US$30 billion.
This opportunity has led to the rise of many new aquaculture tech startups in Indonesia, including unicorn eFishery.
FishLog, another startup in this space, has raised undisclosed funding in a pre-series A extension round, with investors including Accel, Insignia Ventures Partners, and Saison Capital.
With Mandiri Capital Indonesia and BNI Ventures also participating, this round makes FishLog the only startup to secure investments from three Indonesian state-owned banks, the company said in a statement.
BRI Ventures – also a VC arm of a government-owned bank – took part in FishLog’s previous pre-series A round in 2022.
The latest fundraise will boost FishLog’s cold chain ecosystem with a large share going toward the distribution of FishLog’s traceable seafood in the US, a market the firm entered in 2023. FishLog said it has distributed over 60,000 kilograms of seafood to the country since then.
Founded in 2020, FishLog works as an enabler for fisheries. It offers services like FishLog Trace, which makes sure that seafood comes from responsible sources, and FishLog Smart Contract, which handles financing and enhances aquaculture supply chain transparency.
The startup said it has linked up with over 60 buyers globally. It also claimed to have increased cold storage productivity by 40% through sustainable supply and technology, handling over 4,000 tons of seafood inventory monthly.
In December 2023, FishLog also received a grant of US$100,000 from the United Nations Development Programme and Indonesia’s Finance Ministry.
The grant will support initiatives like enhancing the financial literacy of fisher families, providing character education for fishers’ children, and encouraging mangrove planting for global carbon tracking in the fishing industry.

VinFast vehicles are set to hit Indonesian roads, as the Vietnamese EV firm is opening one of its first dealerships in the country.
Run by Gallerie Setia Utama, the showroom – which will be built in Depok City, west of Jakarta – highlights VinFast’s VF 5 and VF e34 electric vehicles.
This marks one of the first steps in VinFast’s plan to establish a strong presence across Indonesia’s major cities by 2024.
Indonesia, which has had growing consumer demand for EVs, also has lofty ambitions of its own. It aims to produce roughly 600,000 EV units in the country. This is about 100x the number of electric vehicle sales in Indonesia for the first half of last year.
By 2024, VinFast wants to establish a presence in at least 50 countries. It is actively growing its footprint in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, alongside established markets like the US, Canada, and Europe.
To support this global growth, the company aims to create new EV factories in the US, India, and Indonesia. Recently, the firm announced the construction of a US$500 million EV factory in India, with an annual capacity of up to 150,000 units.
The startup, which offers a battery subscription service alongside its car sales, also recently signed agreements with 15 auto dealers in Thailand at the 2024 Bangkok International Motor Show.

Hello reader,
For as long as I’ve lived in Hanoi, used motorbikes have been my primary mode of transport.
Buying pre-owned motorbikes with my limited Vietnamese language skills and even more limited knowledge of what makes a good scooter had led to some poor decisions. For instance, for years I drove what a friend described as a “Franken-bike” because it was cobbled together from pieces of various bikes and broke down constantly.
Now, though, I drive a pretty reliable semi-automatic. What’s made all the difference is that I bought it from a friend’s mechanic, who has been happy to make any repairs I need.
I guess what I was missing before was a little bit of aftersales care, so it’s no big surprise to me that secondhand-car marketplace Carro has seen big growth in that and other ancillary parts of its business.
Though as today’s featured story dives into, the Singapore-based company’s big revenue jump was largely driven by its core marketplace arm.
Today we look at:


Carro’s revenue surge 
Chinese tech major Xiaomi launching its first electric car
Other newsy highlights such as OpenAI planning to open its first Asian office in Tokyo and VC firm GGV Capital rebranding its Asian operations to Granite Asia.


Premium summary
Carro’s revenue drive

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Carro has posted some solid results for the financial year ended March 31, 2023, headlined by a 67% revenue jump.
The company’s revenue hit S$1.1 billion (US$818 million), as sales continued to rise and its investments in other areas like financing, insurance, and aftersales bloomed.


Bread and butter: About 90% of that revenue came from the company’s core marketplace unit, Carro CFO Ernest Chew told Tech in Asia. However, the highest growth was seen in ecosystem-led ancillaries like financing, mobility, insurance, and aftersales, he added.

By the numbers: It wasn’t all rosy results for Carro though, as losses after tax soared to US$94 million in FY 2023 from US$6.7 million the year before. Unrealized strategic investment losses were part of the reason. “One of our acquisitions has had its assets significantly revalued upward, but ironically had negatively impacted our P&amp;L (e.g., higher depreciation, reversal of fair value uplift) in the short term,” explained Chew.

In the green: Carro recorded positive adjusted EBITDA for the year at US$3 million and the company appears on track to surpass that in 2024. The figure for the first quarter of FY 2024 was US$11 million, the firm’s highest-ever quarterly profit.

News spotlight
Xiaomi hits the road

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Xiaomi is the latest Chinese company to join the electric vehicle race, as it has officially launched sales of the SU7, the firm’s first EV.
Within the first half hour of the release, 50,000 SU7 units were bought.


Heating up: Xiaomi has priced the base model at about US$29,880, reported the South China Morning Post. This price point would put it in competition with established Chinese EV players such as BYD, Nio, and Xpeng, as well as Tesla.

Pedal to the metal: While the Chinese government has gradually withdrawn subsidies for EV manufacturers, the industry is still growing. The country’s EV and plug-in hybrid market is predicted to rise by 22% year on year in 2024, reaching 11 million vehicles. 

First China and then?: Other Chinese firms such as BYD and Wuling are battling for market share in Southeast Asia, but it’s unclear if Xiaomi will enter the fray. The region’s EV sales are projected to land between US$80 billion and US$100 billion by 2035, according to estimates from EY.

For the first time, global crypto exchange firm Binance has named a board of directors, which is led by Gabriel Abed, who is the ex-Barbados ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, Bloomberg reported.
Abed will serve as chairman, with Binance CEO Richard Teng and senior executives Heina Chen, Jinkai He, and Lilai Wang serving as members.
Additional board members include Arnaud Ventura, managing partner at investment firm Gojo &amp; Co, as well as Xin Wang, CEO of Bayview Acquisition Corp. All of these appointments became effective on March 7.
Binance appointed Teng as CEO in November, following founder Changpeng Zhao’s resignation after pleading guilty to anti-money laundering charges in the US. Zhao agreed to step down as CEO of the crypto exchange as part of a US$4.3 billion settlement with the US Department of Justice.
Since it was founded in China in 2017, Binance claimed to operate without a global headquarters. However, Teng has expressed a desire to adopt a more conventional corporate structure, which includes establishing a headquarters and forming a board of directors.
Last month, Zhao unveiled his new project called Giggle Academy, a platform that provides education for grades one to 12 learners. It is also a zero-revenue platform that uses AI and automation and is fully online.
The former CEO is currently awaiting a criminal trial, which has been postponed to April 30.

Malaysia Venture Capital Management (Mavcap) aims to increase its VC investments from US$758 million to US$1.4 billion.
With this, Mavcap said it aims to help boost its contribution to Malaysia’s GDP from 0.19% to 0.35%.
The initiative is part of the firm’s 2024-2030 Malaysia Venture Capital Roadmap (MVCR), backed by the country’s Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation.
The MVCR targets three areas: funding, regulatory reform, and expanding capacity, all aligned with Malaysia’s goal to be an innovative and inclusive economy.
It underscores strategic investment from government and private sectors into areas key to Malaysia’s economic growth and calls for transparent governance, The New Straits Times reported. This includes policy measures and development plans to create a better regulatory environment for VC projects.
Currently, Malaysia lags behind neighboring Singapore in VC funding. In 2022, Singapore’s VC funding amounted to US$9.5 billion compared to Malaysia’s US$758 million, according to Mavcap COO Noor Amy Ismail.
That said, Ismail highlighted Malaysia’s growth potential. She cited the country’s compound annual growth rate of 44%, which is far higher than Singapore’s 13.1%.

Hi there,
This past week, there were many public holidays across the region, which means my colleagues and I had some time off. That’s given me a chance to run outdoors.
Since I’m returning to running, I’m still trying to figure out my best pace. In my last run, thanks to my new pair of shoes, I thought I could handle five kilometers in less than 40 minutes (it’s not the toughest goal, I know).
Still, that confidence cost me. I ended up running just four kilometers and was gasping for air in the last five minutes.
In this week’s Big Story, my colleague Emmanuel spotlights Malaysian healthtech startup Naluri, which shows that companies too can run out of breath from time to time. Having landed fresh capital in 2022, it expanded swiftly into Thailand and quickly ran out of steam.
It found success in the early days of the pandemic as Malaysian corporations availed of its physical and mental health assistance services to help their struggling employees. But by 2023, as the tech winter persisted, it was apparent that Naluri could not keep up with the pace of expansion.
Emmanuel speaks with Naluri’s CEO, Azran Osman-Rani, on how the company plans to run at a pace it can sustain and its aim to break even by the end of the year.
Speaking of races, I explore how a superteam of tech giants – including Google, Intel, and Qualcomm – plan to overtake Nvidia in the race for AI dominance in this week’s AI Odyssey.
But first, this week’s Big Story.

THE BIG STORY
Despite setbacks, this Malaysian healthtech firm eyes EBITDA breakeven by year-end

After laying off about a third of its staff, Kuala Lumpur-based health tech startup Naluri is ready once more to grow its business to profitability.

AI ODYSSEY
Can a superteam of tech giants take on Nvidia?
Harvard Business School economist Michael Porter pioneered the idea that for a business to flourish, it must have a competitive advantage. That can come in two forms: a cost advantage or a differentiation advantage.
The former may be easy to achieve for some industries (e.g. fast fashion), but in the realm of artificial intelligence, if a chip is not from Nvidia, companies probably wouldn’t use it even if it’s cheap.
Nvidia, known for its graphics processingor units (GPUs) which are used for developing generative AI models, has taken an enviable 80% market share of the AI chip computing space. That is despite its AI chips selling for as much as US$40,000 each.
In contrast, AI chips of its lagging rival, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), are estimated to be sold for US$15,000.

But beyond providing the GPUs to power AI, Nvidia has fostered a large community of AI developers that build consistently using the company’s products.
Its monopoly in AI chips has apparently become too much for the world’s biggest tech giants, as they are now banding together to develop an AI software that can run even without Nvidia’s chips, network, or software.
A coalition of Google as well as chipmakers Intel and Qualcomm, called the UXL Foundation, plans to develop open-source software and tools that would allow tech companies to develop and run machine -learning algorithms that can be used with any chip.
You see, when Nvidia thought of a “differentiation advantage,” it thought about everything an AI company could ever need. It has the chip, it has the network where its advanced chips can connect to, and more importantly, it has the software that developers use to fine-tune their AI models.
Reuters reports the coalition aims to “mature” its plans in the second half of 2024. The question is, will it work?
It’s not the first time an entity has tried to unseat Nvidia from its throne as the king of AI tech. Both Google and Intel have their own AI chips, for example.
But software that can take on Nvidia may be a harder undertaking. After all, developers specializing in AI models have been using its software for the last 15 years.
Even its next closest competitor in the AI chip race, AMD, has not managed to compete against Nvidia’s software, Cuda – a platform with tools to help developers build AI models and apps. AMD has been funneling millions of dollars to develop software that can take on its rival’s.
Still, if UXL Foundation’s goal does flourish, it can be a win not just for developers but for economies worldwide. Just take a look at how mobile app developers in the European Union managed to bring the giant that is Apple to its knees and made it reduce its in-app fees on the App Store.
A similar effort on AI may not necessarily mean cheaper chips, but it would definitely increase access to a technology that could make or break economies in the near future. That is a win in our books.

Grab has announced that it will cease support for its GrabPay Card, both digital and physical, from June 1, 2024.
Since April 1, the super app has stopped accepting new GrabPay Card applications, while users still have until April 30 to request a replacement card if needed.
Meanwhile, users’ GrabRewards points and the GrabPay Wallet balance won’t be affected once the card service ends. Points will stay valid if users make at least one points-earning transaction each month.
The company launched GrabPay Card services in 2019, as part of its partnership with the payment giant Mastercard. The services were first rolled out in Singapore, and then the Philippines, followed by other Southeast Asian countries.
“We have observed much higher adoption and use of other Grab offerings (such as PayLater by Grab, GrabPay Wallet) that better cater to the needs of our users,” Grab said in a statement.
For that reason, the company plans to focus on “refining these products to provide an even better user experience.”
While it has closed its door for its card offering, Grab recently partnered with crypto payments provider Triple-A to for the GrabPay app in Singapore.
The tie-up enabled Grab to add support for e-wallet top-ups using digital tokens. The new feature supports major coins like bitcoin, ethereum, USDC, and USDT, as well as XSGD, a blockchain-powered stablecoin linked to the Singapore dollar.

Photo credit: Carousell Group

Carousell Group, a major player in Southeast Asia’s classifieds space, has expanded its luxury segment by acquiring LuxLexicon, a Singapore-based reseller of luxury bags.
The move is aimed at strengthening Carousell’s luxury offerings and improving the customer experience across its channels.
The luxury resale sector in Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, and Taiwan is expected to grow significantly and reach a market value of US$7.5 billion by 2026, Carousell said, citing research from RedSeer Strategy Consultants. The company said it has seen a surge in its high-end bag listings, with an increase of 71% per month over the last two years.
This enhanced focus on luxury goods may help take Carousell closer to its goal of growing its users by 10x.
To make buying and selling luxury bags more reliable and user-friendly, Carousell launched two initiatives in 2023.
The Carousell Certified Luxury program, which verifies the authenticity of high-end bags, has seen a fourfold increase in transactions. The Sell to Carousell Luxury service, meanwhile, allows users to sell or consign their bags to Carousell and has also seen a significant surge in interest.
These launches follow the appointment of Gijs Verheijke – ex-CEO and founder of Singapore fashion platform Ox Street – as the head of Carousell’s luxury segment in January 2023. Carousell acquired Ox Street, a marketplace for high-end sneakers, in October 2021.
However, Verheijke has since moved to head Carousell’s experience and marketplace experience teams, while co-founder Marcus Tan sits at the helm of Carousell’s luxury arm.
By integrating LuxLexicon into its business, Carousell hopes to leverage its expertise in the luxury bag market, particularly in resale and consignment. LuxLexicon will retain its brand and continue to operate independently, with founder Florence Low at its helm.
The company’s other acquisitions include Laku6, an electronics recommerce platform in Indonesia, and Refash, a fashion-focused marketplace in Singapore.
Carousell has established a regional headquarters, known as Carousell Campus, to further develop its recommerce capabilities and consolidate its various brands.

Joseph Schooling, Singapore’s first-ever Olympic gold medalist, has announced his retirement from competitive swimming and is now striving for gold in another area: venture capital investing.
Schooling is now a founding partner at Swaen Schooling Capital, along with investment banker Cliff Go and serial entrepreneur Ben Ling.
“I am eager to explore new passions, face different challenges, and see where this next phase of life takes me,” Schooling wrote in his retirement announcement on Instagram.
Based on Go’s LinkedIn profile, Swaen Schooling Capital was established in August 2022. Go himself had previously founded his own fund management firm, Swaen Capital, in 2011.
With Swaen Schooling Capital, the team focuses on early-stage investments in three areas: impact and sustainability, sports and wellness, and tech. The firm is also open to opportunities to create “original businesses in-house” or form strategic joint-venture partnerships.
To date, there have been no announcements of investments made by the VC firm.
However, Schooling has previously invested in the pre-seed round of the Singapore-based mental health startup Huddleverse in May 2023, according to Crunchbase. It is unclear whether this investment was made through Swaen Schooling Capital or as an angel investor.
Impact and sustainability have become a focus for investors in Southeast Asia recently. Companies such as Temasek, East Ventures, Openspace, and Wavemaker have invested in startups operating in this field.

Photo credit: Grab

The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) was said to have reviewed the now-collapsed acquisition of Foodpanda by Grab in January, Reuters reported.
It was reported in September 2023 that Delivery Hero was considering selling part of its Southeast Asian operations, including the Foodpanda brand, in which Grab was a prospective buyer.
In February this year, Delivery Hero said it exited discussions with “the main negotiating counterpart.” In its earnings call in the same month, Grab said that it had no plans to pursue any acquisitions.
The CCCS discontinued its review of the deal following these announcements.
If an acquisition of Foodpanda had taken place, it would have further fortified Grab’s position in Southeast Asia’s food delivery market, where the latter already holds a 55% market share.
Grab is already under the radar of the CCCS for its Trans-cab acquisition, which would give the ride-hailing firm access to over 2,200 taxis and more than 300 private-hire vehicles. It announced its planned acquisition of the taxi operator in July 2023.
The deal is still under in-depth review by the CCCS to assess its effect on the Singapore market.

Indonesia-based ecommerce major Blibli reduced its loss from operations by 28.4% in the 2023 fiscal year, even as it posted a roughly 4% year-on-year decline in net revenue – which landed at 14.7 trillion rupiah (US$924 million).
The losses, which improved on the back of better finance costs, stood at US$225 million for 2023.
According to the company, the net revenue decline was due to its strategy to optimize its total processing value (TPV) mix “by putting more focus on more profitable product selections across categories in the first-party retail segment.”
Blibli generates its revenue from first-party retail, third-party retail, corporate customers, and physical stores.
Of this mix, only first-party retail – which refers to its B2C ecommerce sales – saw a decline in net revenue for FY 2023, which dropped 28% year on year to US$401 million. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, the net revenue for this category dropped 59% to US$60 million.
Meanwhile, net revenue from the third-party retail segment – which serves sellers who use Blibli’s ecommerce platform and Tiket.com, its online travel agent (OTA) platform – surged 466% during the period to US$70 million.
Blibli’s overall TPV grew 17%, backed by enhanced performance in the OTA segment of the third-party retail sector, as well as improved performance in consumer electronics stores.
The company also improved its take rate from 4.2% in FY 2022 to 5.1% in FY 2023.
“Central to our profitability strategy was optimization of our product mix, prioritizing higher-margin products and aligning third-party seller rates with our profitability road map,” stated Kusumo Martanto, Blibli’s CEO and co-founder.
The company’s shares, listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BELI, ended Monday at 474 rupiah (US$0.02), up slightly from March 28.

Malaysia-based Jaya Grocer has partnered with earned-wage access (EWA) provider Paywatch, which will provide its service to the supermarket chain’s 3,100 employees.
EWA offerings let employees access a portion of their earned salary before their scheduled paydays, usually to help manage unforeseen expenses.
Since Grab’s acquisition of Jaya Grocer, the grocery startup has launched features to onboard more consumers. These include a membership program, which allows customers to earn and redeem GrabRewards points at Jaya Grocer stores across Malaysia.
Paywatch, which is backed by Gobi Partners, operates in Indonesia, the Philippines, South Korea, Hong Kong, as well as Malaysia. It claims that its solution can reduce employee turnover by up to 40%, improving a company’s productivity.
“Paywatch helps employers cultivate great workplaces and supports their efforts in alleviating money-related stress and distractions for employees so that people can thrive professionally and personally,” said Alex Kim, the firm’s co-founder and president.
Paywatch currently competes with companies like GajiGesa and Wagely. The latter recently secured US$23 million after hitting 1 million salary disbursements since its launch in 2020.

Hello readers,
I’ve taken up several leadership positions when I was younger. It always feels strange at first when people look to you to make a decision, knowing that the path you choose can strongly influence those around you.
In my younger days, I don’t think I fully grasped the scope of this responsibility. It wasn’t just about making decisions for other people, but also being responsible for their welfare. As such, I made some mistakes, and I had to learn the hard way that leadership also meant that the buck stops with you.
Having experienced just a tiny bit of what being a leader entails, I can get a glimpse of what it would be like amplified 10x or 100x in the context of company CEOs.
Suddenly, you’re not just affecting a dozen or two people, but potentially hundreds or even thousands of workers whose livelihoods depend on you. That’s why after reading today’s premium story, I’ve gained a lot more insight into – and respect for – Patrick Walujo, CEO of GoTo Group
After some grueling efforts, the Indonesian firm has finally posted its first profitable quarter. Read on to find out how Walujo played a significant role in that achievement.
Today we look at:

How GoTo got its first quarterly profit

Premium summary
GoTo’s own North Star

Reading through this story, it’s evident that a lot of tough choices had to be made. It seems that in business, there’s really no room for sentimentality. If something’s got to change for the good of the company, then it has to be done – and the hardest choices require the strongest wills.


Started from the bottom: In Q2 2023, GoTo recorded a net loss of US$216 million, with an adjusted EBITDA of negative US$79 million. Two quarters later, the firm hit profitability on an adjusted basis – the first time it has ever done so. 

Cutting loose: Patrick Walujo was appointed as GoTo’s CEO in June 2023. Just two months after that, the firm sold two of its units: GoPlay, its entertainment business, and Loket, a ticketing platform. Later that year, it sold 75% of ecommerce firm Tokopedia to TikTok. 

The first step: While recent efforts have borne fruit, GoTo isn’t completely in the clear yet. For one, the firm’s share price – at US$0.43 as of March 25 – isn’t great. Further, Walujo is also reportedly acting as CEO temporarily, as he’s still serving as managing partner of private equity firm Northstar Group.

It seems like leadership roles are a bit of a theme in today’s newsletter. Golden Gate Ventures has appointed Angela Toy as its new COO. She was previously the firm’s partner for portfolio growth. Now, she’s got the chance to spur growth across the entire organization.


The OG: Toy is no stranger to the VC firm, having joined as employee number two when it was founded in 2011. 

Here and there and everywhere: Before she became a partner in 2021, Toy donned many roles in Golden Gate Ventures. These include head of operations and finance as well as the director of portfolio strategy and operations. 

A very COOl role: As COO, Toy will manage operations and support expansion initiatives.

Shein has logged a significant profit increase for 2023, earning more than US$2 billion – a substantial rise from the US$700 million net income recorded in 2022, the Financial Times reported, citing a financial document.
The company’s gross merchandise value, which reflects the total sales on its platform, reached around US$45 billion in 2023.
With these improvements, the ultra-fast fashion company’s financial performance has outpaced some of its industry counterparts, including H&amp;M. The latter posted profits of US$820 million, the report noted.
Shein is in the process of seeking a regulatory green light for an IPO. The company reportedly believes the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would not approve its listing plans in New York. The downturn in Hong Kong’s financial market, which has affected fundraising opportunities, also casts doubt on the possibility of an IPO there.
For these reasons, Shein is looking to move its market debut to London, the reported said.
Shein’s operations, while headquartered in Singapore, are still heavily reliant on its Chinese roots, with a significant number of employees based in China. In February, US Senator Marco Rubio asked the SEC to block Shein’s attempt at going public, saying the company had to provide more information on its Chinese operations, among other issues.

ChatGPT developer OpenAI is set to launch its first Asian office in Tokyo, reported Nikkei Asia, citing sources.
OpenAI will likely hire local talent for the Japan-based office, which will offer customer support to companies using its technology.
Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, had met Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in Tokyo last year, expressing interest in the region. At the time, Altman pledged to work with the Japanese government to protect user privacy and safety.
As AI gets widespread global attention, numerous countries are vying to secure a share of the generative AI pie.
Singapore’s Temasek Holdings is reportedly in early-stage discussions to invest in OpenAI. This follows the city-state’s efforts to become an Asian AI powerhouse, having set aside roughly US$742 million for investments in the sector.
Altman is also in talks with the government of the United Arab Emirates to raise funds for AI chip development.
Meanwhile, another big name making moves in the AI space is ByteDance, the company behind TikTok. The China-based firm recently posted over 100 job openings related to generative AI, with around 40 of these positions being for Singapore-based roles focusing on large language models.

Chinese tech major Xiaomi has officially joined the EV race with its maiden model, the SU7, extending its product reach beyond smartphones and electronics,
The SU7 is available in three versions: SU7, SU7 Pro, and SU7 Max, with the base model coming in at 215,900 yuan (about US$29,880), the South China Morning Post reported. This pricing would put Xiaomi in direct competition with other Chinese EV makers like BYD, Nio, and Xpeng, as well as with Elon Musk-led Tesla.
Almost 50,000 SU7 models were bought in the first half hour of its release. The launch was also livestreamed, bringing in over 10,000 pre-orders within four minutes.
At the launch, Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun likened the SU7 to Tesla’s Model 3, saying that nearly 90% of the SU7’s features outperform the Model 3 while coming in at a lower price.
China’s EV market is a battlefield not just for Xiaomi and Tesla, but also for local manufacturers. For instance, BYD has marked down prices for over 100 models, while Xpeng has discounted its best-selling G6 electric SUV.
Despite the slow rate of EV sales in China, possibly due to a gradual withdrawal of government handouts, the country’s EV and plug-in hybrid market has been persistently growing. The market is expected to increase by 22% year on year in 2024, reaching 11 million vehicles.
In Southeast Asia, meanwhile, EV sales are projected to land between US$80 billion and US$100 billion by 2035 from roughly 8.5 million unit sales, according to estimates from EY. However, it remains unknown if Xiaomi will be bringing its EV offerings to the region.
Some of the Chinese companies already vying for market share in Southeast Asia include BYD and Wuling. Tesla has also expressed its focus on the region as a priority market.

Thailand was on the map and all systems were go.
But when the rubber hit the road, that ambition came to a grinding halt.
What followed was a bittersweet 2023 for the Kuala Lumpur-based startup, which a few years ago had been earmarked as a potential unicorn by the government. Expansion plans were put on hold, and layoffs came after to the tune of more than 30% of group operations.

“It became very clear that the global VC funding environment was pretty much dried up,” Naluri co-founder Azran Osman-Rani tells Tech in Asia. The firm decided to conserve cash to preserve its runway, he explains, as board members expected that raising any money in 2023 would be “extremely slim.”
Naluri was founded in 2017 by Azran, a serial entrepreneur, and medical systems expert Jeremy Ting. Prior to Naluri, Azran was AirAsia X CEO and iFlix chief operating officer (COO).
Tiffanie Ong, who had stints at Accenture and A. T. Kearney, would join the duo in 2019 as Naluri’s COO.
The startup offers digital health coaching via an app for staff, to help them manage chronic diseases or mental health conditions. Naluri’s main aim of is to deliver positive outcomes at a lower cost to healthcare payers, particularly employers.
Now, it’s back to basics for the company. Naluri is expecting to reach EBITDA breakeven at a group level by the end of this year, Azran tells us.
Shift to mental health
Southeast Asia was the perfect place to launch Naluri as the region struggles with an epidemic of chronic noncommunicable diseases, from diabetes to heart attack. These are responsible for 60% of deaths in the region.
The reasoning was that instead of waiting for something bad to happen, patients can mitigate the risk early on, Azran explains.
At first, there was “virtually no interest in mental health,” he says. Naluri’s initial clients were looking at chronic disease management, which was their biggest recurring cost and also a major contributor to loss of productivity.
When the pandemic peaked in 2020, Naluri began getting queries from large corporations – from banks to airlines – because their employees were burning out or resigning, with some having even died due to suicide.
By 2021, all of Naluri’s work was geared toward mental healthcare, and the firm “tripled” their growth on the back of addressing mental health issues, says Azran.
Today, 70% of the cases its platform handles is related to mental health, while the rest is for chronic disease management. From its pool of corporate users, 50% are in the 20 to 29 age group.
Aside from its tech team, Naluri also hires its own psychologists, dietitians, and doctors. The firm hires locally, according to Azran, so as to better deliver programs within a user’s context.
The company also assesses a user on both the physical side – from weight to cholesterol levels – and mental side. Tools used in the latter include scores on depression, anxiety, and stress.
Uphill growth
Naluri’s pre-series B raise in 2022 was meant for expansion. The company doubled down on Singapore and Indonesia, and it ventured into Thailand. The latter was due to the participation of its strategic investor – Thai-based real estate investor Pruksa – in that round.
The big challenge with Malaysian companies, Azran says, is that startups have to expand internationally earlier compared to their Indonesian counterparts, as the country lacks a large-enough addressable market. “Because if you only stay in Malaysia, no international investor is going to pay attention to you,” he adds.
In 2022, Naluri made substantial investments in Singapore, Indonesia, and Thailand. It adopted the “typical startup mindset,” says Azran, adding that the firm now only makes hires if it has new revenue lines.
It also had to put a number of plans on the back burner, such as expanding to the Philippines and Vietnam as well as collaborating in clinical research to get the European CE safety standards mark.
Getting to EBITDA breakeven on a consolidated level will be an uphill task for Naluri.
But the company aims to finish the year on a positive note by sticking to Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia – the core businesses. Azran adds that its Thailand business could possibly break even by the end of the year.
Stuck in the middle
The biggest challenge Naluri faces is raising funds. There’s home support at the seed and later stages but not much for startups in the middle.
Aside from a small funding pool, the co-founder says Naluri had to look abroad for funding because unlike Indonesia and Thailand, there aren’t many Malaysian corporate VC firms.
The next time the company can get the backing of local institutional investors would be when it raises north of US$10 million.

Azran admits that Naluri was lucky during its seed round in 2018, as the likes of 500 Global wrote them a check. The firm’s pre-series A round in 2019 was led by Germany-based Global Founders Capital.
It was then accepted into Silicon Valley-based accelerator StartX. This has helped the firm onboard overseas investors.
Azran says the program enabled the company to cast a wide net to reel in an insurtech VC specialist in Des Moines, Iowa, which he learned is the second largest insurance hub in the US after Connecticut.
He shares that Naluri’s cap table is a good mix of VC firms and strategic investors. Examples of the latter include medical diagnostics group Pathology Asia and Japanese conglomerate Sumitomo.
Tapping a ‘new class of growth investors’
If Naluri weathers the tech winter and is able to hit its EBITDA goal, then there are three levels of growth the firm will explore, Azran says.
First, geographical expansion will be back on the table. The Philippines, Vietnam, Hong Kong, and Australia are some markets on his radar.
Second, it looks to move from big corporations to SMEs and even individuals. This will see Naluri needing to spend on digital ads, which can be costly, notes Azran.
Third, the company will be expanding the range of health conditions it can support.
“The same features we currently use for obesity or diabetes can be used for other ailments such as chronic pain or irritable bowel syndrome,” Azran explains.
He adds that it could even be used for kidney disease and cancer management.
“But this requires investing in product development, including hiring specialists. So we need more capital. Hopefully once we prove we can reach that breakeven mark, there’ll be a whole new class of growth investors we can tap into,” he says.","Naluri, which offers healthcare services for employees, tightens its belt in a move to tap into growth funding.",Emmanuel Samarathisa,Editing by collin Furtado and Lorenzo Kyle Subido,open,0,"",https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1711907966_Naluri-Management-Team.png,false,"",false,true,true,true,false,5,,1127,"Despite setbacks, Naluri eyes EBITDA breakeven by year-end","Naluri, which offers healthcare services for employees, tightens its belt in a move to tap into growth funding.",,,"","",""

Hi readers,
I always find it interesting to take a peek at financial statements, as it gives me a glimpse of a company’s inner workings. For some companies, numbers usually follow upward or downward trends for an extended period, but Bukalapak’s trajectory is marked by frequent shifts.
The Indonesian ecommerce major has seen its share of ups and downs over the past few years. For example, its net losses showed improvements in the second quarter of its 2022 financial year, but it took the company another year to finally swing into the positive. However, it posted losses again for Q3 and Q4 2023.
The firm also mostly logged quarter-on-quarter growths in revenue, but the number plateaued during Q3 2023. However, Bukalapak’s filings also showed that it was spending less and less starting from Q4 2022.
It’d be interesting to see where Bukalapak’s numbers would go soon, as competition in Indonesia’s ecommerce segment has been heating up with the blockbuster tie-up between Tokopedia and TikTok Shop. We’ll be updating our charts every quarter, so check back in with us later this year to stay informed.

Sequoia India and SEA split from its US parent firm and rebranded to Peak XV last year. Now, following the same path, GGV Capital announced that it is rebranding its Asian operations to Granite Asia.
The move comes months after GGV Capital – which is headquartered in Menlo Park – announced that it would divide its business into two different firms, with one focusing on Asia and the other on the US.
Granite Asia will aim to broaden its investment scope to include new markets and asset classes within the Asia Pacific, including Japan and Australia.
The decision was speculated to have been influenced by the growing challenges and political pressure on US companies to reduce their investments in Chinese tech.
After the rebrand, the firm will continue to manage GGV’s portfolio in Southeast Asia, China, and India.
The name Granite Asia comes from GGV Capital’s original name, Granite Global Ventures Capital. Headquartered in Singapore, the firm will be led by GGV veterans Jenny Lee and Jixun Foo, who manage a combined US$5 billion portfolio.
GGV founding partner Thomas Ng, former GIC president for special investments Teh Kok Peng, and former chairman of Singapore’s National Science and Technology Board Teo Ming Kian will act as advisors to Granite Asia. Teh and Teo both championed GGV’s establishment in Singapore back in 2000, the firm said.

Hello reader,
Have you ever used a “buy now, pay later” (BNPL) service? I’ve only done so once, back in 2020, when I was straightening my teeth with Zenyum clear aligners. I decided to pay for the treatment in installments with Hoolah.
Since then, however, it seems like BNPL has lost its shine. Hoolah was acquired by ShopBack and became ShopBack PayLater, which in turn has been discontinued.
Meanwhile, Singapore startup Pace is winding up its business, even after acquiring competitor Rely’s assets, and Australian-listed Zip has exited Singapore.
However, despite the somewhat bleak landscape, BNPL in Southeast Asia isn’t dead just yet. Today’s premium story goes deeper.
Today we look at:


Whether BNPL is really dead 
A Malaysian babycare startup that’s just raised funds 
Other newsy highlights such as Alibaba calling off Cainiao’s IPO and Mitsui &amp; Co’s investment in LinkAja 


Premium summary
Buy now, pay later, alligator

Pure-play BNPL services may be struggling, but this mode of payment isn’t dead in the water.


Eyes on ecommerce: Last July, TikTok announced it was partnering with fintech startup Atome to offer installment payment options on its ecommerce platform in Malaysia. At the same time, GoTo Financial head Thomas Husted said the fintech unit wants to be the preferred partner of TikTok Shop and is planning to deepen its consumer loan offerings on its own app. Shopee, meanwhile, plans to expand its BNPL service to all users and to offline channels as well. 

Leveraging an ecosystem: A BNPL offering as part of an ecommerce marketplace may be more viable than a standalone company providing the service. But that might not work for everyone: Bukalapak, for instance, gave up offering pay-later loans in February. BNPL works best if users already have a high propensity for spending on the platform and are tempted by incentives to increase their basket sizes.

Entry point: For ecommerce companies, BNPL is a good first step into financial services, given that it is uncomplicated and largely unregulated in Southeast Asia. TikTok Shop’s foray into BNPL could mark its entry into the fintech arena as well, seeing that the biggest ecommerce players have always evolved along this path.

Hello, baby!

Southeast Asia’s babycare segment may not be as big as India’s, but it’s nothing to sneeze at either. Applecrumby, a 12-year-old babycare brand and ecommerce platform based in Malaysia, has secured a US$4.2 million growth investment from 500 Global to help it expand globally.


Applecrumby’s story: Applecrumby was founded in 2012 by husband and wife team Sean and Jesmine Tan. They launched the firm after the birth of their daughter, as they were frustrated with the lack of safe and natural baby products available in the market.

A presence: The company currently has a presence in 11 countries, offering its affordable line of babycare products to markets like China, Vietnam, Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines. It also sells its products through online platforms like Shopee, Lazada, and TikTok Shop.

What’s next: With the new capital, Applecrumby aims to expand to more markets and be present in 20 countries by the end of the year. It will also use part of the new funds to create new products.

Carbon dioxide emissions have long been a global problem, but countries like India – which was among the top emitters last year – face a growing burden to address the issue.
One of the companies aiming to do their part to solve this issue is Bambrew, which recently raised 600 million rupees (US$7.2 million) in a series A funding round led by Blume Ventures.
Blue Ashva Capital, Mumbai Angels, and Indus Capital participated in the funding round, along with several angel investors.
Bambrew said in a statement that since its inception in 2019, the company has grown to have over 100 clients – featuring names like Amazon, Nykaa, MyGlamm, Bata, Snitch, Harris Brushes, and Mahindra Logistics.
The new capital will help enhance Bambrew’s manufacturing strength and expand its team, the company said.
It will also support Bambrew’s expansion into primary packaging for fast-moving consumer goods as well as food and drink products. This may prove to be a substantial help to the environment, as the food industry is part of the eight supply chains that contribute 50% of global emissions.
“We have saved more than 60,000 tons of single-use plastic and more than 125,000 tons of CO2 emissions by creating revolutionizing materials which are both functional and cost-efficient [compared] to plastic,” Bambrew founder Vaibhav Anant said.
Bambrew’s mission aligns with the Indian government’s efforts in encouraging companies to rethink the design of their products.
Blume Ventures partner Arpit Agarwal said that similar to how the government’s Faster Adoption and Manufacture of Electric Vehicles II subsidies helped boost the growth of electric vehicles, the Extended Producer Responsibility regulations – which include guidelines on packaging – will spur the emergence of companies that operate within a circular economy model.

Moreover, the firm disbursed more policies – its gross written premium (GWP) surged 250% during the same period.
Since its launch in 2015, PasarPolis has issued over 2 billion insurance policies. It currently offers products for life, travel, home content, logistics, electronics, and vehicle insurance, among others.
In comparison, local competitor Qoala has facilitated over 215 million policies and generated US$280 million in GWP from 2020 until now.
According to Tech in Asia’s database, PasarPolis has raised nearly US$60 million, with its latest round being a US$5 million strategic investment from International Finance Corporation in February 2021.
In 2023, the firm – which claimed to be Indonesia’s first official full-stack insurtech – noted triple-digit percentage growth month over month in its agency revenue and insurance sales, supported by its underwriting arm Tap Insure.
Now, the company said it expects a 50% compound annual growth rate over the next four years.
“Additionally, we plan to fully underwrite all our products within this period to significantly enhance our EBITDA margin,” PasarPolis founder and CEO Cleosent Randing said in the statement.
Besides Indonesia, PasarPolis also operates in Vietnam and Thailand, and so do its competitors Qoala and Fuse.
Consulting firm Redseer anticipates the insurtech industry in Indonesia to grow 4x by 2026, with a multibillion-dollar total gross premium.

Web3-focused venture fund Born Ready, launched by the co-founders of AI and metaverse platform Futureverse, is teaming up with Catalyze Research to launch the Catalyze Futureverse Ecosystem Fund.
The US$10 million investment vehicle targets new Asia-Pacific businesses in the Web3, metaverse, AI, and content sectors. Selected companies will work together within the Futureverse ecosystem, which includes blockchain platform The Root Network.
The partnership will “drive exponential growth” of The Root Network and create opportunities for startups in the region, especially those in South Korea, Born Ready wrote on X (previously Twitter).
According to data from intelligence firm Research and Markets, the spending value in South Korea’s metaverse market is expected to reach US$43.4 million by 2030.
Futureverse was founded in 2016 by Aaron McDonald and Shara Senderoff. It launched Born Ready, a US$50 million fund and venture studio, in August 2023.
In July last year, Futureverse raised US$54 million in a series A round led by 10T Holdings and joined by Ripple.
Meanwhile, Catalyze Research is a South Korea-based consulting firm focused on the blockchain industry. Established in 2017, it previously invested in Web3 projects like Matic Network (now Polygon), Biconomy, and Numbers Protocol.

FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried / Photo credit: FTX

FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was given a 25-year jail sentence for defrauding US$8 billion from customers in one of the greatest financial fraud cases in the US, a Reuters report noted.
The 32-year-old founder was found guilty on seven fraud and conspiracy counts related to FTX’s shutdown in 2022 in November last year.
Despite claiming innocence, US District Judge Lewis Kaplan noted the founder’s lack of regret, saying Bankman-Fried knew that what he was doing was illegal. “But he is not going to admit a thing, as is his right.”
The judge allowed the government to use confiscated assets to repay victims and slapped the founder with an US$11 billion forfeiture order.
While his lawyers argued for a shorter sentence, prosecutors pressed for a typical 40- to 50-year term.
Once a billionaire, worth an estimated US$26 billion, Bankman-Fried’s criminal conviction marks a major decline in his net worth.
The founder is not the only crypto mogul facing legal action in the US. Changpeng Zhao, the founder of FTX’s then-rival Binance is currently facing a lawsuit from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission for “willful evasion” of law.
In this suit, the government body alleged that Binance and its execs Zhao and chief compliance officer Samuel Lim directed employees to skirt compliance controls.
Their woes might have come at an inopportune time. After a sluggish few years, the crypto scene is currently seeing hints of a comeback – with Bitcoin recently hitting a record high value.

Amid cryptocurrency’s rise in popularity in Indonesia, a major regulatory change is imminent. The Financial Services Authority (OJK) has announced that all crypto firms seeking to operate in Indonesia will have to pass a mandatory evaluation in a regulatory sandbox.
The move comes as OJK prepares to take over crypto supervision from the Commodity Futures Trading Supervisory Agency (Bappebti) in January 2025. It also comes on the heels of Indonesia’s tightening supervision of tech companies – most recently, the government threatened to block online travel agents (OTAs) that have not registered as electronic system providers.
Hasan Fawzi, OJK’s head of financial technology supervision, emphasized the importance of safeguarding consumers and promoting informed investment decisions. The sandbox will ensure the safety and reliability of crypto services before firms receive full regulatory approval.
Companies operating without OJK’s clearance will face legal consequences. The move also suggests that under OJK, crypto assets will be treated as financial instruments, rather than commodities under Bappebti.
In Indonesia, cryptocurrency has risen in popularity. Total crypto transactions reached a remarkable US$1.92 billion last month, while the number of registered investors swelled to 19 million – with 170,000 new users came in January 2024 alone, Bappebti reported.
Aside from OTAs, TikTok Shop notably found itself banned in late 2023, which would be reversed following its acquisition of local ecommerce giant Tokopedia. Earlier that year, the government also announced plans to ban the sale of imported goods priced below US$100 on ecommerce platforms.
Meanwhile, outgoing President Joko Widodo recently issued a presidential decree that would require platforms like Meta and Google to compensate news publishers.

We break down the big and messy topics of Asia’s tech and startup community. Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a premium subscription.
Hello reader,
Call me old-fashioned, but I’m somewhat worried about the effect that generative AI (genAI) will have on kids once combined effectively with social media.
Already, it seems like social media is turning out to be hugely detrimental to young users, from body image issues to cyberbullying and even extremist, radical content. Add in an unhealthy dose of misinformation, and you’ve got a formula for potential disaster.
Of course, that’s not to say that social media is all bad. It can help people find the right community, make friends by talking about the same things they’ve seen online, and more.
But once genAI gets added to the mix, what happens then? Will we end up seeing more users turn to genAI apps and tools – instead of their friends – to beautify their online image and persona? It’s an interesting question for sure.
That said, I’m not going all doom and gloom about this. Perhaps there are opportunities for genAI to do some good in the social media space, and hopefully ByteDance’s efforts in this area turn out to be one of those healthy pushes.
Today we look at:

ByteDance’s recruitment push to boost its genAI capabilities   
A Vietnamese platform’s US$2.1 million pre-series B round
Other newsy highlights such as Canva acquiring Affinity and Hang Seng Bank launching a US$4.2 billion fund for SMEs

Unsurprisingly, ByteDance has set its sights on Singapore for its genAI push, given that the country has been a strong proponent of the technology. Let’s see if this will give the firm the leg up it’s looking for.


Lucky number 40: Out of the 100 genAI job openings ByteDance has posted, around 40 were for roles in Singapore involving large language models (LLMs). 

Testing testing 1, 2, 3: The job openings in Singapore span across different teams focused on integrating and testing out the AI capabilities of ByteDance’s offerings. They’ll be working on the firm’s own Chinese LLM as well as other genAI apps. 

FOMO: One possible factor for this move is that ByteDance has been relatively slow compared to other Chinese tech giants in terms of its progress with AI. Rivals such as Alibaba and Baidu released their own LLMs last year.

True Global Ventures (TGV) has promoted Beatrice Lion to CEO. Lion has been with the Singapore-based VC firm since 2017, having contributed to the fundraising efforts of the 4 Plus Base Fund in 2021 and the Opportunity Fund in 2022.
2️⃣ Give and take
We might have just covered how ByteDance is hiring for genAI, but other departments may not be faring as well. The Chinese firm is cutting jobs in Feishu, its corporate collaboration unit, which will affect around 1,000 workers.
Those affected will get compensation or a chance to switch to other roles in the company. Still, ByteDance might end up laying off up to 20% of Feishu’s employees in total, or over 5,000 people.
3️⃣ Maybe they felt an … affinity

Southeast Asia’s rapid growth in digitalization has had a flipside: an increase in cyberthreats. These include attacks from hacker groups like Sharp Panda, APT32, and Dark Pink, which have become more common in the region.
This presents an opportunity for the cybersecurity sector, with the market in Southeast Asia projected to reach US$4.5 billion in value this year.
One company in the space is Singapore based startup StealthMole, an AI-powered dark web intelligence company. Initially developed to help criminal investigations, the company has since found growing demand in the B2B space to mitigate cybercrime, which costs organizations in the region billions annually.
To capitalize on that, StealthMole has announced a US$7 million series A funding round. Korea Investment Partners led the round, with Hibiscus Fund and Smilegate Investment participating.
The startup will use the fresh funding to expand into new markets and further develop its technology for broader commercial applications.
StealthMole’s AI platform analyzes over 255 billion data points from the dark web, deep web, and hidden sources. This enables early threat detection, criminal tracking, and cyber incident response.
“StealthMole came about from a critical market gap I encountered while working in cybersecurity and white-hat hacking: a severe lack of data points and information networks specifically within Asia,” said co-founder Louis Hur, who co-founded the company in 2022 with fellow cybersecurity veteran Simon Choi.
Hur added that to better understand digital threats, it’s crucial “to analyze regional contexts and their impact on illicit activities.”

Using artificial intelligence avatars to sell things online has become a norm in China, but the trend is yet to be established in Southeast Asia, where it’s still cheaper to hire real-life human streamers.
That might change with Singapore-based startup IdoLive. The company recently launched its services, claiming to be Southeast Asia’s first digital AI celebrity marketing solution.
While some startups tackle this space by creating metahuman influencers, what makes IdoLive’s offering different is that it is working with actual human celebrities and creating AI versions of them.
At the company’s launch, Singaporean celebrities and influencers, including Gurmit Singh, Li Nanxing, and Vivian Lai, created realistic AI avatars of themselves through the platform. The avatars can be used for livestreams, product endorsements, and even news broadcasting.
“Using our AI avatars, we can communicate faster and more precisely,” said Li, who is an actor. “In addition, there is a limit to our physical strength and time, and we can only fit our availability within a schedule, but with AI, it can replace all of that.”
For all of its benefits, doing AI livestreams as a whole has its drawbacks too. For instance, each AI bot requires its own computer, due to the demands they place on graphics processors. This increases capital expenditure.
Some human livestreamers also think that AI bots cannot connect with audiences the way humans can. Actor Gurmit Singh, for one, said that audiences may think he is merely doing an “easy job” for easy money.
But eventually, especially as AI becomes more common in people’s daily lives, it may just be a matter of perspective. “They will also realize that this is a clever job,” said Singh.

With Thailand accounting for 58% of the total electric vehicles sold in Southeast Asia, as well as its status as a regional car manufacturing hub, VinFast is betting on the country’s potential.
The Vietnamese EV maker has signed agreements with 15 auto dealers in Thailand at the 2024 Bangkok International Motor Show. This follows the company’s expansion into Indonesia in February 2024, where it partnered with five local dealers.
VinFast now plans to open 22 showrooms in the Greater Bangkok area, which has an established charging infrastructure, among other things. The firm plans to expand its dealer network to other major Thai cities as well, including Chiang Mai, the second-largest city.
VinFast’s Thai expansion aligns with its goal to establish a presence in at least 50 countries by 2024. The company is actively growing its footprint in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, alongside established markets like the US, Canada, and Europe.
It is also planning to enter the Philippines.
Recently, the company announced the construction of a US$500 million EV factory in India, with an annual capacity of up to 150,000 units.
VinFast founder Pham Nhat Vuong is also investing US$404 million in a new venture that would focus on developing and deploying an EV charging station ecosystem that “prioritizes supporting VinFast vehicles.”
The company recently reported US$1.2 billion in revenue for the FY ended December 2023, 91% higher than the previous year. However, it also recorded a net loss of US$2.3 billion in 2023.

CFO Cho Weihao reveals this milestone in an interview with Tech in Asia.
“Similar to other companies, we had to make difficult decisions regarding reallocation of resources towards more profitable initiatives and products, and selective staff cost reductions,” he says.
This development comes after Una Brands, which is backed by Lazada Group founder and former CEO Maximilian Bittner, reported a significant uptick in net loss in 2022. Despite revenue going up by 9x, losses ballooned by 10x, according to Alternatives.pe, which tracks regulatory filings.

This was primarily due to increased distribution and marketing costs as well as administrative expenses, which already exceeded the company’s revenue for the year.
Una Brands has not disclosed its 2023 figures, but Cho says that with the reallocation of its resources since the beginning of last year, the company now has “an optimal organizational structure.”

Scale versus profitability
Una Brands works with ecommerce labels based in the Asia-Pacific region with annual revenues of US$300,000 to US$20 million. It uses tech to optimize the identification, product placement, and marketing efforts of these brands.
Launched in 2021 by Foodpanda co-founder Kiren Tanna, the firm rode the rise of the ecommerce roll-up sector on the back of companies like Thrasio.

While 2022 was all about growth and scaling up operations, Una Brands’ focus in 2023 was on profitability and cost efficiencies, Cho tells Tech in Asia.
The company laid off part of its workforce – less than 10% – in mid-2022, expecting to hit EBITDA profitability by the end of that year.
In its bid to scale up, it acquired several new brands and brought them to new markets in 2022.
This included the acquisitions of ergonomic chair brand ErgoTune and adjustable desk retailer EverDesk+, both Singapore-based companies. After the buyout, Una Brands took the two firms to the US and Australia, Cho says.
As of now, Una Brands has acquired around 20 ecommerce businesses.

Looking ahead, the company aims to continue balancing efficiency while continuing to make acquisitions.
“Apart from continued focus on profitable growth, we continue to opportunistically source for acquisition targets and strategic transactions,” Cho notes.
Effect of the TikTok Shop-Tokopedia merger
The labels that Una Brands works with sell across online platforms like TikTok Shop, Shopee, Lazada, and Amazon.
In Indonesia, particularly, TikTok Shop has become the ecommerce roll-up firm’s dominant channel, Cho says.
Since TikTok Shop made a comeback in the country following its ban, Una Brands has experienced a 2x surge in revenue from the channel, particularly in the beauty and wellness category, Cho shares.

According to the CFO, the company still sees “tremendous secular tailwinds” in Southeast Asia’s ecommerce scene, with the region’s population of over 600 million people.
This comes as global players are showing a “clear sign of distress,” with deals on hold as they look for new capital. Thrasio, for instance, filed for bankruptcy in February.

Una Brands’ latest funding was a US$30 million pre-series C round led by Northstar Group in March 2023, which boosted its total raise to over US$100 million.

Nevertheless, the ecommerce roll-up firm still has a lot to prove. After raising series A money in November 2021, the company said it wanted to have up to 80 brands in its portfolio by the end of 2022 – an achievement it was not able to fulfill.

India-based venture debt firm Alteria Capital has finalized the venture debt portion of its third fund at 15.5 billion rupees (US$185 million) – higher than its initial target of 10 billion rupees (US$120 million). This brings its total assets under management to US$521 million.
In addition to the venture debt portion, this latest fund also features a “shorter duration” scheme, which Alteria Capital said is the first of its kind in India. The scheme aims to cater to startups’ short-term financing needs.
On the whole, the fund aims to raise US$250 million to US$300 million across both schemes, with the shorter duration scheme expected to close by end-2024.
“The strategy to split our fund into two schemes with different propositions arises from the fact that startups need innovative solutions across different use cases, tenors, and price points,” co-founder and managing partner Vinod Murali stated.
So far, the fund has already deployed 50% of the total capital commitments in businesses like OneCard, Renee Cosmetics, and Rebel Foods. Alteria Capital will continue to invest in startups that have already raised VC funding, providing up to US$24 million per company.

Venture capital firm Golden Gate Ventures has appointed Angela Toy as its new COO. Toy, who was previously partner for portfolio growth, started at the firm as employee number two – she has been with Golden Gate Ventures since its inception in 2011.
Before becoming partner in 2021, Toy held various positions in the Singapore-based firm, including head of operations and finance and director of portfolio strategy and operations. She previously also completed a venture capital executive program at the University of California, Berkeley.
As COO, Toy will manage operations and support expansion initiatives – an increasingly crucial role with the fund’s recent ventures into Vietnam, Saudi Arabia, and New York.
“Our unique footprint connects the globe through Singapore, and the COO role is critical in elevating our firm as we gear up for our international play,” said Vinnie Lauria, founding partner at Golden Gate Ventures.
The VC firm has invested in over 90 companies such as Carro, Coda Payments, Stripe, and Carousell, with nine unicorns and two IPOs across its portfolio. After opening offices in Vietnam, Golden Gate Ventures was one of the 40 VCs that collectively pledged US$1.5 billion to invest in local startups.

Used-car marketplace Carro recorded a jump in revenue last year, as sales continued to rise and its investments in other areas like financing, insurance, and aftersales bloomed.
The Singapore-based company’s revenue grew 67% year on year to S$1.1 billion (US$818 million) in the financial year ended March 31, 2023, according to its audited financial statement.
While its core marketplace arm contributed 90% of its revenue, “the highest growth came from recurring and highly profitable ecosystem-led ancillaries (financing, mobility, insurance, aftersales),” Carro CFO Ernest Chew told Tech in Asia.
This has led to an improvement in gross profit margins, jumping from 5.3% in FY 2022 to 7.5% in FY 2023, he added. However, this figure would imply that Carro’s gross profit would be around US$61.1 million.
Meanwhile, losses after tax ballooned for FY 2023 to US$94 million from US$6.7 million in the prior year. This was due to a large contribution from unrealized strategic investment losses.
“In particular, one of our acquisitions has had its assets significantly revalued upward, but ironically had negatively impacted our P&amp;L (e.g., higher depreciation, reversal of fair value uplift) in the short term,” explained Chew.
In FY 2023, Carro made several moves to expand its offerings. One of these was a joint investment with Funding Societies into Indonesia’s Bank Index to bolster its fintech capabilities.
Carro also bought a 50% stake in Indonesian car rental firm Mitra Pinasthika Mustika Rent for a reported amount of US$54 million. In addition, it rolled out its services in Japan through a collaboration with SoftBank.
This is reflected in the company’s adjusted operating profit for the year, which improved 6% to negative US$28.9 million.
Additionally, employment benefits expense (before share-based compensation) almost doubled in FY 2023 to US$55 million, the biggest contributor to its expenses in the period.
“Our preferred way of looking is employee benefits as percent of gross profit,” said Chew. “Employee benefits (before share-based compensation) as a percent of gross profit has dropped significantly from 115% in FY 2022 to 89% in FY 2023.”
This would mean that the company generated more gross profit per employment cost for FY 2023.
Overall, Carro’s adjusted EBITDA for the year went into the green at almost US$3 million, a number it improved going into FY 2024. Chew said it expects to achieve EBITDA of US$33 million to US$37 million and positive adjusted operating profit for FY 2024.
In August last year, the company announced updates for this goal. It had hit US$11 million in EBITDA for the first quarter of FY 2024, its highest-ever quarterly profit.
“It’s not about selling more cars; it’s about capturing more value and recurring income streams,” said Aaron Tan, co-founder and CEO of Carro, at the time.
Recently, the company has been busy taking more strategic moves, such as expanding into Hong Kong and rebranding its subsidiary in Malaysia.
Tan also mentioned that Carro is “IPO-ready” and in a position to list “as soon as it becomes realistically possible.”

Hello reader,
The English pop band Frankie Goes to Hollywood famously sang about what happens when two tribes go to war and how the end result is never good. But what about when several ecommerce players are entangled in a price war?
It seems like we’re about to find out in Southeast Asia. Today’s featured story looks at how Alibaba’s new platform Choice is going head-to-head with Shopee, TikTok Shop, and Temu, with cheaper prices as the main weapon in its arsenal.
Consumers may benefit from discounts for now, but in the long run, this price war could have any number of unintended consequences – for the market and the combatants.
Today we look at:

How a regional ecommerce price war could shake out
ByteDance appears unlikely to sell TikTok despite US regulatory pressure
Other newsy highlights such as Binance facing a ban in the Philippines and Japanese investors eyeing up Southeast Asian firms via Helicap deal.


Premium summary
Battle lines drawn in SEA’s ecommerce price war

Chinese tech titan Alibaba has quietly been rolling out its new Choice platform across its Southeast Asian markets over the past year or so, aiming to emulate low-cost platforms Temu and Shein.
And just last month, little known Singapore-based ecommerce firm Qoo10 scooped up US discount retailer Wish for US$173 million.
These moves may signal the first salvoes in a price war in Southeast Asian ecommerce.


Deals on deals: Choice, accessed via the Lazada app, offers ultra-low prices, as well as shipping and bundle discounts for customers who order three or more items. The timing of its launch somewhat coincided with the entry of Temu into Southeast Asia in August 2023. Temu, which uses a model where the company takes care of everything from warehousing to customer service, allowing it to dictate pricing on behalf of Chinese manufacturers. This model is known as “fully managed” in the ecommerce world.

Downward pressure: While Temu has been spending more heavily on marketing in the US and the European Union, industry analysts believe it and other discount players can still put pressure on Shopee and Lazada to keep prices low. Joe Zhang, founding partner at Chinese ecommerce consulting firm Sailer Partners, notes that it’s difficult for marketplace platforms to compete on pricing since fully managed players can control the supply chain.

Holy grail: Profitability may prove elusive for companies competing solely on price, as substantial sales volume is required to make the economics work. For instance, Temu suffers a loss rate of 30% to 35% on orders in the US, according to a December 2023 report from Tech Buzz China. Shein claims to have reached profitability, but this has been largely driven by the US market. With consumer spending in Southeast Asia lower than in the West, that may prove a success difficult to replicate.

No deal

TikTok is facing a potential ban in the US unless the short-video app splits from its Chinese parent firm ByteDance.
However, Zhang Yiming – ByteDance’s founder and a major shareholder – is against a sale of TikTok, Caixin reported


State of play: The US House of Representatives passed a bill earlier this month that would give TikTok 180 days to branch away from ByteDance or leave the US market. However, the bill still has to be passed by the Senate to become law.

Time crunch: Sources told Caixin that ByteDance doubts a deal could be made in time and therefore is not looking for potential buyers. The company already views the US bill’s conditions as equivalent to a ban, the sources said.

Consequences: The US is TikTok’s largest market, with more than 116.5 million active users in the country aged 18 and above – its target advertising demographic. Being forced to abandon the US could hurt ByteDance’s value and increase investor pressure.

India’s grocery retail sector is estimated to be worth around US$600 billion, and multiple startups – as well as tech majors like WhatsApp and Tata-owned BigBasket – have all vied to conquer this space. More recently, quick commerce has increased in popularity, with beauty products gaining steam among consumers.
Much of that growth, however, remains centered in major urban areas. Consumers in Tier 2 towns and below still rely on traditional mom and pop stores known as kiranas. Startups like 1K Kirana – which aims to digitalize the shops’ operations  – and B2B ecommerce player Udaan also aren’t faring so well.
One startup aims to change this. SuperK, a franchise-based retail chain, is bringing its tech-enabled supermarkets into small towns across India, where customers are often going through an “organized retail experience” for the first time.
The startup has raised US$6 million in series A funding from investors like Blume Ventures and Silver Needle Ventures.
Co-founded in 2020 by Anil Thontepu and Neeraj Menta, SuperK uses tech for detailed purchase analysis, which helps stores understand customer buying patterns and customize offers. Its outlets are sized between 500 to 1,000 square feet and house about 2,500 stock-keeping units.
It is currently operational in over 80 towns in the south Indian state of Andhra Pradesh and has served over 500,000 families in the past four years. With the recent fund inflow, SuperK aims to improve its tech infrastructure and hire new staff, as well as onboard digitally native brands onto its platform.

Alibaba Group is dropping the Hong Kong IPO for Cainiao, its logistics subsidiary, South China Morning Post reported.
The news comes a few months after the Chinese tech giant shelved IPO plans for another subsidiary, grocery arm Freshippo.
Alibaba has proposed to purchase all of Cainiao’s outstanding shares and, in turn, increase synergies between logistics and its main ecommerce business. The group currently owns a 64% share in Cainiao and is allocating up to US$3.8 billion to buy the rest from minor shareholders.
Once the purchase is done, Alibaba aims to merge Cainiao’s operations with its own. Doing so will let Cainiao support Alibaba’s global logistics growth and better integrate with the group’s ecommerce businesses, which includes Taobao, Tmall, and the Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group.
Amid an intensifying battle with the likes of PDD, Alibaba began a major restructuring effort a year ago. The company was set to form six different business units and pursue an IPO for each, though after the change of plans for Freshippo and Cainiao, it’s unclear whether the strategy remains.
Meanwhile, the group has also made adjustments in its Southeast Asian business, which remains “very important” for the company. Pakistan-based subsidiary Daraz, for one, saw its original founder leave and replaced by Lazada Group head James Dong as acting CEO.
Both Lazada and Daraz also laid off staff just this year.
Founded in 2013, Cainiao has grown into a US$13.7 billion business. In the December quarter, the unit grew its revenue by 24% year on year, mainly due to its cross-border logistics services.

When Patrick Walujo assumed the role of CEO at GoTo in June 2023, he was largely known for co-founding private equity firm Northstar Group – which now manages US$2.6 billion in committed equity capital – and as an early backer of Gojek.
Indonesian analysts, in particular, were enthusiastic about the appointment, as Walujo has had an illustrious career in investments. Still, this marked his first time running a company of GoTo’s size, and his ascension came as Gojek’s co-founders had all departed.

Image credit: Tech in Asia

In August 2023, just two months after Walujo assumed leadership, GoTo sold two of its units for undisclosed sums. Its entertainment business GoPlay was bought by former GoTo executive Edy Sulistyo, while ticketing platform Loket – which operates the group’s GoTix offering – was sold to Loket CEO Bagus Utama.
But the firm’s boldest move came in December 2023, when GoTo sold 75% of Tokopedia to a rapidly growing foreign competitor: TikTok.
This deal underscores the new CEO’s ruthless execution, which appears to have borne an important fruit: For the first time ever, GoTo hit profitability on an adjusted basis in Q4 2023.
The task of transforming GoTo into a consistently profitable enterprise, however, extends far beyond a single quarter. For one, GoTo’s share price, at 68 rupiah (0.43 cents), is still in the doldrums. Secondly, Walujo is also reportedly acting as CEO temporarily, as he’s still serving as Northstar’s managing partner.
GoTo declined Tech in Asia’s request for an interview with Walujo. However, a person familiar with the matter says that the CEO is “committed for the long term.”
First Gojek investor
As far as power brokers go in Indonesian business, Walujo has the bona fides. After graduating from Jakarta’s Canisius College – one of Indonesia’s oldest and most prestigious high schools – he got his bachelor’s degree from New York’s Cornell University.

That was followed by a three-year stint at Goldman Sachs and a senior vice president role at Richard Li-owned investment firm Pacific Century Group from 2000 to 2003.
His wife, Ayu Patricia Rachmat, is the daughter of Indonesian business magnate Theodore Permadi Rachmat, who is also the founder of Triputra Group and the former CEO of the Astra International conglomerate. In 2023, Forbes ranked the older Rachmat – whose net worth is about US$3.6 billion – among Indonesia’s 20 richest people.
In March 2003, Walujo co-founded Northstar Group. Over a decade later in 2014, the firm became Gojek’s first institutional investor through its affiliate VC firm, NSI Ventures (now Openspace Ventures), though the amount was undisclosed.

At that time, Gojek’s ride-hailing service model was still based on call centers. As a close friend to Gojek co-founder Nadiem Makarim, Walujo encouraged the founder to turn the call center business into an app, which Gojek eventually launched in 2015.
You could say this move echoes Sean Parker’s suggestion to Mark Zuckerberg to drop “the” from Facebook’s name. It was also par for the course for Walujo to discern that Makarim was onto something game-changing.
While GoTo hasn’t achieved the same status as global giants yet, it was still one of Northstar’s most successful investments. GoTo was estimated to be worth US$18 billion in 2021 when Gojek merged with another homegrown champion, Tokopedia.
At the time of GoTo’s IPO, Openspace’s shares in the company were valued at nearly US$200 million, according to Tech in Asia’s previous calculations.
Besides Gojek, Northstar has invested in over 50 companies across various sectors.

One important Northstar deal, which later became crucial to Gojek, was the private equity firm’s investment in local bank BTPN. After Northstar backed BTPN in 2008, veteran banker Jerry Ng was appointed as the bank’s CEO.
Ng left in 2019, after which he and Walujo acquired a small but listed Indonesian bank called Bank Artos. Ng held 37.65%, while Walujo had 13.35% ownership. A year later, Gojek bought nearly a quarter stake in the bank, which had been rebranded to Bank Jago.
Now, Bank Jago serves as GoTo’s digital banking arm. As of December 30, 2023, however, Ng and Walujo are still its controlling shareholders.
“This is a war, and we have to win this”
In March 2023, GoTo slashed 600 jobs, which followed its first round of layoffs in 2022. Three months later, Walujo officially succeeded Andre Soelistyo as CEO. “We have always talked about professionalizing the company so that it can move beyond its founders,” Soelistyo said in an email to staff at the time.
Leading GoTo in a declining tech market certainly would be a challenge. In Q2 2023, when Walujo took over, GoTo had recorded net losses of US$216 million, with an adjusted EBITDA of negative US$79 million.
A former employee tells Tech in Asia that Walujo implemented a mandatory full-time work-in-office policy in August 2023, which did not go well with some employees at the time.
“He is very focused,” says the ex-employee when asked about Walujo’s leadership. The person recalls the CEO saying “this is a war, and we have to win this” at a company town hall as he stressed the importance of achieving profitability.
In the latest earnings call, Walujo said that GoTo started 2023 with a “significant problem,” as it burned 16 trillion rupiah or US$1 billion in 2022. “We had only a year and a half of runway left according to some market estimates,” he said.
The competitive landscape wasn’t limited to Grab – Shopee, Lazada, and TikTok Shop were also exerting pressure, stretching GoTo’s resources even further.
The company’s overseas business wasn’t progressing either – GoTo sold its Thailand unit to AirAsia in 2021. As of June 27, 2023 – three days before Walujo’s appointment – the firm’s stock price plummeted 67% compared to its IPO levels.

Selling Tokopedia, in particular, was no small feat. Both Gojek and Tokopedia are regarded as “national champions” of Indonesia, inspiring countless entrepreneurs and startup founders in the country. But Tokopedia had lost the battle for dominance in Indonesia to Shopee, and TikTok Shop’s arrival made things more intense.
Walujo’s investor background instills financial discipline in the company and sets aside sentimental feelings that founders may have when making major decisions, says Joel Shen, partner at global law firm Withers.
“Patrick is there to do a very specific job of making this company profitable,” notes Shen, who specializes in the Indonesian market. “In terms of turning the company profitable, the investor is more objective, more clear, and more disciplined.”
TikTok Shop’s ban in September 2023 presented an opportunity. The platform was believed to be losing US$20 million in gross merchandise volume a day in Indonesia, its biggest market in the region.

But Tokopedia wasn’t the sole potential M&amp;A target for TikTok, as domestic rivals Blibli and Bukalapak were reportedly in talks as well.

The deal with Tokopedia facilitated TikTok Shop’s return to business just two months after it was banned. In return, TikTok committed to invest over US$1.5 billion in Tokopedia, with no additional dilution to GoTo. Consequently, GoTo is expected to receive a steady stream of cash flow in the form of ecommerce service fees from Tokopedia.
The Tokopedia-TikTok deal showcases Walujo’s reputation as the dealmaker, says Angus Mackintosh, founder at CrossASEAN Research and an insight provider at SmartKarma. “These skills come from his private equity background, investing in businesses, improving returns, restructuring.”
“He’s so good at politicking his way into a deal,” says a former C-suite executive of a Walujo-backed startup. Sometimes that might rub certain people the wrong way, but “for me, in the confines of business, it’s completely normal.” He pointed out that Northstar’s investment in Jagat, a metaverse startup championed by outgoing Indonesian president Joko Widodo, was one of many “strategic moves.”

Maintaining strong relationships with the government is even more pivotal in Indonesia. Walujo exemplified this when he met with the president-elect and current defense minister Prabowo Subianto in July 2023, along with Hong Kong billionaire Richard Li. But it remained unclear whether that meeting involved discussions related to GoTo.

Will he stay on?
Walujo hasn’t given up his responsibilities at Northstar.
Melvin Hade, managing director of the private equity firm, confirms that all investment activities still require Walujo’s approval and that the Northstar team still updates the co-founder about portfolio companies.
Walujo even occasionally spends time at the Northstar office, although most of his time is now for GoTo, another source close to the matter tells Tech in Asia.
Catching up with founders has become less frequent due to his increased commitment to GoTo, the person adds.
The big question remains: Will he stay at GoTo even after the company’s financial situation improves further, or will he revert to his role as an investor?
Following its inaugural profitability milestone in Q4 2023, GoTo has set its sights on breaking even at the adjusted EBITDA level for the entirety of 2024.

In its latest earnings call, Walujo stated that the company is willing to make “all the appropriate investments” this year to boost user growth even more, aiming for sustainable profitability while discontinuing non-scalable initiatives.
Another milestone for GoTo could also be an international IPO, even though the CEO announced that it had shelved the plan indefinitely.
“In the longer term, GoTo cannot close itself to this opportunity [to list overseas] forever,” says Withers’ Shen. “In the short term, there is a lot of homework that needs to be done.”
Mackintosh believes that Walujo excels in “restructuring,” but it takes more than that to maintain sustainable earnings and run the company for many years to come.
A person familiar with the matter tells Tech in Asia that Walujo’s focus is on GoTo and that, like many business leaders, he is “perfectly able to manage his time to cover multiple responsibilities, including his important role at Northstar.”
Ultimately, the question remains unanswered – at least until Walujo himself publicly states his commitment.","Patrick Walujo’s strategic prowess sealed a game-changing deal with TikTok, yet questions linger about his dedication to GoTo’s future.",Jofie Yordan,"Editing by Thu Huong Le, Putra Muskita, and Jaclyn Tiu",open,0,"",https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1711535983_fi-goto-ceo-delivers-first-profit-but-will-he-stay.png,false,"",false,true,true,true,false,8,,1736,"GoTo CEO delivers first quarterly profit, but will he stay on?","Patrick Walujo’s strategic prowess sealed a game-changing deal with TikTok, yet questions linger about his dedication to GoTo’s future.",,,"","",""

* Why unprofitable insurtech firm Qoala still managed to secure a large series C investment* What the strong inflows of credit into Asia mean for borrowers in the region* How the humble QR code is shaking Vietnam’s payments scene

Welcome to The Top Up! Delivered every fortnight via email and through the Tech in Asia website, this free newsletter breaks down the biggest stories and trends in fintech. Get it in your email inbox by registering here.
Hello there,
I once interviewed the founder of an insurtech firm who said that he wanted to bring “insurance and love closer together.”
I didn’t love insurance then, and I still don’t love it now.
Maybe that’s a sign of how fortunate I’ve been. After all, the fact that I haven’t had to claim a payout from an insurance policy means that nothing bad has happened to me so far.
Whatever the case, the insurtech industry continues to see tremendous growth. In this week’s featured story, my colleague Budi notes that Indonesia’s Qoala has generated US$280 million in gross written premiums since 2020, with 52% of that recorded in 2023.
Investors appear to like what they see, even though Qoala has yet to turn a profit. The company has just raised US$47 million in a series C round led by PayPal Ventures and MassMutual Ventures, bringing the total capital raised to nearly US$140 million.
Budi’s article explores why, even amid today’s high interest rates, investors are willing to look beyond the bottom line to bet on Qoala.
On the topic of high interest rates, I take a closer look at how this hasn’t stopped a wave of credit from coming into Asia, with nearly half a billion dollars worth of funding for lending to MSMEs and startups being announced over the past week.

THE HOT TAKE
Lending booms in Asia despite high interest rates

Here’s what happened:

The past week has seen lots of activity in the lending space, with nearly half a billion in funds committed to lending to SMEs and startups in the region.
The investors include traditional banks like DBS and HSBC, along with tech players such as Ant Group and Crowd Credit.

Major tech platforms like Sea Group, Grab, and GoTo Group have also talked up their lending capabilities.

Here’s our take:
Central bankers aim to lower inflation by raising interest rates. The theory is that higher rates lead to lower borrowing, which constrains economic activity, and hopefully brings down excessive price increases.
However, despite the fact that interest rates in many countries are at generationally high levels, lending activity does not seem to be slowing, at least in the tech sector.
DBS’ Indian arm has pledged to lend US$250 million to the country’s startups, while HSBC Singapore has committed US$100 million to Indonesian lending platform Akulaku.
Meanwhile, Ant Group has topped up the capital of its Singapore-based digital bank Anext – which focuses on regional and local MSMEs – by US$148 million.
The most recent funding news involves Japanese lending platform Crowd Credit, which has partnered with Singapore fintech firm Helicap to channel US$50 million to Southeast Asian firms.
This increased lending activity speaks to the extent to which individuals and businesses in the region lack access to capital. Clearly, there’s also good money to be made because these lenders aren’t giving out funds out of charity.
For example, a tool available on Anext’s website shows that if a business were to borrow S$100,000 (US$74,352), with a repayment period of 6 months, the estimated total repayment would be S$105,000 (US$78,070). This works out to an interest rate of 5% for the period, or around 10% annualized.
That’s far higher than the 2.74% interest the holder of a Singapore government bond can expect over a one-year period.
Of course, the Singapore government is one of the safest borrowers in the world, whereas lending to MSMEs in the region entails taking on much larger risks.
However, it seems that many are relishing the opportunity.
Southeast Asia’s tech platforms are in on the action too. Indonesia’s GoTo Group saw its consumer lending book grow by 32% quarter on quarter to US$123 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 – its most recent quarter.
As for arch-rival Grab, total outstanding loans rose by 18.5% to US$326 million in Q4 2023 compared to the previous quarter.
Crucially, credit quality seems to be holding up. GoTo’s non-performing loans (NPL) amounted to 1.3% of its total consumer loan book in December, while Grab said its NPL ratios were at a “low single digit.”
So far, so good.
However, the question is whether these numbers are sustainable when credit continues to flow into the system, especially when the economic outlook for 2024 is mixed.
2024 is expected to be a “transitional year” for Asian economies, paving the way for a more sustained recovery in 2025.
Meanwhile, Southeast Asia may suffer from weak external demand. Also, borrowing money to expand a business is very different from doing so to fund consumption.
A recent survey commissioned by Shopee on the habits of Gen Z consumers in six Southeast Asian countries reflects this concern. It found that over 30% of younger users decided not to buy 70% of goods in their shopping cart on the ecommerce platform. A majority of these users (52%) said the main reason was becaue the items were above their budget.
Shopee intends to expand Shopee PayLater – its buy now, pay later service – to all users. But will encouraging users to spend more, on items they would not otherwise be able to afford, really benefit them?
Of course, consumers should be free to decide for themselves how to best manage their finances. But the huge sums of credit finding its way into the region may not be an unalloyed good.

India’s babycare industry has seen rapid growth, with local player FirstCry set for a US$219 million IPO sometime this year. Players in Southeast Asia, however, face a fragmented region with a slowing birth rate.
Still, some companies in the region appear to be thriving. Singapore-based parent tech firm The Parentinc, which owns media platform TheAsianparent, is betting big on offline retail with its acquisition of Motherswork. Direct-to-consumer baby products company KeaBabies – headquartered in Singapore but focused on the US market – also hit US$58 million in revenue last year.
Now, Applecrumby, a 12-year-old babycare brand and ecommerce platform based in Malaysia, has secured a US$4.2 million growth investment from 500 Global to help it expand globally.
The company currently has a presence in 11 countries, offering its affordable line of babycare products to markets like China, Vietnam, Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines.
Apart from offline channels, it also sells its products through online platforms like Shopee, Lazada, and TikTok Shop.
With the new capital, Applecrumby aims to expand that number to 20 by the end of the year. In its home country, the startup aims to have its products available in close to 2,000 retail locations within the same timeframe.
This may help Applecrumby fight for market share in Southeast Asia’s competitive babycare landscape. Aside from The Parentinc and KeaBabies, the region is also home to players like Edamama in the Philippines and Concung in Vietnam.
Applecrumby was founded in 2012 by husband and wife team Sean and Jesmine Tan. They launched the firm after the birth of their daughter, as they were frustrated with the lack of safe and natural baby products available in the market.
The company develops products like PureBasics diapers, which Applecrumby says is the world’s first chlorine-free mass-market diaper product.
In addition to global expansion, Applecrumby said it will use part of the new funds to create new products in the PureBasics line.

Global trading and investment firm Mitsui &amp; Co. has poured an undisclosed amount of capital into LinkAja, just a few months after the Indonesian digital payment system provider hit EBITDA profitability.
With this deal, which marks the first international investment into LinkAja, the company plans to expand its ecosystem and business – which would involve partnerships with its state-owned enterprise (SOE) shareholders.
Initially a service under Indonesian telco Telkomsel, LinkAja was then spun out in 2019 as a joint venture between 10 SOEs. It offers digital wallet services and payment services, as well as bulk payment services for enterprise clients – which can be used for payroll disbursement, among others.
Aside from Telkomsel, which holds a majority stake, its investors include energy giant Pertamina and state-owned banks BNI, BRI and Bank Mandiri.
Led by CEO Yogi Rizkian Bahar, LinkAja revamped its business approach and cut costs, including an 80% reduction in marketing expenses. This helped lead the firm to positive EBITDA in late 2023.
The company also sharpened its focus on the SOE ecosystem – a strategy it aims to continue in 2024, LinkAja said in a statement. It also targets a positive net income by this year, the company previously said.
For Mitsui, the investment would support its digital finance business development – especially in areas like ICT and retail.
“As society continues to digitalize, we are also growing our focus on the value of the digital economy, including digital finance in Indonesia,” said Shinichi Kikuchihara, Mitsui Indonesia’s president director.

When Oliver Lo worked as vice president of marketing for Surge, Peak XV’s scale-up program, he saw many startups struggling without the necessary marketing guidance.
“From value proposition and brand positioning to finding repeatable growth motions without the need for unsustainable paid ad budgets, these aren’t simple challenges for most startups,” Lo said. “Many struggle without the right marketing leadership.”
That led him to co-found Fractional, which bills itself as a collective of chief marketing officers (CMOs), with fellow Southeast Asia-based marketing leaders Sophie Jokelson and Rana Saha.
Based in Singapore, the company curates Southeast Asia’s top marketing leaders and matches them with startups, bringing Silicon Valley’s “fractional hiring” trend to Southeast Asia. The term refers to startups hiring highly experienced executives, like CMOs or CFOs, on a short-term or part-time basis.
The three founding partners bring roughly 50 years of combined experience working for companies like Grab, Uber, App Annie, and Standard Chartered.
As Fractional pointed out, Southeast Asia’s tech ecosystem is relatively young, with smaller funding rounds compared to mature markets like the US. For early-stage startups, this means a lack of CMOs who have deep operator experience while also being affordable, thus leading them to hire full-time CMOs relatively late in the game.
Saha added that marketers often have to choose between challenging work in growth companies and steady, well-paying jobs. With Fractional, experienced marketers can get an alternative, where they work on interesting problems without sacrificing pay.
The company is already working with business founders and VC firms. Jokelson said that the team is seeing an increased interest in Fractional’s model amid the economic downturn, as startup fundraising becomes increasingly scarce.
“And as we turn the corner, I strongly believe that companies will find more sustainable ways to grow into the next cycle,” she added.

Hong Kong’s startup scene is considered the second-best in the world and the first in Asia, according to the 2023 Global Startup Ecosystem Index. However, the city is not unaffected by the recent reduction in global funding.
To tackle this, the government has introduced a variety of supportive measures such as tax cuts.
Now, Hang Seng Bank, one of the largest banks in Hong Kong, has launched a HK$33 billion (US$4.2 billion) fund to aid the city’s smaller businesses, including startups.
The SME Power Up Fund offers various loan options including trade finance and revolving loans. It also has ESG offerings such as green loans and social loans.
According to the bank, it launched the fund to help companies through their post-pandemic woes such as inadequate cash flow, a loss in business momentum, and rising operational expenses. It also aims to support startups that are looking to expand across the Greater Bay Area.
The fund “is our tangible commitment to SMEs, structured to complement the government’s supportive measures highlighted in the recent budget,” said Regina Lee, head of commercial banking at Hang Seng Bank.
The bank said that it currently serves nearly 25% of SMEs in Hong Kong. It added that around 60% of its new customers are startups.

There was a time when this team setup seemed unlikely. Today, however, having a globally distributed workforce – in which employees aren’t bound to physical offices – offers many benefits to employers.



Click on the arrows to learn more about the rise of globally distributed teams.
“Globalization has spurred companies to seek talent beyond their immediate geographical boundaries,” says Jonathan Goldsmith, vice president and general manager of Global Payroll at Remote. The company aims to eliminate barriers to international hiring and enable businesses and remote talent to collaborate regardless of their location. Remote’s Global Payroll capabilities can be accessed alongside its other products and services.
“Having a flexible work model has also become a key deciding factor for many workers, especially for the newer generation,” he adds. “In our report – which we wrote based on a survey involving over 1,000 decision makers and employees – 42% of Gen Z respondents would leave their job for a remote work opportunity.”
Easier said than done
Despite the benefits, managing distributed teams is easier said than done. Companies have to grapple with a plethora of challenges – and the finance side of the equation, in particular, has proven to be a challenging hurdle – especially for companies that have just transitioned to the distributed workforce model.
This is “due to its complexity and resource-intensive nature,” says Goldsmith. “Employers often need extensive training and time investment to understand and effectively implement new processes related to finance.”
To better understand the challenges that come with distributed workforces, here are three of the biggest finance-related hurdles companies face and how to tackle them.
1. Tackling compensation
Addressing fair compensation in distributed workforces poses a multifaceted challenge.
With distributed teams spanning multiple jurisdictions, companies must navigate a maze of legal requirements and employment regulations.
The first thing to do is to determine if remote workers are classified as employees or contractors – and this can be confusing.
For instance, people in France can work under a permanent contract or a fixed-term contract. They can also be recruited for temporary work through agencies. In the UK, rights vary between employees, workers, and self-employed individuals.

“The distinctions – which can be complex and difficult to understand – lie in the specific employment rights, benefits, and regulatory frameworks associated with each status in their respective countries,” explains Goldsmith.
Aside from legal compliance regarding employment status, disparities in living costs, taxes, and mandatory government contributions factor prominently in the pay equation. Compensation packages need to reflect not only market rates and industry standards, but also the economic realities of each location a company hires in.
“Issues related to compensation and benefits are really frustrating for employees,” he shares.
Balancing these considerations while maintaining equity and fairness poses a significant challenge, and having the right talent with the necessary knowledge and expertise is therefore crucial to manage international payroll efficiently.
“If there is a lack in any of these areas, outsourcing global payroll may prove to be the wisest choice,” says Goldsmith.
2. Managing cultural nuances
Navigating cultural differences in distributed workforces is no easy task. It also influences how and what a company pays its employees.
“Some countries mandate a thirteenth-month pay and the general assumption is that it’s disbursed at the end of the year, but this varies across different countries,” notes Goldsmith.
Workers in Muslim-majority Indonesia, for example, typically receive a yearly bonus known as THR (Tunjangan Hari Raya or Hari Raya Allowance), which is generally considered a thirteenth-month salary and is paid at least a week before Eid al-Fitr starts. For non-Muslim employees, the bonus can be paid before their respective major religious holidays, such as Christmas.

Reconciling varying public holidays and paid time-off regulations across different countries can also be tedious. With team members dispersed across time zones and jurisdictions, coordinating schedules and ensuring equitable treatment can be a logistical nightmare.
Consider parental leave: Different countries, even if they’re under a regional organization like the European Union (EU), will have unique regulations on the leave mothers and fathers will receive.
“Sometimes, there’s even a difference between pregnancy and maternity leave, as is the case in Estonia,” shares Goldsmith. “So if you’re managing distributed teams, you need to be aware of all these intricacies or your planning may fall by the wayside.”
3. Safeguarding data
Data protection and management can be particularly difficult for distributed workforces due to the increasingly stringent enforcement of global data protection laws around the world, which can vary significantly across different jurisdictions.
“Companies in the EU are subject to very specific requirements under the General Data Protection Regulation, but if you look at the US, it’s vastly different,” says Goldsmith. “There’s no principal federal data protection regulator, but several federal regulatory agencies enforce data protection laws for specific actors or sectors, such as financial institutions and the healthcare industry.”

On top of that, the distributed nature of remote work amplifies the challenge of data security. With employees spread across geographical locations and accessing sensitive information from various devices and networks, the risk of data breaches increases significantly.
Finance teams are particularly vulnerable as they typically have access to a wealth of sensitive information on a company’s employees and financial status. If the firm turns to fintech services to streamline operations, it needs to implement robust security protocols to protect data at every touchpoint.
This poses a logistical challenge as companies must not only establish policies and procedures for data protection, but also educate employees about cybersecurity best practices.

“Managing these challenges demands significant resources, expertise, and proactive measures to mitigate risks and ensure smooth operations for distributed teams,” adds Goldsmith.
Businesses that don’t have the resources to manage this on their own can turn to tools like Remote’s Global Payroll. Accessible via Remote’s platform, it’s integrated with the company’s additional capabilities for hiring, managing, and paying a global workforce. Employers can enjoy a simple user experience while leveraging the benefits of having all employee data kept securely in one place.
“Companies with distributed teams often use a patchwork of local payroll partners, or expensive multicountry payroll providers that don’t offer a comprehensive solution,” says Goldsmith. “We want to give companies the confidence of payroll accuracy, speed, compliance, and a great employee experience, wherever their teams are based.”
To a distributed future
From Goldsmith’s perspective, distributed workforces are going to become increasingly commonplace on the road ahead.
“The demand for greater and more diverse talents will rise, pushing companies to tap into the global talent pool,” he shares.
He emphasizes that as businesses go increasingly global and start hiring from all around the world, the finance piece of the equation is a crucial one.
“It is something that companies must get right from the start,” Goldsmith says. “Issues related to compensation and benefits can hurt morale, loyalty to the company, and retention rates, all of which impact businesses negatively in the long run.”

Remote’s mission is to create opportunity everywhere, empowering employers to find and hire the best talent, and enabling individuals to build financial and personal freedom.

Kamereo, a B2B food-sourcing platform, has raised US$2.1 million as it aims to secure market leadership in its home country of Vietnam.
The fresh funds were raised in a pre-series B round, led by Japan-based Reazon Holdings and Thoru Yamamoto, who is the CEO of Tokyo-listed B2B firm Foodison. China-based VC firm Quest Ventures also participated in the funding round.
Since its inception in July 2019, Kamereo has aimed for profitability. It achieved the feat in early 2023, its CEO and founder Taku Tanaka told Tech in Asia.
“This improvement stems from various kaizens, or continuous improvements in Japanese, undertaken daily by our team,” he added. These include doubling down on direct purchases from producers and enhancing the firm’s operational capacity.
The startup primarily offers an online marketplace for farmers and food and beverage businesses to trade and source fresh supplies.
In 2021, when the company closed its series A round, Tanaka told Tech in Asia that Kamereo is an alternative for small and medium-sized F&amp;B businesses in Vietnam, which usually source their ingredients from wet markets.
Now, Tanaka said the company plans to expand its reach within Vietnam. “Currently, we’re poised for expansion into Hanoi, complementing our existing service coverage in Ho Chi Minh City and Binh Duong City.”
Kamereo is also looking to step into Cambodia, given its proximity to Ho Chi Minh City.
To aid in its scaling efforts, Kamereo has expanded its consumer retail business through its in-house brand. The company has been selling “ready-to-eat” salads through supermarkets and convenience stores since 2023. Kamereo will use part of the new funds to develop this business.
“Unlike traditional players, we’re committed to long-term investment in building a comprehensive supply chain system, setting us apart in the market,” Tanaka said. “With our strong team and operational foundation, we’re poised to emerge as the leading food supply chain company in Vietnam.”

It’s become a cliche to say that VC firms are now “focused on businesses that can turn a profit.”
Yet Qoala, an Indonesia-based insurtech firm, has just raised a US$47 million series C round despite the fact that it’s still in the red.
The company reported a net loss of US$22.3 million in 2022, according to Alternatives.pe, which tracks regulatory filings. While it did not disclose details of its 2023 financials, Qoala confirms that it has yet to turn a profit.
The series C injection, led by PayPal Ventures and MassMutual Ventures, is smaller than the US$65 million that Qoala secured in 2022. The series B round was led by France-based investor Eurazeo, who also joined the latest fundraise.

The latest investment brings the insurtech firm’s total capital raised to nearly US$140 million.
In an exclusive interview with Tech in Asia, Qoala says that the latest funding round reflects a confidence that the company will break even in the future due to its “strong unit economics and positive contribution margins.”

Indeed, even in today’s environment, profitability is not always a rigid requirement for attracting investor funding, says Theresa Blissing, founder of the Asia InsurTech Podcast.
Given the country’s relatively low insurance penetration rate, “investors evaluating insurtech companies in Indonesia may place particular emphasis on the potential for market expansion,” she explains.
Qoala says it will use the new funds to expand its market reach in Southeast Asia, grow new distribution channels and product lines, and deploy AI into its operations.
Over five years of runway
The company’s 2022 loss was due to higher sales and marketing expenses as well as larger general and administrative expenses. The former was tied to higher transactions, while the latter included operating expenses and headcount costs, the company says.

These expenses were increasing at a higher rate than the gain in revenue between 2021 and 2022. Sales and marketing expenses rose from 56% to 105% of revenue, while the corresponding figures for general and administrative expenses increased from 203% to 243%.
Despite this, Qoala says that it has “cracked the right unit economics,” adding that it will focus on growth in 2024.
It’s unclear how the company’s bottom line fared last year, but Qoala says that in December 2023, it achieved its highest-ever contribution margin and experienced the lowest cash burn in the preceding two years.
In July 2023, the firm laid off 80 employees across Indonesia and Malaysia, which would have helped reduce its staff costs.
Nevertheless, the startup says it’s “well-capitalized” and has no further retrenchment plans. In fact, it is hiring more people to ramp up its production.
This is supported by a cash runway of more than five years, Qoala reveals.
GWP fight
Launched in December 2018, Qoala operates on two main business models: embedded partnerships and an insurance agency, with the former already profitable, according to the company.
Through embedded partnerships, the startup provides microinsurance products that are sold on the platforms of its corporate partners, which include the likes of Traveloka, RedBus, Dana, JD.id, Shopee, Kredivo, and Investree. More recently, Qoala linked up with fintech lender Julo to offer gadget insurance.
“This business line was launched in 2018 and has therefore had sufficient time to scale up,” Qoala tells Tech in Asia.

Meanwhile, through its agency business, Qoala distributes retail insurance products with the help of agent partners, the number of which is comparable to its competitors at around 60,000.
The company tells Tech in Asia that its agency line’s contribution margin is currently positive in all markets, but it still needs to cover the fixed costs through production scale.
Since 2020, Qoala has facilitated over 215 million policies and generated US$280 million in gross written premiums (GWP) for its overall business. Around 52% of the GWP figure was recorded last year.
In comparison, local competitor Fuse, backed by East Ventures and Emtek Group, generated total GWP of over US$355 million between 2020 and 2022, according to Tech in Asia’s calculations based on news sources for those three years. Fuse sold 150 million policies in 2022 alone.
Meanwhile, PasarPolis – which touts itself as the first full-stack insurtech firm in Indonesia – is arguably a much bigger player. According to its website, it sold over 1 billion policies between 2019 and 2021, though its GWP is undisclosed.

Profitability is not everything
Qoala says its main goal is to become profitable company-wide “in the next couple of years.”
It intends to do so by monetizing its tech capabilities and replicating its already-profitable segments in other countries, among other efforts.
The company’s approach echoes Blissing’s argument that apart from profitability, investors often consider factors like scalability, consumer engagement, and potential for market disruption.
According to the 2022 ASEAN Insurance Surveillance Report, as quoted by Indonesia’s financial services authority, the country’s insurance penetration rate
is 2.7%, lower than that of neighboring countries like Singapore (12.5%), Malaysia (3.8%), and Thailand (4.6%).
“This suggests that insurtech companies positioned to capitalize on Indonesia’s growth opportunities could be well-positioned to attract funding, even in the absence of immediate profitability,” Blissing says.

Moreover, the time it takes for an insurtech firm to become profitable varies based on the type of business it runs, she adds.
For example, companies focused on distribution or providing software solutions to streamline insurance processes might reach profitability quickly by showing immediate cost savings or efficiency gains for insurers.
On the other hand, licensed insurance carriers operating as insurtech startups might take longer to become profitable as they need to invest in building underwriting capabilities, establishing risk management practices, and meeting regulatory requirements.
Blissing adds that market characteristics also play a crucial role in an insurtech firm’s path to profitability, especially in Indonesia with its low financial literacy.
“Companies such as Qoala, operating in such markets, may need to invest resources in long-term educational initiatives to increase understanding and trust in insurance products, which can delay the path to profitability but lay a foundation for sustainable growth in the future,” she argues.","Despite generating US$280 million in gross written premiums since 2020, the Indonesia-based startup has yet to turn a profit.",Gabriel Budi Sutrisno,Editing by Simon Huang and Lorenzo Kyle Subido,open,0,"",https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1711511385_Tommy-Martin-deputy-CEO-and-co-founder-of-Qoala-Harshet-Lunani-CEO-and-founder-of-Qoala.png,false,"",false,true,true,true,false,5,,1052,Why are VCs betting on Qoala despite it being in the red?,"Despite generating US$280 million in gross written premiums since 2020, the Indonesia-based startup has yet to turn a profit.",,,"","",""

True Global Ventures (TGV), a Singapore-based VC firm, has promoted Beatrice Lion to CEO.
Lion has been with the company since 2017. During her tenure, Lion contributed to the VC firm’s efforts in raising US$113 million for TGV’s 4 Plus Base Fund in 2021 and US$146 million for the Opportunity Fund in 2022.
Lion’s role at TGV covers diverse areas of fund management, including formulating exit strategies, fundraising, sourcing deals, and enhancing value.
Alongside Lion’s promotion, Frank Desvignes and Kelly Choo were appointed as the firm’s executive directors.
Dušan Stojanović has also passed on his executive roles in Innovator Founders Capital, to Julian Marland, allowing Stojanović to concentrate on the TGV 4 Plus fund and the Opportunity Fund.
Founded in 2010, TGV prefers to invest in companies at the seed, early, growth, and later stages. In 2018, the company secured a venture capital fund manager license in Singapore to bolster its operations.
Last year, after investing mainly in blockchain equity since 2016, TGV shifted its focus back to AI as interest in space skyrocketed due to advancements from companies like OpenAI.
Some of its past investments in AI include Aptiv.io, Bluerider Software, Quantumrock, and Singularity Studio.

ByteDance is cutting jobs in its corporate collaboration unit Feishu – which also houses Lark, the platform’s international version – with around 1,000 workers affected. The unit’s leader Xie Xin announced the restructuring measure in a letter, South China Morning Post reported, citing a source in the know of the matter.
Those affected will get compensation or a chance to switch to other roles in the company.
However, the TikTok parent firm might lay off up to 20% of Feishu’s employees in total, or over 5,000 people, mostly in mainland China.
This follows a trend of job cuts in China’s tech sector due to economic and regulatory concerns. Previously, ByteDance has reduced staffing in other sectors, such as in education services due to regulatory changes that affected tutoring services.
Meanwhile, TikTok had done well in the US last year; recently, it reported US$16 billion in 2023 revenue from the US market amid regulatory challenges.
However, it is now facing a potential ban in the country if it does not branch out from ByteDance. The company has decided not to sell TikTok’s US business as a deal isn’t likely to be made within the six-month deadline the US government set for ByteDance.
Meanwhile, Feishu will continue focusing on AI. Last year, the unit added an AI assistant to the Feishu app. This feature can condense meetings, filter messages, and read various files.
As AI continues to be a priority for ByteDance, the company has been cutting jobs across several businesses, such as its gaming division and Pico, its virtual reality unit.
Recently, ByteDance posted over 100 job openings related to generative AI, with most roles based in Singapore and the US.

Canva, the Australia-based graphic design platform, has acquired Affinity, which provides design services catered more to professionals.
The deal was valued at “several hundred million pounds,” according to a Bloomberg report citing Canva COO and co-founder Cliff Obrecht.
Before the acquisition, Canva saw growth among non-professionally trained users who were drawn to the platform’s ease of use.
Integrating Affinity’s software allows Canva to expand its reach to all levels of designers and helps it stand toe to toe with companies like Adobe.
According to data from Statista, Adobe Photoshop leads the graphics software market so far this year with a roughly 42% share. Meanwhile, InDesign – Adobe’s professional design software product – also has double the market share of Canva.
Affinity’s suite has over 3 million users worldwide. Meanwhile, Canva, which is used by over 175 million people, expects the acquisition to enhance its design tool offerings and penetrate the professional design market.
“The Affinity team comes with an incredible caliber of talent and technology and we’re delighted to welcome them to Canva as we enter our next phase together,” he added in a statement.
Over the years, Canva has made moves to branch out of its initial focus on light, but functional editing. In 2022, the firm acquired Flourish, an online tool for designing charts, for an undisclosed sum.
Before that, it had acquired other European companies like Smartmockups and Kaleido in 2021 as well as Pexels and Pixabay in 2019.
Earlier this year, Canva was said to be close to finalizing a share sale by investors, which would raise over US$1.5 billion in proceeds.

Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, is reportedly planning to visit Indonesia around April 20.
The purpose of his visit? It’s said to be related to the company’s investment plans in Indonesia, including the possibility that it will build a factory in the country, said Budi Arie Setiadi, the Minister of Communication and Information.
“All possibilities are there, we will see how the approach will be later,” Setiadi said, as reported by local media outlet Bisnis.
These plans are, of course, still uncertain and will be negotiated further when Cook arrives in Indonesia, the minister added.
In 2017, Apple invested US$44 million in Indonesia. At that time, the investment was made through the construction of the Apple Academy located in BSD City in the Banten province.
As of February 2024, iOS market share in Indonesia reached 10%, according to StatCounter data. This is still well below the share of Google’s Android.
Smartphone shipments in the country last year were also dominated by other companies like Samsung, Oppo, and Vivo, according to a report from IDC.
However, the research firm noted that sales of higher-priced smartphones – mostly controlled by Apple and Samsung – were the only ones to grow last year, logging a 78% year-on-year improvement.

Hello reader,
One of my New Year’s resolutions for 2024 is to read two books a month, and I’m on track so far.
I wish I could say the success so far is because I’ve become very disciplined, but the truth is much simpler. I moved into a new apartment early this year, and it doesn’t have a smart TV, so I’ve spent a lot less time watching TV shows and movies than last year.
It would amaze you how much less appeal Netflix has when you have to watch it on a tiny laptop instead of a big screen. Turns out, convenience is a big factor for me when it comes to streaming.
For Indonesian viewers, it seems like having access to local content is a big draw. At least, that’s what Vidio is betting on. The video-on-demand player reckons that a focus on local shows will help it beat out international competitors – and eventually reach profitability.
Today we look at:

For Vidio, the path to profit is local
J&amp;T Global Express hits profitability shortly after going public
Other newsy highlights such as Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, Sr.’s plan to invest in Japanese firms and HSBC Singapore providing a finance injection for Akulaku.


Premium summary
Vidio takes on the (streaming) world

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Indonesian video-on-demand player Vidio claims to have surpassed heavyweights like Netflix, Viu, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, and WeTV across several categories in its home market.
However, the Emtek Group-owned firm is still seeking profitability in an extremely competitive space.


Streaming wars: Sutanto Hartono, managing director of Emtek Group, says the price competition in the video-on-demand industry means a relatively low average revenue per user. This makes it tough for companies in the segment to achieve positive margins. Case in point: Vidio recorded a total loss of about US$42.7 million in the first three quarters of 2023.

Local flavors: Vidio’s outlook report found that 59% of Indonesian video-on-demand users prefer local content over international shows. Hartono said the firm has been investing in producing original “sinetron” (local soap operas) for its platform to take advantage of local tastes. From 2022 to 2023, Vidio produced 51 original TV series via collaborations with production houses in Indonesia.

Friends in high places: Vidio partners with a wide range of companies in Indonesia, from telecom firms to electronics brands and ecommerce platforms. It also has the backing of big-name investors such as Affinity Equity Partners, which injected US$150 million into Vidio in November 2021.

News spotlight
Profit, via express delivery

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Logistics giant J&amp;T Global Express has posted its first-ever positive adjusted EBITDA, hitting US$146.7 million for 2023.
The milestone comes after the firm went public via an IPO that raised US$451 million in October last year.


Part and parcel: The company credited the result to a 29% year-on-year increase in parcel volume across its 13 markets, hitting 18.8 billion parcels in 2023.

To Southeast Asia with love: Southeast Asia was J&amp;T’s biggest profit driver, with the region accounting for US$375.7 million in adjusted EBITDA for 2023. Meanwhile, the firm’s Chinese business recorded a profit for the first time, hitting US$30.7 million in the same metric for the year.

Playbook: The company said it has been bringing strategies from its China business to its operations in Southeast Asia. This appears to have paid off, as J&amp;T said unit parcel cost in Southeast Asia fell 11.8% in 2023 compared to the year before.

Photo credit: ID Atsit

Adam Neumann, the co-founder of embattled WeWork, is attempting to reacquire the office-sharing business through a bid valued at over US$500 million, Reuters reported, citing a source briefed on the discussions.
The specifics of how Neumann will secure the necessary funds for this acquisition remain unclear, as the negotiations are private, the person added.
Currently, WeWork is navigating bankruptcy proceedings, and its current goal is to restructure to become a profitable and financially sound business by the second quarter.
It was previously speculated that Neumann might collaborate with hedge fund Third Point and other investors for a unified bid. Third Point, however, mentioned that discussions with Neumann are only in their preliminary stages and that no financial agreements have been established.
Neumann was ousted from WeWork in 2019 after scandals regarding his managerial tactics – which involved prioritizing accelerated expansion over financial stability – and personal misconduct surfaced.
WeWork’s valuation has since plummeted from its previous high of US$47 billion. The company’s attempt to enter the public market this year was also halted.
WeWork’s financial struggles and the decreased demand for office spaces, amplified by the pandemic-induced remote work shift, further intensified these concerns.

Well hello there,
As a techie who grew up during the Silver Age of television, you’d probably assume I love video-on-demand (VOD).
And I do, because the Silver Age sucked. There were three stations (maybe four if you had a good antenna), and while there were some iconic shows from that period, it was difficult to find something decent on TV outside of prime time.
Silver Age? It should’ve been called the “there’s nothing on” era of television, because that was the phrase you actually heard people say.
It wasn’t until Netflix went digital in 2007 that things started to get good for video content.
But now, after almost 17 years of VOD, we’re still struggling to find something good to watch.
There is no lack of good content; instead, we have a new problem. All the great shows coming out are spread out between 70+ streaming services, most of which require a paid subscription.
This frustrated trip down memory lane is brought to you courtesy of this week’s first Big Story. My colleague Budi looks at the VOD sector in Indonesia, and especially at the position of Emtek-owned Vidio, who claims to have beaten Netflix in the country.
Our second Big Story looks at ByteDance, another company known more for what it does on the mobile screen. Collin looks at why TikTok’s parent company is ramping up its genAI hires in Singapore.
And finally, I’ll talk you through the recent rise of bitcoin. Has the cryptoverse finally gone mainstream, or is it just more of the same old hype? But first, let’s get to those Big Stories.

THE BIG STORIES
1️⃣Emtek’s Vidio claims to have Indonesia’s streaming crown, but sees heavy losses

Indonesia has the highest compound annual growth rate for subscription-based VOD services among Asia-Pacific countries, but Vidio faces stiff competition from global players.

The Chinese tech giant recently put up over 100 job openings for generative AI, largely in Singapore and the US.

TOKEN ISSUE
Will the selloff in bitcoin ETFs kill the token’s recent hot streak?
Bitcoin is back – and so is the constant speculation on its price.
Will it hit US$100,000? US$1 million? Or is this another pump and dump scheme?
The latest bitcoin rally started in August 2023, following speculation that the US Securities and Exchange Commission was going to approve bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which would allow investors to put their money in the digital currency without actually having to buy it.
The decision, sparked by a US court ruling, opened the cryptoverse to institutional investors. The approved ETFs started trading in the first week of January.

Image credit: Timmy Loen

In just four months, bitcoin, which had been trading as low as US$16,500 at the start of 2023, shot up to US$47,000 by January 2024. In February, the token surged again on news that investment firms were buying it up. Last week, it hit a new high of US$73,097.
But along with the new high, the cryptocurrency’s well-known volatility also returned. Starting on March 18, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, the largest bitcoin ETF, saw record net outflows of US$742 million in a three-day selloff. This caused bitcoin to fall as low as US$60,700 at one point.
The selloff was interrupted by news that the US Federal Reserve could cut interest rates in June. Bitcoin rallied on that news to US$67,500 by Thursday and then fell again on Friday to end the week on a downward trend.
If those price fluctuations haven’t given you whiplash, this likely will. Next up on the bitcoin calendar is “the Halving,” although I prefer the more dramatic sounding “the Halvening.”
On or about April 20, the Halvening will reduce the amount of new bitcoin that the system generates by half. The Halvenings are hardcoded into bitcoin’s protocol and have been a function of the system since it began.
The bitcoin blockchain does this every time 210,000 blocks are added to the chain, which on average takes about four years. In 2009, the blockchain could add as many as 50 new bitcoins every 10 minutes, but three Halvenings later – which happened in 2012, 2017, and 2020 – the rate of new coins dropped to 6.25 bitcoins every 10 minutes.
In April, this will drop to 3.125 bitcoins every 10 minutes. This process will continue until the number of bitcoins in circulation reaches 21 million, estimated to be sometime in 2140.
You’re probably wondering: why? Wouldn’t slowing the rate of new bitcoins and capping the total number of coins cause prices to spike without adding any value?
No one really knows why Satoshi Nakamoto created the Halvening events, but proponents of the reduction process argue that it is designed to prevent inflation and “ensure long-term feasibility and functionality.”
And yes, bitcoin prices have spiked after every Halvening, although the effects always seem to be short-lived.
Not surprisingly, speculation is rife. Some analysts are predicting bitcoin will hit US$120,000 or higher by the end of the year, while others are predicting the coin could fall as far as US$42,000.
But the market has never seen a Halvening following a selloff. The Halvenings have also never encountered an ETF or worried about whether the Fed was going to cut interest rates. And the institutional investors aren’t going to HODL if things get crazy.
I really don’t know where the price of bitcoin is going to go, but you can expect the volatility to continue.

Investments in the country’s startups grew tenfold from 2013 to 2023 as collaborations between corporations and startups became the norm. On top of that, the Japanese government introduced the Five-Year Startup Development Plan in 2022.

While ambitious, its goal was simple – to create 100 unicorns and 100,000 startups in Japan.
In line with the central government’s plan, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government announced a new strategy, Global Innovation with Startups, in November 2022.
The centerpiece of this strategy was the creation of a startup hub known as Tokyo Innovation Base (TIB), which was intended to become a nexus where startups and their supporters from across the globe can gather and interact.
Pioneering a collaborative startup ecosystem
From the ideation stage, TIB engaged in open discussions with startups, accelerators, experts, ecosystem builders, and economic organizations.

This way, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government could get a diverse range of contributions and perspectives even before it put pen to paper, cutting down on the need to make major pivots down the line.
“We wanted to put our words into practice. Instead of presenting a vision created by the government, we wanted to co-create this vision with the wider ecosystem through open discussions,” an official from TIB shares.
Launching an innovation base for Japan
TIB’s initial launch on November 27, 2023 was a huge success; over 800 accelerators, venture capitalists, large corporations, financial institutions, and entrepreneurs from all over the world attended TIB’s pre-opening kick-off event. Yuriko Koike, Governor of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government attended the event and delivered an opening talk.

The event included informative sessions with international guests, an exhibition showcasing startup products, and one-on-one investor meetings at TIB.
Through its newly launched services, TIB aims to provide hands-on support for all aspects of a startup’s journey and serve as a one-stop service for international entrepreneurs looking to establish their startups in Japan, says an official from TIB. For that reason, TIB also offers services in English.
TIB has since kept the momentum going, collaborating with various partners to host events almost daily. More than 150 partners have worked with TIB to organize events and other activities catered to both Japan as well as the global startup ecosystem. By March 2024, about 100 events have been held in partnership with TIB, bringing together more than 10,000 guests.
To further strengthen the local tech ecosystem and serve the community, TIB has also opened its doors to members of the public as long as they’re registered beforehand.
A bright future ahead for Japan’s startups
With collaboration, growth, and eliminating obstacles in mind, TIB continues to grow its pipeline of activities, in line with its mission of becoming a “node” for innovation worldwide.
For instance, it’s set to collaborate with universities across Japan to support student and youth activities. TIB will be present at student-led events and ideation sessions to create an inclusive space where all can participate and to foster connections with various players in the ecosystem.

“Driving collaboration across the ecosystem is a large priority for us at TIB. One of TIB’s goals is to continue facilitating innovation between large companies and startups,” shares the official from TIB. “Leading Japanese companies, including Sony, have already participated in sessions with a focus on transforming management mindsets and enhancing collaboration.”
In addition, TIB is set to further support hardware-based startups by creating an advanced fabrication space fully equipped with 3D printers. It has also established relationships with entities like DMM.make Akiba, a co-working space equipped with manufacturing facilities, and Garage Sumida, a manufacturing consultancy.
TIB will continue its agile development, with plans being laid ahead of its grand opening in May. These plans include the launch of additional services and facilities such as ‘FAB’, which will be catered towards supporting hardware startup prototyping, as well as ‘SHOP’, which will facilitate marketing testing for food and B2C startups.
“While ‘Tokyo Innovation Base’ is physically situated in Tokyo, we want our support to reach beyond and encompass the entire innovation ecosystem in Japan,” says Manabu Miyasaka, Vice Governor of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government.

Two of the region’s largest ecommerce players are doubling down on “buy now, pay later” (BNPL) services, even as this short-term financing product is undergoing a reckoning.
Indonesian tech company GoTo said on March 19 that it is preparing to launch a BNPL product with social media platform TikTok, months after it struck a deal to merge its ecommerce unit Tokopedia with TikTok Shop.
Do these two companies know something about the sector that other players don’t?
BNPL firms are faltering, throwing the relevance of the service into question. Yet, a select few operators of large marketplaces could find value in ramping up the offering within their ecosystems.
Diverging paths
Billed as one of the hottest opportunities during the pandemic-induced tech boom, BNPL has lost its luster.
Singapore startup Pace filed to wind up its business in August 2023, even after it acquired the assets of competitor Rely to increase its market share. Australia-listed BNPL player Zip exited the Singapore market the same year.
Customer rewards platform ShopBack in March discontinued its service PayLater, which it had launched after acquiring BNPL player Hoolah in November 2021.
Word on the street was that Hoolah was running out of cash before ShopBack bought the startup. As the economy soured, dampened consumer demand and the persistently high cost of funds meant even ShopBack could not keep it alive for much longer.
Amid this turmoil, however, TikTok was planning to use BNPL to drive purchases by letting users pay for their orders over a few months instead of upfront – and typically with zero interest.
Last July, TikTok announced a partnership with fintech startup Atome to offer installment payment options on its ecommerce platform in Malaysia.
TikTok’s collaboration with Indonesia appears to be a continuation of that strategy, and rival platforms are doing the same.
GoTo Financial head Thomas Husted said the fintech unit wants to be the preferred partner of TikTok Shop. At the same time, GoTo is planning to deepen its consumer loan offerings on its own app.
Sea’s ecommerce arm Shopee plans to expand its BNPL service to all users, while raising the credit limit of existing customers. The company made the decision after finding that younger users – 32 years old and below – often abandoned their shopping carts because the items were above their budgets.
Shopee also plans to offer its BNPL service to physical stores through merchants that already operate an online shop on Shopee.
Marketplace opportunity
Will a BNPL offering as part of an ecommerce marketplace be more viable than a standalone company offering the service?
Sea does not break down the numbers for its financial services business, making it difficult to gauge how much consumer lending has contributed to its growth. The figures that are available, however, paint a positive picture.
As of December 31, 2023, outstanding loans to consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises were up 27% to US$3.1 billion.
Revenue from the fintech segment, while small relative to total revenue, was up 44% in 2023 – more than any other segment.
BNPL expansion is not a strategy that works for every marketplace operator, though.
Indonesia’s Bukalapak gave up offering pay-later loans in February, demonstrating that it takes more than just a captive audience to succeed.
Indonesian consumers may lack access to credit, but they also have a great deal of choice. BNPL service providers also need to be operators of marketplaces with large transaction volumes and recurring users.
BNPL works best if users already have a high propensity for spending on the platform and are tempted by incentives to increase their basket sizes.
The size of the marketplace also matters because processing massive volumes of transactions every day gives operators more visibility into credit risk. Platforms could also channel certain users to other types of higher-margin cash loans.
TikTok’s foray into BNPL may be particularly potent. It has a captive audience of young consumers who use the app daily – the perfect demographic for BNPL, which targets Gen Z and millennials who value flexibility and do not always tap into traditional credit.
Though TikTok Shop is a new entrant to Southeast Asian ecommerce, it has already taken market share from incumbents. It may not be long before it becomes a challenger in the fintech arena as well, seeing that the biggest ecommerce players have always evolved along this path.
A BNPL service may just be the first step. The product is often the easiest entry into financial services, given that it is uncomplicated and largely unregulated in Southeast Asia. TikTok’s operations in the region may become more valuable as its fate in the US grows more uncertain.
As for pure-play BNPL providers without an ecosystem, the clock is ticking. A number of companies are attempting to diversify into more sophisticated forms of financial services, such as digital banking.
These players need a good grasp of how to navigate a tricky market where it is up against listed tech majors or risk never making it to the finish line.

TikTok’s future is unclear in the US, with the country mulling a ban of the app unless it splits from its Chinese parent firm ByteDance. However, Zhang Yiming – ByteDance’s founder and a major shareholder – is resisting any potential sale of the short-video platform, Caixin reported.
Should it be approved, the bill would give TikTok 180 days to branch away from ByteDance or leave the US market. The US House passed the bill earlier this month, but it will have to be voted on by the US Senate before being made into law.
Despite the situation, sources close to the matter told Caixin that ByteDance is not looking for potential buyers, as the company doubts a deal could be made in time.
The company already views the US bill’s conditions as equivalent to a ban, the sources said. For a sale to be made, a deal would need the green light from Chinese regulators, which is unlikely, according to legal experts.
In the worst-case scenario, TikTok may have to abandon the US market, leading to a probable decrease in ByteDance’s value as well as an increase in investor pressure.
As of April 2023, TikTok had over 116.5 million active users in the US aged 18 and above – its target advertising demographic. This represents the app’s largest market worldwide, followed by Indonesia with 113 million users and Brazil with 84.1 million.
ByteDance’s situation may serve as a warning to other companies with Chinese ties that are operating in the US, as they may struggle with following the country’s laws.
In Southeast Asia, TikTok has also received scrutiny from local regulators. Last year, Indonesia released social commerce rules that led to the temporary closure of TikTok Shop, while a Malaysian government official said that TikTok’s efforts to follow local laws were “unsatisfactory.”

Japanese lending platform Crowd Credit has partnered with Singapore-based fintech firm Helicap to channel US$50 million from Japanese investors to Southeast Asian firms.
Through the collaboration, Helicap will connect potential Southeast Asian borrowers with Crowd Credit and help nurture the latter’s relationship with financial institutions in the region. Crowd Credit will also link investment opportunities in Japan to Helicap.
“This partnership will allow us to further expand our investor base and provide Japanese investors with access to a hugely growing market with stable returns,” said Helicap co-founder and CEO David Wang.
Previously, Helicap linked up with Credit Saison to deploy US$10 million in impact debt financing into Southeast Asia. However, the partnership was made with the international arm of the Japanese financial services group, Wang clarified.
In an email, Wang added that his company may also raise equity funding soon. He told Tech in Asia that the new funding will likely happen within the next six months.
Since its inception in 2018, Helicap has raised over US$300 million from investors through its bases in Kuala Lumpur, Paris, Dubai, and Singapore. The company said that it has achieved stable returns and maintained a zero default track record using a unique credit screening system and loan structure.
Meanwhile, Crowd Credit provides private lending opportunities to individual investors, concentrating on Japan. It also offers debt capital in several sectors, including non-bank financial institutions and renewable energy firms via its online crowdfunding platform in Japan.

Photo credit: ByteDance

The Chinese tech giant has posted over 100 job openings related to generative AI largely based in Singapore and the US. Close to 40 of the open positions were for LLM roles in the city-state.
Large language models – also known as foundational models – are a type of AI that can generate content like text, images, and videos through the use of prompts. They are trained using large data sets and are built to have machine learning capabilities.
A majority of ByteDance’s new LLM jobs are related to training, safety, and data acquisition.
A reason why the company is interested in Singapore and US specifically is due to the availability of talent in these countries, a source with knowledge of the matter tells Tech in Asia.
The job openings in Singapore are across the different teams that are integrating and testing out the AI capabilities for the firm’s various products, says the source.
These hires will be working on ByteDance’s own Chinese LLM model – called Yunque – which powers its ChatGPT-like app Doubao. They’ll also help develop the company’s other generative AI apps, which are tested using other foundational models such as OpenAI.
ByteDance’s Doubao offers services like chatbots, English learning support, writing assistance, AI generated images, and coding.
In January, a Forbes report revealed that TikTok had also quietly launched four generative AI apps in the span of three months, which were also benchmarked using OpenAI’s technology. The apps – Cici AI, Coze, ChitChop, and BagelBell – were developed for markets outside of China.
Another factor that could’ve played a part in the hiring spree is ByteDance’s relative sluggishness compared to other Chinese giants, with rivals such as Alibaba and Baidu having released their own LLMs much earlier.
Tech in Asia has reached out to ByteDance for comment.
Last December, OpenAI suspended ByteDance’s account after a report by The Verge alleged that the Chinese firm had “secretly” been using OpenAI’s technology to develop its own foundational model.
The report cited internal ByteDance documents that said it used OpenAI’s API in various phases of development for this model, which had the code name “Project Seed.”
However, ByteDance denied the report and said its teams were only using the US company’s tech to a “limited extent” for testing and evaluating its own LLM.
While its account with OpenAI remained suspended, ByteDance still has access to OpenAI’s APIs via a Microsoft Azure license.

With increased scrutiny in global markets, especially the US, it seems that ByteDance is sticking to using foundational models by other firms to develop its AI apps instead of going with its own LLM for global markets.","The Chinese tech giant recently put up over 100 job openings for generative AI, largely in Singapore and the US.",Collin Furtado,Editing by Miguel Angel Cordon and Jaclyn Tiu ,open,0,"",https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698640810_0-cb0d883e8d2c1c45bafb93eb7cd64468.png,false,"",false,true,true,true,false,2,,476,"ByteDance eyes Singapore for genAI push, posts several job openings","The Chinese tech giant recently put up over 100 job openings for generative AI, largely in Singapore and the US.",,,"","",""

Malaysian fintech firm Soft Space has raised new capital through a partnership with GMO Financial Gate, a Japanese payments major and longtime partner of Soft Space.
This collaboration is a precursor to the Malaysian firm’s upcoming series C funding round and is aimed at advancing the adoption of cashless payments in Japan.
The partnership also follows Soft Space’s US$31.5 million series B1 round in April last year. At the time, the company said it had almost doubled its revenue from 2021.
The previous raise included a US$5 million commitment from Japanese financial services firm JCB, which allowed Soft Space to link Japanese customers to Southeast Asia.
“Our ability to deploy rapidly from Malaysia to Japan and beyond showcases our agility and market readiness,” said Joel Tay, CEO of Soft Space.
The company was founded in 2012 and has since grown to serve over 90 financial institutions and partners across 30 global markets. According to Tech in Asia data, the company has secured a total of US$36.5 million in disclosed funding to date.

Photo credit: Anton Zubchevskyi / Shutterstock

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the Philippines is set to move forward with the blocking of crypto exchange platform Binance in the country, according to local media reports.
The watchdog had said that it received approval for its filing with the Philippines’ National Telecommunications Commission (NTC), which requested to remove local access to Binance’s main website and other related platforms.
SEC chairperson Emilio Aquino said in a letter to the NTC that Binance is a “threat to the security of the funds of investing Filipinos.” The SEC had said that Binance has been offering services such as crypto savings accounts and leveraged trading products in the country without the necessary licenses.
While the total number of Filipino Binance users remains unknown, data from consumer intelligence platform GWI estimates that there are over 9.3 million crypto owners in the Philippines, good enough to rank it 7th worldwide.
The SEC has been publicly warning Filipino users against Binance as early as November 2023 – just days after the company’s former CEO Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty in the US to breaking anti-money laundering laws.
In the same month, the SEC also expressed its intent to ban Binance in the Philippines within three months, but the move was delayed due to a reshuffle in the government body’s leadership.
Around this time, a Binance spokesperson confirmed to Tech in Asia that Kenneth Stern – the head of Binance’s operations in the Philippines – had exited the company in July 2023.

Singapore-based Anext Bank has received US$148 million in added capital from its parent company Ant Group, according to data from Alterntives.pe, which tracks regulatory filings.
This follows the US$188 million that the digibank received from Ant Group in March last year.
According to Alternatives.pe, Ant Singapore SME Services – the entity that has a 100% shareholding in Anext Bank – has invested over US$503 million in the digibank.
Tech in Asia has reached out to Anext Bank for comments.
Ant Group set up Anext Bank after winning a digital wholesale bank license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore. The bank focuses on local and regional MSMEs, especially those dealing with cross-border transactions.
In June 2023, the company said that 65% of its clients were considered micro businesses. It added that of its total client base, 33% were businesses incorporated just two years before opening an account with Anext Bank.
Another digibank that has been strengthening its war chest is GXS Bank, which is owned by Grab and Singtel. Earlier this year, Grab poured US$109 million into the bank, which followed a US$101 million injection in July 2023.
As opposed to Anext’s digital wholesale bank license – which is geared toward companies catering to SMEs – GXS Bank was awarded a digital full bank license, which lets it focus on retail customers.

Hello reader,
I still feel like I’m a little on the younger side (feel free NOT to correct me), so I wasn’t around back in the ‘70s or ‘80s when Singapore had yet to find some of its footing. As such, I grew up in relatively peaceful, prosperous circumstances, with the only exception being the Great Recession in 2008.
These days, I complain a lot on social media about government policies, especially when it comes to social issues. However, I have a lot of respect for how it has been very prudent in handling our money, and Temasek falls under this category too.
Without any natural resources, one of the most important ways for the country to stay financially secure – beyond its human capital – is to use money to make more money. As such, entities like Temasek have always been key in maintaining that secure environment I grew up in. And as the firm gets more involved as a venture builder, it can only be a good thing for our tech sector.
Today’s premium story takes a look at the role it plays in Singapore’s startup space, laying out all its investments and related activities with various tech firms in an excellent visual story. If you’re a sucker for beautiful data, this one’s for you.
Today we look at:

What’s Temasek cooking?

Image credit: Timmy Loen

With around US$300 billion in assets, I’m reasonably certain Temasek knows its stuff. As such, it’s great to see that it hasn’t forgotten about startups and is actively trying to get involved with them. My colleague Collin Furtado digs deeper in this story.


Growing the oven: Just three years ago, Temasek’s role as a venture builder was rather small, as it only had nine companies under it. Today, that number has skyrocketed to 50, with 15 of them being startups. 

Fine, I’ll do it myself: This momentum of creating its own startups has led to Temasek launching a venture-building company called Menyala in 2022.

Money isn’t the only green it wants: The firm sees a lot of opportunities in climate tech – the majority of its funding deals in the last three years have gone to startups in the sector. It has also launched two climate tech firms: Climate Impact X and Sydrogen Energy.

It’s a fish eat fish world

OK, fine, I’ve never actually seen a fish gobble up another fish in real life. However, I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t morbidly curious – circle of life and all. Oh well, I guess I’ll just have to settle for reading about how Indonesian aquaculture firm eFishery acquired DycodeX, a local AI-powered IoT startup.


Ai, ai, ai, little butterfly: Terms of the deal were not disclosed, although it’s clear that it will help eFishery expand its AI plans. 

Chomp: Currently, eFishery has rolled out an AI-powered product called eFeeder. It also operates a feed marketplace and a B2B platform for fish trading. 

The long road ahead: Following the acquisition – which will see DycodeX’s team be integrated into eFishery’s – the aquaculture firm is planning a two- to three-year roadmap where it would launch 10 new products, which will include IoT platforms, a generative AI solution, and more.

Apple held early-stage talks with Baidu about the possibility of incorporating the latter’s generative AI technology into the former’s products in China, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources briefed on the situation.
This is part of Apple’s broader initiative to enhance its AI features and adhere to Chinese regulations, which require AI models to be pre-approved by the government.
It would also save Apple the trouble of developing AI services in the Chinese language, especially with local rivals already having a leg up in this regard, analysts told WSJ.
The sources added that the discussions with Baidu are not yet conclusive, and it’s uncertain whether Apple has reached out to other Chinese AI firms.
If a partnership materializes, Baidu can help Apple compete in the Chinese market better with companies like Huawei.
While Apple has held a strong grip on the Asian country’s smartphone market over recent years, many local customers have been switching to Huawei. The Chinese firm launched its flagship Mate 60 Pro last year amid US sanctions, which state media applauded.
Meanwhile, Apple is also focusing on expanding its research and development efforts in China, with plans for a new lab dedicated to product innovation. In addition, the firm is gearing up for the rollout of its Vision Pro headset in China soon.

Despite a significant improvement in revenue, Indonesian ecommerce firm Bukalapak missed its target to turn profitable in 2023 due to investment losses stemming from Allo Bank.
The company logged adjusted EBITDA for Q4 2023 at negative US$2.9 million, improving by 80% year on year.
“Our record performance in 2023 enabled us to come very close to reaching our quarterly adjusted EBITDA breakeven target in the final three months of 2023,” Bukalapak president Teddy Oetemo said in a statement.
A factor in Bukalapak missing this milestone is its investment in Allo Bank, which dragged down the ecommerce firm’s performance.
Tech in Asia noted in its analysis last year that the company’s first-quarter performance in 2023 was impeded by the continuously dropping share price of Allo Bank.
That said, the ecommerce firm’s main growth drivers continued to improve their revenue contribution to the company.
Bukalapak’s marketplace business reported a 47% year-on-year increase in revenue to US$141.6 million in 2023. Meanwhile, its offline to online business grew by 11% during the same period to US$138.5 million.
“We’re getting ever more confident in delivering our main goal of turning profitable on a quarterly basis imminently, having posted eight sequential quarters of adjusted EBITDA improvement,” Oetemo added.
For 2024, Bukalapak is targeting a 15% to 20% improvement in revenue. It also expects adjusted EBITDA to reach over US$12.7 million for the year.
Oetomo said that the company seeks to continue maintaining “cost discipline” moving forward. Just last February, Bukalapak shut down its buy now, pay later service, BukaCicilan, after almost six years of offering the product.

841855,2024-03-25T08:35:28,2024-03-25T08:35:57,Southeast Asia’s ecommerce players go low to get ahead in price war,southeast-asias-ecommerce-players-go-low-to-get-ahead-in-price-war,publish,post,https://www.techinasia.com/southeast-asias-ecommerce-players-go-low-to-get-ahead-in-price-war,"In mid-2023, a platform called Choice was launched on Lazada in Southeast Asia with little fanfare. No press releases were sent out, but the Alibaba-owned company’s help center says that Choice aims to “bring the best value products of the world to Southeast Asian consumers.”
The Chinese tech titan introduced Choice across its international ecommerce platforms last year, beginning with its global cross-border unit AliExpress in February, Lazada in August, and South Asia-focused Daraz in October.

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Choice is Alibaba’s attempt to emulate low-cost platforms Temu and Shein by collaborating directly with manufacturers and subsidizing them to reduce prices. Temu, the Boston-headquartered unit of China’s PDD Holdings, expanded to the Philippines in the same month as Choice’s rollout on Lazada and then entered Malaysia in September.
Qoo10, a relatively lesser-known ecommerce firm based in Singapore, set its sights westward, acquiring US discount retailer Wish for US$173 million in February 2024. Can Qoo10 revive the once-popular Wish and bring it to this part of the world?
For now, these developments signal a brewing price war in Southeast Asia’s ecommerce sector. Could the so-called “dirt cheap” segment become the new battleground for these tech players?
How cheap is cheap?
The Choice page, which can be accessed within the Lazada app, displays products priced as low as 1,000 rupiah (US$0.064) to 30,000 rupiah (US$1.90) in Indonesia. In the Philippines, the prices range from 4.3 pesos (US$0.077) to around 159 pesos (US$2.84). The platform also offers shipping and bundle discounts to customers who buy three products.

In its latest earnings call for the quarter ending December 2023, Alibaba reported that AliExpress had recorded a quarter-on-quarter order growth of over 60%. This surge was primarily driven by AliExpress Choice.
Tech in Asia has contacted Lazada for comment on its Choice platform and reached out to Qoo10 to learn more about its acquisition of Wish, but both companies have not responded.
Joe Zhang, founding partner at Chinese ecommerce consulting firm Sailer Partners, believes that Southeast Asia is already saturated with affordable products. Still, Temu and other players could intensify the price war, potentially pushing prices down by another 10% to 15%.
See also: Why SEA should watch out for Shein’s top rival Temu
To provide ultra-low prices, Temu uses what the industry calls a “fully managed” model. Under this approach, the company takes care of everything from warehousing to customer service, enabling it to dictate pricing on behalf of Chinese manufacturers.
It has also been leveraging the capacity of its sister company, Pinduoduo, which has an extensive network of sellers in China. This facilitates Temu’s ability to get goods from factories and merchants that offer the lowest prices.
﻿
Temu has become one of its parent firm’s biggest weapons, contributing to a recently reported stellar quarter. In Q4 2023, PDD generated US$12.35 billion in revenue, beating analysts’ estimate by US$1.35 billion.
﻿
Similar to Temu, Lazada Choice mostly sources its products from China. The only exception is Indonesia, where the platform has to secure goods from local manufacturers due to regulations prohibiting cross-border ecommerce.
To attract Choice sellers in Vietnam, Lazada takes 0% commission, disburses fast payouts, and gives prominent product placement, among other incentives. This initiative is called Lazada Choice Shop, but it is unclear whether it is available in the company’s other Southeast Asian markets.
“Any new player that promises lower prices, whether through subsidies or cheaper products, will be relevant and compelling to consumers in Southeast Asia,” says Simon Torring, co-founder of market insights firm Cube Asia.
Who can compete?
However, Torring notes that Temu might have a less disruptive impact on Southeast Asia compared to TikTok Shop.
A key factor in Temu’s initial success is its ability to offer “good-enough quality at an amazing price” to customers in the West, a value proposition that has long been popular and familiar to ecommerce consumers in Southeast Asia, he says.
Since its August 2023 launch, Temu’s user base in its two markets in the region – Malaysia and the Philippines – has not grown rapidly. This suggests that the company is not prioritizing and investing heavily in marketing for Southeast Asia.
﻿﻿
This stands in contrast to Temu’s lavish marketing expenses in the US. During the Super Bowl in February, it plunked down US$21 million on three commercials that lasted 90 seconds in total.
Given Temu’s presence in 53 markets, “it seems logical for them to pause further rollouts and concentrate their resources on the most promising regions, such as the US and European Union,” says Ed Sander, a digital tech analyst who runs content site ChinaTalk.
Nevertheless, Temu and other discount players will still put pressure on Shopee and Lazada to maintain competitive pricing in Southeast Asia, predicts Sharon Gai, author of China-focused retail and ecommerce book Ecommerce Reimagined.
Zhang of Sailer Partners also pointed out how it’s difficult for marketplace platforms to compete on pricing since fully managed players can control the supply chain.

Shopee returned to losses in the Q3 and Q4 of 2023 after posting positive adjusted EBITDA in the three previous quarters. This outcome came after the company committed to ramping up livestreaming investments to fend off competition from TikTok Shop and other rivals.
While it might be tough for Shopee to offer ultra-low prices as it pursues profitability, Sea Group CEO Forrest Li believes that his ecommerce firm is “the most price-competitive platform in the market.”
During Sea’s earnings call for Q4 2023, Li cited Shopee’s “slightly better bargaining power” when setting prices with sellers, attributing this to its ability to sell a higher volume of products compared to other marketplaces.

Meanwhile, Alibaba seems to be betting on Choice to revitalize Lazada’s ecommerce glory as competition in the space heats up.
Jiang Fan, CEO of Alibaba International Digital Commerce (AIDC), referred to Southeast Asia as a “very important market” in the company’s Q4 2023 earnings call. According to Tech in Asia’s calculation, Alibaba invested US$1.8 billion in Lazada in 2023.
Fan also stressed that Alibaba will make a “large investment” in Choice, as it believes that the new model is delivering “much better user retention.”

However, one can’t entirely overlook Wish despite being past its glory days. The US-based company had implemented “bottom-barrel pricing” ecommerce in the West to pull down prices to the lowest point possible, according to Torring.
When Wish went public in 2020, its valuation was US$14 billion – 81 times higher than its eventual sale price to Singapore’s Qoo10.
Wish’s downfall was mainly attributed to quality control issues. So even with the backing of Singapore’s Qoo10, Wish could face similar challenges in the region if it decides to enter Southeast Asia, Torring added.
Profitability issues and regulatory hurdles
Without substantial volume, achieving profitability could remain elusive for companies solely competing on price.
Temu, for instance, is not yet profitable. The company’s overall loss rate was around 40% on orders globally, but it had already improved to 30% to 35% in the US, according to a December 2023 report from Tech Buzz China.
Marketing expenses and logistics are the biggest contributors to these losses. Tech Buzz China noted that Temu’s marketing budget in 2023 was around US$2 billion to US$3 billion.
So far, only Shein appears to have turned profitable. The ultra-fast fashion firm claimed to have posted profitability in the first half of 2023, driven by its sales momentum in the US. Also, its recorded annual revenue reportedly exceeded US$30 billion in January.

Consumer spending in Southeast Asia, however, does not match that of the US, making it challenging to replicate the volume and scale seen in the West. Furthermore, Shein mostly concentrates on the fashion segment, unlike other players that offer a broader range of items.
Gai, the author of Ecommerce Reimagined, says discount players can take inspiration from Taobao, a company that started out selling cheap goods but eventually became profitable.
She notes that Taobao became profitable after amassing a sufficient consumer base and transitioning into a branded merchant model called Tmall, where most of the profit comes from advertising.
Perhaps this is what TikTok Shop and Tokopedia – which officially merged in December 2023 – could do in Indonesia as numerous brands have official stores on the latter. Tokopedia’s adjusted earnings turned positive at US$14.2 million in Q4 2023, according to the latest financial results of its parent firm, GoTo.
See also: TikTok Shop gets winning hand in Indonesia via Tokopedia mega deal
In Indonesia, the situation is more complicated. Apart from banning TikTok Shop temporarily last year, Indonesia also announced in September 2023 that it was prohibiting the sale of goods below US$100 through cross-border ecommerce.
This led AliExpress to halt its shipping services to Indonesia while Shopee and Lazada ceased their cross-border operations within that year. In 2021, Shein exited Indonesia, reportedly due to the country’s strict customs policy.
What will happen next in Southeast Asia’s ecommerce scene is anyone’s guess. One thing is clear, though: This price war will make consumers grow accustomed to discounts.
Ecommerce players may have no other choice but to offer bargain prices as consumer spending weakens.

Hello reader,
Taking on the likes of Netflix, Disney+, and Amazon Prime Video is a daunting task.
All three have huge user bases, voluminous libraries of content, and hefty war chests to make life tough for competitors. Yet in Indonesia, video-on-demand (VOD) player Vidio is up for the challenge.
The firm, which is owned by local conglomerate Emtek Group (EMTK, IDX), claims it’s the country’s top VOD platform by several measures.
That said, Vidio is still trying to stanch heavy losses. Its leaders, though, feel the company is on the way to turning a profit. So how has Vidio kept pace with the Netflix’s of the world? The company says it’s by going local.
The firm focuses on content like “sinetron” (local soap operas) over international shows.
That might be a timely reminder for the multitude of companies and investors excited to make it big in a promising market like Indonesia: It pays to think and act locally.

THE BIG STORY

Emtek’s Vidio claims to have Indonesia’s streaming crown, but sees heavy losses
Indonesia has the highest CAGR for subscription-based VOD services among APAC countries, but local firms face stiff competition from global players.

3 Trends to keep an eye on
Hot stocks, earnings reports, restructuring, pressure from activist investors, and more.

1️⃣ GoTo goes from red to green: Indonesia’s GoTo Group (GOTO, IDX) started 2023 facing some pretty big losses. Its latest earnings results show that the company managed to turn things around.
The company recorded adjusted EBITDA of US$4.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, bouncing back from US$197 million in adjusted losses in Q4 2022.
CEO Patrick Walujo said in a recent earnings call that 2023 was a “transformative” year for the company. The firm pulled off a blockbuster merger involving TikTok Shop and GoTo’s ecommerce unit, Tokopedia, and is aiming to balance profitability and growth.
2️⃣ PDD and Tecent’s big 2023: Last week, two of China’s biggest listed tech companies released their financial results for the fourth quarter of 2023 and the entire fiscal year. Both saw growth in some key metrics.
PDD Holdings (PDD, Nasdaq), which owns ecommerce platforms Pinduoduo and Temu, saw its 2023 revenue hit US$35 billion, a 90% increase from 2022.
Meanwhile, Tencent (700, SEHK) recorded a full-year operating profit of US$23 billion for 2023, 44% higher than the year prior.
3️⃣ IPO no-go = uh oh!: A whole lot can go wrong when taking a company public, and if it doesn’t pan out, there are consequences. That’s what a couple of firms found out recently.
Freshippo, the grocery arm of Alibaba Group (BABA, NYSE), scrapped its plans for a Hong Kong IPO last year amid poor market sentiment. That may have had something to do with why founder Hou Yi was replaced as CEO by former CFO Yan Xiaolei.
A source told Bloomberg that Hou will move to a senior advisor role at the company. That’s likely a softer landing than what’s awaiting the retrenched employees of Pan-Asian insurance firm FWD.
The firm also scrapped plans for a Hong Kong IPO last year. Now, close to 10 of the company’s staff members in Singapore have been laid off, sources told Tech in Asia.

The co-founder, president, and CEO of Nvidia (NVDA, Nasdaq) held court last week at the chipmaker’s developer conference. There, he shared his thoughts on some of the hottest topics in the tech world, largely around the AI industry, which his company is a leading light in.
Huang talked down fears of a US-China tech war disrupting the chip supply chain, going as far as saying that “the doomsday scenario is not likely to happen.” Of course, as head of a company reliant on chip production by the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), he does have some skin in the game.
In addition, Huang tipped India to be a key player in the future of AI thanks to its large number of IT professionals who could reskill and make their country the “front office” of the AI revolution.
Unsurprisingly, the typically leather jacket-clad CEO jokingly expressed Nvidia’s openness to doing business with India, which has plans to procure 10,000 graphics processing units and create an AI marketplace. Always be closing, baby.

That’s it for this edition – we hope you liked it!
Happy investing and see you next week!

A quarter after going public, logistics giant J&amp;T Global Express has posted a positive adjusted EBITDA for the first time, hitting US$146.7 million for full-year 2023. This comes as its China business turns profitable three years after entering the market.
Best known for its last-mile delivery service, J&amp;T credited the growth to a 29% year-on-year increase in parcel volume across all of its markets globally. The figure stood at 18.8 billion parcels in 2023.
The company also acknowledged that the market has improved in 2023, after a sluggish economy in 2022 due to rising inflation.
Business in Southeast Asia continued to be J&amp;T’s biggest profit driver after bringing in US$375.7 million in adjusted EBITDA for 2023.
Meanwhile, the China business turned profitable for the first time in 2023, with US$30.7 million in adjusted EBITDA for the year.
J&amp;T noted how social commerce has become a “growth engine,” benefiting all its delivery services. “As an emerging model of ecommerce, social commerce has successfully led the transformation of consumer behaviors,” it said in its annual report.
The company added that it has also started applying strategies from its China business to its operations in Southeast Asia, allowing it to improve its operational efficiency in the region.
“It’s a strategy that has been proven effective,” the company said, highlighting the “11.8% year-on-year decrease in unit (parcel) cost in SEA in 2023.”
Citing data from consumer research firm Frost &amp; Sullivan, J&amp;T said that its market share in Southeast Asia reached 25.4% of parcel volume, the largest in the region. Meanwhile, the equivalent figure for its China business is 11.6%.
Founded in 2015 in Indonesia, J&amp;T has since expanded to 13 countries. In 2020, it launched its services in China under the Jitu Express brand, with the firm acquiring the parent of Chinese express delivery player Fengwang Express in March 2023.
J&amp;T raised over US$451 million from its IPO in October 2023. The company said at the time that it will use the funds for improvements on its current infrastructure and for its entry to new markets.

Hi readers,
Everyone’s heard of Elon Musk, the workaholic genius. Sleeping at the office and the never-ending hours of work at first seemed like the only way to build a successful company.
I used to admire that, but then I realized that most employees can’t sustain that kind of lifestyle. Generally, this type of founder expects the same hustle from their employees, which ultimately leads to higher attrition.
Of course, Musk’s businesses thrive and rake in the billions. Does the end always justify the means? That’s a tough question.
Now, there’s this rising star in India, Bhavish Aggarwal. He founded ride-hailing firm Ola, and it’s way more than just another Uber competitor.
Ola is profitable in its core biz: Ola Mobility, while Ola Electric is leading the country’s electric scooter market. The group even has its own foundational AI model. It makes you wonder how it keeps expanding so fast.
First, Aggarwal brought Musk’s hustle culture to India, making statements such as “our generation is destined to toil” and weekends being a Western import. (Ola Electric’s 47.5% attrition rate might be a side effect of this, though.)
Moreover, Ola doesn’t build everything from scratch. Its secret weapon is buying up other startups.
Need electric scooters? Acquire the best e-scooter company. Need a mapping system? Buy the best one out there. Want to add food delivery? Find a thriving food delivery app and make it yours.
That’s how Aggarwal, India’s version of Elon Musk, gets things done.

Hello reader,
I used to listen to a ton of podcasts. I could regularly keep up with five or six basketball ones and one on gaming, the latter of which regularly releases episodes which are over three hours in length.
Now, I only listen to the gaming podcast. Besides simply getting busier and having less time to listen to podcasts, I realized that the gaming one has endured because it gives me something that nothing else does – I really like the hosts. They’re extremely funny.
The basketball podcasts are alright, but since the meat of their content lies mainly in the basketball games themselves, I can get my fix from articles and other sources.
Additionally – and this is no slight to the people behind the pods – most sports podcasters and journalists can’t hold an episode on the power of their personality alone, even if they’re amazing writers.
This is a long-winded way of saying that every medium demands specific skillsets to shine, even if the base material (e.g., the latest news in basketball or gaming) is the same.
I would assume India-based Pocket FM is at least somewhat aware of this fact, seeing as it leads our funding deals this week.

Behind the Glasswall

Fundraising often involves reaching out to multiple contacts, many of whom founders might not have dealt with before. To provide some transparency to this process, we created Glasswall, a platform for founders to give feedback and recommendations on investors. Check out the full list here.

❌ “Completely disorganized. They get a bunch of people on a call or in a room together to hear the pitch and are supposed to have someone in their group advocate for you. Ends up being really disorganized, with follow-ups with lots of people that ask to invest $10k – $50k, many of them not knowing how to make a decision and just waiting for someone else in the group to make a decision or support it.” – Read more

✅︎ “Humble investors with strong integrity which is frankly rare these days. They don’t pretend to know everything about your sector nor your business but comes with wisdom only an institution can provide.
Mostly take bets on founders given that they are early stage. liked the process even though they are much more valuation sensitive than majority of the market but at least they don’t act like a douche or pretentious prick that gives you wrong advice.” – Read more

Thoughtful reads
1️⃣ Managing sales
Managing sales teams brings all sorts of challenges, and sometimes it can feel like putting numbers to a job that involves a lot of non-number things. How do you fully quantify the value of a business development rep who knows the specific intensity of matcha ice cream that a client’s son likes?
Well, I don’t have the answer. But this Harvard Business Review article might.
2️⃣ Trickle-down economics?
I’ll cut to the chase with this one: this PitchBook piece posits that with family offices handing over the reins to the next generation – not to mention copious amounts of money – much of that will find its way to VCs and subsequently tech startups.
The reasons? These younger heirs have greater awareness and support of innovation, and they possibly want to invest in industries outside of the traditional purview of their family office.
3️⃣ The business behind – and around – the Oscars
Did you catch the Oscars? Personally, I’m not too fussed about the awards themselves – I can enjoy a movie without it having won anything.
What is interesting to me is what the event portends for the future of entertainment and the business around it – which is exactly what this episode of Masters of Scale is about.
4️⃣ Lessons from an exit
Everyone wants to read about successful startup exits, especially straight from the founder’s mouth. That’s the dream, after all – build a thing and sell it for big money and then enjoy the time and financial freedom.
Anyway, here’s a former founder’s story on exiting his software startup.

1. Healthy revenue growth
The company recorded 2023 revenues of 277 billion yuan (US$38 billion), up by 25.8% compared to the previous year. For the fourth quarter, revenue grew 22.6% year on year to US$10 billion.
These figures were driven by a 23.9% year-on-year increase in total on-demand delivery transactions, which hit nearly 22 billion.
2. Improved operating profit
Meituan’s operating profit improved significantly for 2023, reaching US$1.9 billion. This recovered from a loss of about US$805 million in 2022.
The improvement was due to cost of revenues, research and development, and general and administrative expenses declining as a percentage of revenue, although this was partially offset by a proportional increase in selling and marketing expenses.
3. Strong cash position
The company had a strong cash position at the end of 2023, with cash and cash equivalents of US$4.6 billion and short-term treasury investments of US$15.5 billion. This indicates Meituan’s sufficient liquidity to support its operations and invest in future growth opportunities.

The Strides DST team / Photo credit: Strides DST

Strides DST, also known as EVCo, is under insolvency due to a S$50 million (US$37.1 million) debt, reported The Straits Times.
OCBC Bank, as the main creditor, is owed S$47.6 million (US$35.3 million) by Strides DST, according to a document obtained by The Straits Times. The van leasing firm also has dues to SMRT, one of its key shareholders, worth roughly S$39,000 (US$29,000), while several entities associated with Strides are owed around S$590,000 (US$437,000).
However, accounting and business advisory firm Baker Tilly, which was appointed as liquidator, said that Strides DST is in insolvent liquidation – a process done to close a company that cannot repay its debts. Currently, the company’s assets include its fleet of electric vans, which have already depreciated in value.
Stakeholders including OCBC Bank and SMRT gave no additional statements to The Straits Times, with OCBC Bank refusing to comment due to Singapore’s Banking Secrecy Act.
A creditor, wishing to remain anonymous, blamed “poor management, poor execution, and exploiting loopholes” for the current situation.
Strides DST is a joint venture between Singapore-based vehicle services provider Strides Mobility and Chinese fleet management firm DST. It provided EVs to corporate clients and offers other services like vehicle maintenance and decarbonization planning.
The development comes just months after the company’s ex-CEO Fuji Foo and ex-CFO Janice Low were arrested concerning a police investigation over irregularities in the business.

Indonesia-based online lending platform Akulaku has a commitment of up to US$100 million in debt financing from HSBC Singapore.
“This deal reinforces our commitment to support new economy businesses as they move along the different growth stages and expand across the region,” said HSBC Singapore’s Shaun Sakhrani, head of structured banking for Southeast Asia.
Reuters first reported on the news, citing Akulaku CEO William Li. The new financing will be used to pay off some of Akulaku’s current debts, the report added.
This comes weeks after Indonesia’s Financial Services Authority (OJK) removed restrictions on Akulaku’s buy now, pay later service. The firm previously faced limited operations following alleged violations of the supervisory obligations that the OJK requires of BNPL offerings.
The company last raised US$200 million from Japan’s Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group in December 2022. Other past backers include Siam Commercial Bank and Ant Financial.
Aside from BNPL, Akulaku’s services include virtual credit cards and wealth management offerings. It also offers digital banking services through Bank Neo Commerce.
Akulaku’s latest raise follows several exits from the BNPL space across the region. Recently, Bukalapak said it shuttered its staggered payment offering BukaCicilan. ShopBack also discontinued its paylater service, while Pace filed for liquidation in November last year.

Hello reader,
As recent as a decade ago, it would have been unthinkable to go about my daily business without my wallet. It contained things that facilitated my life. Eating at a hawker center? Cash. Traveling around? Concession card. Ran out of cash? Just pop my ATM card at the nearest dispenser. I’m sure many of you had similar experiences too.
However, everything changed when mobile-based payments showed up. Only hawker centers and coffee shops held out for a time, but they eventually adopted QR and contactless payments.
Today, I can basically do everything I want through my smartphone, be it taking the bus or buying lunch. QR code payments, in particular, are almost essential because of how ubiquitous they are in Singapore, thanks to platforms like Paylah or PayNow.
Something similar is happening in Vietnam too, as QR code payments are now available everywhere including  eateries, street vendors, and many more places. Today’s feature story explores not just what this means for local consumers but also its potential impact on players in the digital wallet space.
Today we look at:

Whether the humble QR code is the future of payments in Vietnam 
Nvidia’s new lineup of chips
Other newsy highlights such as AnyMind Group’s acquisition of Arche Digital and the shutdown of SG Bike.

What’s in the box?

It’s easy to see why QR code payments are so popular. They take only a few seconds to complete, and you don’t have to worry about having enough money on hand or dealing with an irritating amount of pocket change in your wallet. But how it will affect e-wallets and whether it can completely take over a country like Vietnam remain to be seen.


Leading the way: One of the main drivers for QR code payment adoption is VietQR, which was introduced in 2019 by the National Payment Corporation of Vietnam. In Q3 2023, payments via VietQR reached 100 million transactions per month.  

Through the hoop: Apart from competition from the likes of VietQR, digital wallet operators also have to contend with regulations. In Vietnam, all e-wallets must be linked to bank accounts and users must verify their identity by uploading a photo of a valid ID card or passport.

No butting heads: Still, e-wallets don’t necessarily need to go head to head with QR code payments. The former still offers useful services such as allowing users to pay bills, purchase tickets, place ecommerce orders, and more. Ultimately, each payment method serves different purposes.

If the current AI craze is like the gold rush of the 1800s, then Nvidia is the one selling pickaxes in the form of its hardware. Well, those pickaxes are about to get a lot better, as revealed during the firm’s recent developer conference.


Down the rabbit hole: Nvidia has just unveiled the GB200, a type of chip that makes use of the new Blackwell architecture. The GB200 is four times more powerful than its H100 counterpart, and Blackwell’s specialized “transformer engine” is optimized for AI models used in platforms like ChatGPT. 

With open arms: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said he sees India as a key player in AI, and the country’s large pool of IT professionals positions it as a “front office” of this tech revolution. 

Backseat drivers: The firm also announced a new line of chips designed for cars, which have the power to run chatbots inside vehicles. Chinese electric vehicle makers BYD and Xpeng have already committed to using these new chips.

Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, Sr. / Photo credit: Ohanian’s LinkedIn Page

Alexis Ohanian, Sr., co-founder and former chairman of social media platform Reddit, is pursuing tech-focused investment opportunities in Japan via his early-stage VC firm Seven Seven Six, Nikkei Asia reported.
According to Ohanian, Seven Seven Six will focus on startups designing and manufacturing processors centered around AI development. He expects competitiveness in Japan’s AI landscape to heat up, as the country would want to bolster its own capabilities in the sector to drive growth.
At the same time, Ohanian said he anticipates Japan-US relations to deepen over the next decade, despite “receding” globalization in other parts of the map.
Seven Seven Six’s initiative directly ties in with the US’s pursuit of an AI chip production line independent of Chinese tech.
There have already been moves to move production closer to Japan, including an investment from TSMC for a second factory in the country. US chipmaker Nvidia has also teamed up with Japan’s SoftBank for generative AI initiatives.
“It just behooves us to have the connections, to have the relationships [with Japan], because this is going to be a gateway to Asia,” Ohanian told Nikkei Asia.
A closer reach to the region may be a boon to the US, with countries like India and Singapore stepping up their game recently in the AI space.
Seven Seven Six said that it currently handles US$970 million in assets under management. Its portfolio includes blockchain platform Americana and foodtech startup BetterBrand.
Ohanian’s earlier venture, Reddit, recently launched a public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, reaching a US$6.4 billion valuation. On the first day of trading, the company’s shares went up 48%.

Well, it depends on who you ask and which metrics you use.
In its 2024 outlook report, Grab-backed Vidio, which is owned by local conglomerate Emtek Group and is nearly a unicorn, claims that it’s the cream of the crop.
The report says the firm beat regional and global players – such as Netflix, Viu, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, and WeTV – and emerged as the number one player across different categories.

According to Vidio, the report used some data from consulting and research firm Media Partners Asia (MPA). This included information on Vidio’s paid subscribers, which reached 4.1 million in 2023, outperforming other players in Indonesia.
However, a recent study by MPA says that Vidio is second to Netflix in terms of premium viewership (the amount of time customers spend on premium offerings) and monetization. MPA data also shows that Vidio captured 21% of Indonesia’s total VOD viewership in 2023.
The study reveals that apart from Indonesia, local firms also hold their own against international players in India and Japan.

According to MPA, Indonesia’s premium VOD segment – which includes subscription services – is valued at US$500 million. This accounts for 38% of the total online video sector’s US$1.3 billion value.
Between 2018 and 2023, the country saw the highest revenue growth for subscription-based VOD platforms, reaching a compound annual growth rate of 72%, although the absolute amount still trails other countries.

This comes amid increased subscriptions to high-speed mobile broadband services, MPA notes.
Moreover, 74% of Indonesians are willing to pay for streaming platforms, whether through personal accounts or shared subscriptions, according to research by data and insights firm Populix.

Around 65% of locals that are 13 to 24 years of age prefer streaming services over cable offerings due to several factors, including a more diverse range of shows.
In its study, MPA says that 25% of online users in Indonesia had used premium VOD services in the first half of 2023.
All this presents a lucrative opportunity for VOD platforms like Vidio.

Profitability in sight?
Sutanto Hartono, managing director of Emtek Group, recognizes the tough competition that Vidio faces from global firms, as these players are not limited in their access to viewers compared to previous tech like televisions.
New media platforms like YouTube and TikTok also compete for eyeballs and time.
In fact, the price competition in the industry means there’s been relatively low average revenue per user, making it hard for companies in the segment to achieve positive margins, Hartono said during a recent press conference.

In Q3 2023, Vidio recorded net revenue growth of around 40% year on year to reach 762.9 billion rupiah (US$48.5 million) for the nine months ending September.
However, its loss in the same period widened by about 53% year on year to 671.7 billion rupiah (US$42.7 million).

Hartono, who is also the CEO of Surya Citra Media (SCM) – the local media firm that operates Vidio, acknowledged that there were “anomalies” in the VOD company’s financials. These he attributed to the shifting of content consumption behavior in the market.
“For example, in one period, there is the World Cup content, while in another there isn’t,” he told Tech in Asia Indonesia during the press conference.
Nevertheless, Hartono is optimistic that Vidio is on track to achieve profitability. “If we eliminate those anomalies, we believe the group’s numbers are good,” he added.
To boost engagement with users, the company is prioritizing local drama series and seasonal sports matches that cannot be found anywhere else.
“Sinetron” is key
In Indonesia, local content is pivotal to successfully capturing VOD market share.
As many as 59% of Indonesian VOD users prefer local content over international ones, Vidio says in its outlook report.
“We’re always redefining which content is suitable and which is not, according to changes in user preferences,” Hartono said.

He stressed that since 2020, Vidio has been actively investing in producing original content in the form of “sinetron” (local soap operas) for its platform.
“We hope the production volume can increase, and this industry can grow even bigger,” added Hartono, though he did not disclose how much the firm is investing in this initiative.
From 2022 to 2023, Vidio produced 51 original TV series through collaborations with production houses in Indonesia. It aims to add at least 15 more titles in 2024.
These collaborations, the company acknowledged, are made possible because Vidio is a subsidiary of SCM, which also operates top local TV channels like SCTV and Indosiar.
Founded in 2014, Vidio was originally owned by Mediatama Anugrah Citra (Nexmedia) before being acquired by SCM in 2019. Both SCM and Nexmedia are subsidiaries of Emtek Group, an Indonesia Stock Exchange-listed company with a market capitalization of nearly US$1.7 billion.

Big backers
Besides partnering with production houses, Vidio has also linked up with numerous companies in Indonesia, from telecom firms to electronics brands and ecommerce platforms.
It also has backing from prominent investors, including Affinity Equity Partners (one of the largest Asian private equity firms), which injected US$150 million into Vidio in November 2021.
In June 2022, Sinar Mas Group, Grab, and Bali United – through their respective subsidiaries – poured US$45 million into the VOD platform. Hartono revealed that the company’s post-money valuation after that round reached US$945 million.
“Since that funding, we have not done any fundraising, so there have been no changes [in valuation],” said Hartono.

Besides competition with global players like Netflix, high piracy rates are another obstacle to growth, affecting subscription conversion rates.
In October 2022, Vidio reported a group of individuals to the police for allegedly disseminating its original content illegally through the Telegram app. The company estimated material and non-material losses totaling 40 billion rupiah (US$2.5 million) from the infringement.
Nevertheless, Hartono believes that with consumers switching from analog television to digital media, Vidio can attract more customers.
“Media digitalization is not yet complete. We see the penetration of smart TVs will continue to increase rapidly,” he added.

As it faces regulatory challenges in its primary market of the US, fashion giant Shein is modifying its business strategy to lend its small-scale, made-to-order system to third-party brands and suppliers, The Wall Street Journal reported.
Tagged as “supply chain-as-a-service,” this offering is set to enable external labels to use Shein’s platform for launching and testing new clothing items in small amounts.
This is a notable change for Shein, which gained its popularity by offering a wide range of its own affordable products.
It works with factories in China to produce and ship a range of styles daily. Suppliers fulfill orders within days, using real-time data to match demand and control inventory. This approach cuts storage costs and waste, consequently lowering Shein’s per-item price.
This development comes as the company’s attempts to file for an IPO in the US have been halted.
After applying privately for a US listing in November, Shein is now waiting for a response from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The delay has prompted the firm to explore other options, including a possible UK listing.
Shein is also facing Western scrutiny over forced labor concerns, and it’s competing against another Chinese company, Temu.
Despite these barriers, Shein announced record profits last year.
In 2023, Shein also expanded to the US, Mexico, Europe, and Brazil and broadened its product line. It announced key partnerships, acquired British brand Missguided, and took a significant stake in Forever 21 owner Sparc Group.

Filling that gap is Kuala Lumpur-based fintech firm Swipey.
Founded by former consultants Kalyana Mohan Teagarajan and Rouvin Thiruchelvam, Swipey is Malaysia’s answer to Singapore’s Aspire: a digital and accounting management platform for corporations to manage and organize their day-to-day receipts.

Swipey was incorporated in 2021 but officially launched its platform in March 2022. Today, it serves more than 1,000 companies nationwide, from a wide range of sectors. Many of these companies, Kalyana tells Tech in Asia, are in the digital economy space.
Despite being very young, Swipey has already been gaining traction. The startup was highlighted in Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim’s mid-term economic review speech last year as an example of an innovative company.
Swipey is looking to breakeven by November, but the firm’s chasing an August deadline, Kalyana tells Tech in Asia.
Current transactions processed on annualized basis stands at US$19 million and is expected to hit US$100 million in the next 12 months. Annualized recurring revenue has been growing year-on-year, Kalyana says. “US$1 million is breakeven and we are 2.5x away.”
The fintech is also moving beyond just serving small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to larger businesses, Kalyana adds. Swipey has in its roster a Malaysian telco, a hospital chain, and an education services provider.
Getting here, however, was an iterative process the founders undertook, built on their decades-long corporate experience.
Built on surveys and collaborations
The decision to get Swipey off the ground stemmed from Kalyana and Rouvin’s experience in consulting as well as managing money for institutional investors and family offices.
Kalyana, a robotics engineer, spent the first decade of his career working at General Electric (GE) in the UK, initially with corporate audit and subsequently with its oil and gas division. He left the organization in 2018 as commercial director of subsea equipment.
During his time at GE, Kalyana focused on improving business operations, including working on pricing and costing platforms to boost margins and revenue. When he returned to Malaysia, he worked as a consultant, and that was when he realized many of his clients had problems getting their finances in order.
He reached out to Rouvin who, as an investment banker and a former GE colleague, was facing the same back-end finance problems with his own set of clients. This led the duo to build Swipey.
But it wasn’t an immediate launch. Kalyana and Rouvin decided to test their hypothesis – that a finance platform was sorely needed – by surveying 125 companies that have worked with them before.
What they found out was that while businesses had access to the basics such as a bank account, other payment services were limited.
“Only 8% had corporate cards or access to them,” Kalyana tells Tech in Asia. That exercise led to Swipey’s first product – a corporate debit card in partnership with Visa.
To run the platform, Swipey collaborated with Malaysian mobile payments firm Fasspay, a licensed e-money provider. This allowed businesses to have a bird’s-eye view of all expenses on the Swipey app. Users are also charged a lower foreign exchange rate on international spending.

Transactions, including amount and type, can be set on each card to ensure less fraud. Recurring payments can also be set either via the card or invoice management. Complementing these services is a digital dashboard that shows real-time spending insights.
Today, the fastest a company could get a corporate debit card is under 22 minutes through Swipey, Kalyana says.
Swipey’s services are tiered: Freemium, Growth and Plus. The entry-level Freemium tier sees customers receive two virtual cards as well as access to the web and mobile dashboards. Physical cards and other perks – such as a budgeting tool and a feature that automatically detects potential duplicate payments for vendor invoices – are for premium users.
Swipey’s business model is proving to be an attractive proposition. The firm gained investments from the Sunway Innovation Labs Super Accelerator, Selangor Accelerator Programme, and Alpha Startups MyFintech Week 2022.
It was also named a recipient of Cradle’s CIP Sprint, which awards a grant of up to 600,000 ringgit (about US$127,500) that covers tech commercialization.
In addition, Swipey has been getting the attention of four digital banks in Malaysia, Kalyana tells Tech in Asia without disclosing names. The founder tells us that the banks are looking at a collaboration that includes offering some of Swipey’s services to banking clients.
Lean and cautious
Swipey operates with a 15-member team, including Kalyana and Rouvin. Half of them are dedicated to tech, while the others focus on product development and operations.
Rouvin tells Tech in Asia that growth has mostly come by way of word of mouth or by attending events. Social media marketing spends are low.
The idea to keep the team lean, Kalyana says, is because Swipey is currently running on the bootstraps. “We don’t have a sales team, and the DNA is to ensure that we keep to that operating rigor,” he explains.
Malaysia-based investors speaking to Tech in Asia say that while Swipey does have a home advantage, the firm’s biggest test is to ensure its offering is the product of choice – meaning staving off rivals.
The other challenge, investors say, is to ensure that customers use a broader range of Swipey services, especially its premium plans. SMEs and startups have a tendency to either stop using paid services or find cheaper alternatives, a Kuala Lumpur-based VC tells us.

Despite running a lean team, Kalyana and Rouvin still have their eyes on growth. Swipey has some angel funding and “will raise some money as we go along,” Kalyana says.
The tech winter has also affected Swipey as investors are taking “a bit longer to move,” Kalyana says. “But if you show them that you are growing very quickly and very disciplined, then you can definitely take conversations forward.”
As for expansion, Kalyana and Rouvin tell Tech in Asia that the company aims to serve businesses across Southeast Asia. That was the primary reason they decided to set up shop in Malaysia, which they argue serves as a good testbed given the country’s diverse population.
“We’ve got a little number we have in our head, like 30,000 businesses in Malaysia, 70,000 businesses in Asia, and so on. But those are just numbers. We don’t get up in the morning and say I want to be a unicorn. Instead we are focused on solving problems,” says Kalyana.

(Disclaimer: Timothy doesn’t actually exist – all similarities to actual persons are completely coincidental.)
But choosing the correct diamond isn’t that easy, with many factors to consider before he can make a final decision.
His first step? Research. Our protagonist opens a bag of chips, fires up the computer, and steps into the world of diamonds and gemstones.
The big Cs
The first thing he learns is the four Cs: color, clarity, cut, and carat weight. These are characteristics that are inherent to each diamond and indicate how valuable it is.
“Diamond grading using these guidelines is a very important process for consumers,” says Ian Kwan, director of Goldway. “They will usually look at the final grading certificate and use that to determine the real value of a diamond and how much they’re willing to pay.”

(From left to right) Ian Kwan, director of Goldway, together with Tony Hui, CTO of Goldway / Photo credit: Goldway

Timothy shares this mindset. “I’ve got to get the diamond that’s the most worth it within my budget,” he thinks.
Good for him then because since 2012, Goldway has been developing solutions to aid human graders and improve the grading process regarding two Cs: color and clarity.
“We’ve got an AI-based solution that captures high-quality images and analyzes the diamond’s color from those images. It then compares that with a color standard that’s set by a master stone,” says Tony Hui, CTO of Goldway. “This means that the solution can be aligned according to recognized grading standards set by authorities like the GIA (Gemological Institute of America) or jewelry brands.”
“But that’s only one part of diamond grading,” our hero thinks while opening his second bag of chips.
He’s right. Now, to assess clarity, Goldway applies an additional layer of AI and machine learning algorithms, which can detect any impurities or defects as well as illusory duplicates that come about due to the stone’s high refractive index.

One would be hard-pressed to fool these / Photo credit: Goldway

To develop this tech, the team at Goldway worked closely with partners in the jewelry industry to not only understand the grading process on an expert level, but also obtain a huge sample size of diamonds – two million, to be exact – to train its AI algorithm to detect these illusions.
The resulting AI algorithm is capable of detecting and recognizing different types of diamond defects, and can simulate a human’s grading process to suggest a possible grade.
“Developing this solution was a painstaking process that took us a few years to complete,” Goldway director Kwan says.
Tomato, tomato
Having started down this rabbit hole, Timothy can’t stop. As he clicks into the tenth Google result, he finds himself wondering why professional graders need the help of these tools.
Kwan points out that even though graders are trained extensively at official institutions, grading is ultimately a subjective assessment. Their opinions can be affected by environmental factors such as how well-lit the room is or even what time the grading is done.
Fatigue can affect a grader’s judgement too. As such, there isn’t really such a thing as being the “most accurate.”
“You can have grader A and grader B looking at the same diamond, and even if they’re sitting side by side they might give you different gradings,” he adds. “We’ve learned that on average, two experts grading the same diamond reach the same conclusion only six times out of 10.”
No blood on your hands
With Goldway’s tech in the mix, Timothy’s grateful that diamond grading has become a lot more reliable, but there’s still one niggling issue. Years ago, he watched a film called Blood Diamond. It left a lasting impact on him, and he’s become extremely concerned about diamond traceability. The diamond he chooses has to be not only authentic and natural, but also ethically sourced.
According to Kwan, traceability concerns are increasingly prevalent not just in the diamond industry, but across the board for consumers of other verticals too. As survey by Merck Animal Health showed, 86% of respondents who felt that transparency in their food products was important also rated traceability as extremely or very important.

When it comes to diamonds, many consumers don’t want their money to go toward funding war criminals or perpetuating child abuse – just like in Blood Diamond.
“Beyond the ethical considerations, they also want to make sure they’re buying natural diamonds,” he says. “There’s a lot of tech that can inexpensively create synthetic diamonds, which incentivizes people to make counterfeit products and pass them off as natural diamonds.”
“I definitely don’t want to spend this much money on a fake!” Timothy nods to himself, tearing open his third bag, this time in sour onion flavor.
Aided by lasers, experts deeply familiar with the chemical composition of diamonds help Goldway’s industry partners study diamonds. The experts look at the stones’ intrinsic properties – such as its impurities and carbon composition – to ensure that they’re not counterfeit.

Can’t get a closer look than this / Photo credit: Goldway

Getting to this level of technological sophistication was not easy, and apart from his team, Kwan credits these capabilities to Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation, which gave the firm the space and facilities it needed.
“We didn’t have to worry about things like installing a ready supply of nitrogen gas or distilled water,” he says. “All of this provided the critical infrastructure we needed for R&amp;D.”
Big brain science
Timothy walks away from his computer a more knowledgeable customer.
“But wait,” he pauses, washing the chip dust off in the sink. “Can’t we just use tech to grade diamonds exclusively? Then I can get my diamond so much faster!”
While the solutions Goldway offers are really helpful, Kwan and Hui emphasize that grading will always remain the domain of humans. After all, its AI algorithms are trained on human graders’ judgements, just expanded across a huge dataset. Additionally, Kwan points out that top-level graders are often just as fast as tech-based solutions.

The key idea for applying tech to diamond grading and traceability is to help combat the inconsistencies that come with human fatigue and subjective opinions, allowing consumers to get more well-rounded information no matter who provides it.
Moving forward, Goldway aims to incorporate quantum technology to strengthen its traceability capabilities. This tech will allow its scientists and engineers to observe the carbon molecules’ nuclear or electron spin to determine whether a diamond’s natural or not.
“We’re also going to collaborate with some universities like Harvard and the University of Hong Kong to ensure that our tech is always up to date, allowing us to protect the natural diamond market,” says Hui, the firm’s CTO.
Timothy, for his part, hopes he won’t be unfortunate enough to require Goldway’s solutions for another engagement ring in the future. For now, though, he’s happy to pick up the phone and make an appointment with a local jeweler.

The Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation aims to foster the development of Hong Kong into a regional hub for innovation and growth.

EFishery, an Indonesia-based aquaculture firm, has acquihired DycodeX, a local AI-powered IoT startup. The deal, whose terms are undisclosed, will let eFishery expand its AI plans, which includes an upcoming brand called eFishery.ai.
The DycodeX team will join eFishery’s artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) and cultivation intelligence team, which is part of the unicorn’s product division. DycodeX co-founder and CEO Andri Yadi will lead the team as vice president.
With the new team, eFishery is planning a two- to three-year roadmap where it would launch 10 new products. They will take the form of IoT products and platforms, a generative AI product, as well as other aquaculture intelligence solutions.
Currently, eFishery has one AI-powered product called eFeeder, which allows its clients to enable automatic feeding for fish and shrimp cultivation. Other products include a feed marketplace and a B2B platform for fish trading.
“Andri Yadi and his team can strengthen and accelerate the implementation of AI and IoT in the eFishery ecosystem,” eFishery CEO Gibran Huzaifah said in a statement. The company further said that with Yadi and his team, it expects product development cycle to be 3x to 4x faster.
The DycodeX acquihire comes as eFishery’s in expansion mode. Last year, the company entered India – its first overseas market – while raising $200 million in series D funding, which boosted its valuation to US$1.4 billion.
As of January 2024, eFishery said it counts 200,000 fish farmers as clients.

Daniel Zhang, former CEO of Alibaba Group, is joining China-based VC firm Firstred Capital as managing partner – six months after leaving the Chinese tech giant. In his new role, Zhang will “explore a new future for merger and acquisition funds,” the firm said on its WeChat account.
Not much is known about Firstred Capital, which was founded in 2019 by Liu Xiaodan, formerly the chairman of investment company Huatai United Securities. According to its website, the firm has invested in the semiconductor industry as well as healthcare for both humans and animals.
The former Alibaba executive is bringing 16 years of experience to Firstred Capital, having led some of the most critical developments in the Chinese conglomerate. He led the transition of Tmall from a purely PC offering into a mobile app and spearheaded the idea of “Singles Day” in the platform.
Zhang – whose nickname at Alibaba was “the free-spirited one” – had become the firm’s group CEO in 2015 before stepping down in June 2023. He was initially set to continue leading Alibaba Cloud Intelligence Group – the firm’s computing services arm, but he surprisingly left the company in September 2023.
Zhang’s departure from Alibaba Group was part of its major restructuring, which began a year ago, amid an intensifying battle with the likes of PDD. While Alibaba was set to form six different business units and pursue an IPO for each, the company shelved plans to list its logistics arm and grocery chain in November 2023.

We break down the big and messy topics of Asia’s tech and startup community. Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a premium subscription.
Hello reader,
I’m not sure if it’s because of how I was brought up or if it’s an innate part of me, but I’ve always abided by the rules. I’m not a stickler for them, but I never strayed far from the policies at school or work.
(Unless it was something dumb like “don’t play football in the void deck after school,” which is a completely victimless infringement.)
I think there’s also a part of me that thinks it’s more clever – and therefore more exhilarating and satisfying – to find a loophole and exploit it. Sometimes, following the letter rather than the spirit of the law can be oddly more infuriating to opponents.
Regulators in the tech world, however, might not be so good-humored in responding to such techniques, if the number of crackdowns in the last few years are any measure. Today’s premium article focuses on some high-profile cases, why they happened, and what a more regulated tech industry could look like.
Today we look at:

The long arm of the law catching up to tech firms

Job cuts at ShopBack that affected 24% of its staff
Other newsy highlights such as GoTo’s profitable quarter and new startup-focused funds in Singapore and India

Rules are meant to be… followed?

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Are you in favor or against more regulation of tech? As someone who’s more of a consumer and observer rather than a practitioner of tech, I’m actually gonna be a goody-two-shoes and say that I welcome more regulation.
I mean, if the Grab and Uber merger had been prevented, we’d all probably still be paying below S$20 for taxi rides.
But of course, more rules also means constraints on tech’s growth. It might be simply a case of picking the lesser poison.


Politics, politics, politics: A lot of the clampdowns are politically motivated. The Chinese government, for example, is prioritizing “political and security concerns over rapid economic growth,” while similar moves in India and the US came shortly before election season.

Fines aren’t fine: Historically, fines alone have not been enough to deter  rich tech companies from behaving badly, thus leading to calls for stiffer penalties. Case in point: The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) decided to scrutinize Grab’s proposed Trans-cab acquisition a second time, even after the super app made unspecified commitments to address the regulator’s concerns.

Leveling the playing field: In the short term, other tech companies may benefit from the travails faced by their peers. In December 2023, online retailer JD.com won a lawsuit against Alibaba, which was found to have abused its market dominance by adopting a “choose one from two” exclusivity policy that forced sellers to list products on Alibaba exclusively. In the same vein, preventing Grab from increasing its ride-hailing market share via acquisitions may benefit smaller players such as Tada, Bolt, and Be Group, which are trying to scale their presence.

Cutbacks at ShopBack

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Temasek-backed ShopBack has reduced its employee headcount by 24% – cutting out 195 people – “to become more focused and self-sustainable as a company.”
The shock announcement was made by Henry Chan, the cashback and rewards platform’s co-founder and chief executive at a town hall meeting on March 19.


Way too fast, in my opinion: Those slated to be laid off were notified within an hour of the town hall’s conclusion. All departures were enforced on the same day “out of respect and to ease transition for departing team members.” The last in-office day for affected staff was March 19, 2024.

Some support, at least: Among other support measures, affected employees were offered payment for at least two months after their notice period. They will also be given an additional month’s salary as severance pay for every full year of service or based on local statutory guidelines, whichever is higher.

One would hope: Chan disclosed that ShopBack opted for “a reorganized and lean organizational structure” that would enable it to implement its strategy for sustainable growth. “Ultimately, I decided on a more substantial reduction to minimize the chances of us ever having to do this again,” he said.

The beverage was later renamed Pepsi-Cola in a bid to stay competitive.
This was the first in a series of reinventions that Pepsi has undergone throughout its 100-year history, culminating in its current form as PepsiCo, one of the world’s largest food and beverage companies.
It would be easy for a business like PepsiCo to rest on its laurels, but its journey so far makes it clear that reinvention is very much in the company’s DNA.
In fact, sustainability has become the name of the game, says Wern-Yuen Tan, CEO of APAC and chief commercial officer at PepsiCo.

“There is an urgency when it comes to sustainability concerns driven by the critical state of our planet but also by the expectations of our consumers, investors, and the communities we serve,” he says.
Where profits and purpose meet
PepsiCo isn’t new to the sustainability beat – it first started exploring greener processes in 2006 with its “Performance with Purpose” program. That saw the company shift to using all-electric vehicles, invest in renewable energy, and emphasize the role of grower-sourced crops.
However, intensifying environmental challenges such as climate change, water scarcity, and plastic waste are spurring the company to do more – and faster.

“Acting now isn’t just about avoiding the adverse effects of these global challenges but seizing the opportunity to lead and innovate for a sustainable future,” Tan shares.
Indeed, research shows that sustainable companies benefit from more value creation, lower costs, and other non-financial rewards.
PepsiCo experienced this for itself when it began cutting out the use of virgin plastics and incorporating more sustainable farming practices, which Tan says resulted in “more resilient and responsible supply chains.”
Going further with Pep+
In the face of mounting environmental challenges, PepsiCo has ramped up its sustainability efforts with its PepsiCo Positive (Pep+) strategy. Launched in 2021, Pep+ aims to transform the entire business – from how it sources its ingredients to how it creates and sells its products.
Many other businesses around the world are also trying to improve sustainability in this way. A study from Ernst &amp; Young found that eight in 10 supply chain executives are increasing efforts toward sustainability in their operations.
Tan explains that three pillars – positive agriculture, positive value chain, and positive choices – form the foundation of Pep+, which are underpinned by specific, time-bound goals.
For example, under positive agriculture, the company is encouraging the adoption of regenerative practices across the seven million acres of land that it uses to grow its crops and ingredients by 2030.

“We’re also aiming to reduce our value chain’s absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030, including a 75% reduction in emissions from our direct operations,” Tan says. The company is gunning to completely shift to more sustainable packaging and increase the diversity of ingredients in its products as well.
“We want to be able to offer choices that align with our customers’ evolving preferences and well-being but which also reflect our belief that the business must play a role in driving positive change,” he says.
Change across the chain
Since its implementation, Pep+ has been expanded across several components of PepsiCo’s supply chain, with renewables taking center stage.
In APAC, 97% of the electricity in the company’s owned operations comes from renewable sources. Apart from that, this year, the firm will open four greenfield facilities in the region – two in China and one each in Indonesia and Vietnam – that will be operating with net-zero emissions from the start.
Further, the company is supporting electrification by adopting more electric vehicles into its logistics processes. Its snacks business in China, for instance, increased the use of EVs between 2022 to 2023 and also boosted the distance travelled by its 37 electric delivery vehicles by 80%.
Additionally, it’s running several pilot projects: electric trucks are being rolled out in Thailand, while Australia is now a testing ground for using hydrogen fuel for long-haul routes.

Another focus for the business is investing in open innovation on new projects and inventions that line up with the company’s vision for a net-zero future by 2040.
For instance, the company’s Greenhouse Accelerator program supports APAC startups involved with the circular economy, sustainable agriculture, and climate solutions spaces. The winner of the 2023 edition, Powered Carbon, produces eco-friendly fertilizers with a 25% smaller footprint than its conventional counterparts, based on the early testing results.
As part of the accelerator program, participants also get one-on-one mentoring with PepsiCo’s senior executives, who work closely with these founders to assess and solve their unique challenges.
The program doesn’t just provide startups with access to resources or mentorship, but it also enables them to try out their innovations. Powered Carbon, for example, has tested its fertilizer on potatoes in PepsiCo’s Guangdong Farm in China.
Another participant, Adiona, trialed its SaaS solution for last-mile delivery route planning and optimization at PepsiCo’s Tingalpa plant. Early results showed a significant reduction in both distance traveled and carbon dioxide emitted from Tingalpa’s logistics routes.
In total, the 2023 edition saw seven pilot projects being launched, with more expected to come this year after the firm opened applications for 2024.
Digital for agility and resilience
What would a company’s sustainability strategy be without strong digital capabilities to empower it?
For PepsiCo, its digital-driven investments are spread across various solutions, including drone monitoring, smart manufacturing automation, and real-time data analytics.

These solutions enable more efficient decision-making and help PepsiCo maximize its resources. In China, for example, PepsiCo used soil analytics tech to “shorten feedback loops from months to days, helping farmers optimize fertilizer use to enhance crop yields and reduce input costs,” Tan shares.
That said, PepsiCo encountered “unique challenges” in trying to modernize its legacy infrastructure without disrupting its operations, he admits.
To overcome this, the company focused on rolling out changes in phases, as well as emphasizing investments that would have the biggest and most immediate impacts, such as upskilling its workforce.
More than an aspiration
Over the coming years, Pep+ and the sustainability agenda will continue to play significant roles in shaping the company. While it’ll take some effort, these initiatives are “investments in our future and the future of the planet,” Tan says.
Through Pep+, PepsiCo will remain focused on its goals to cut back its use of virgin plastics by 50% across its global portfolio by 2030, and to achieve net-zero by 2040. These aren’t just aspirations, he concludes, but they are commitments to building a brighter future.
“Ultimately, sustainability is a journey that requires collaboration, innovation, and a continuous commitment to improving.”

Pocket FM, an Indian audio entertainment platform, has raised US$103 million in a series D funding round led by Lightspeed, with participation from Stepstone Group. According to the company, its post-money valuation is US$750 million – nearly double its series C valuation.
The latest funding comes a little over a year after Pocket FM entered the US market. The firm said its 10 million users in the US are the most engaged globally, and revenue in the market has surpassed US$100 million in annualized run rate.
The company is gearing up for further global expansion, targeting Europe and Latin America in 2024. Currently, Pocket FM has more than 130 million users globally across more than 20 countries.
It also aims to enhance its original audio series offerings and “create a strong IP playbook,” while using generative AI to scale the offerings and develop personalized recommendations.
“We identified an unexplored space in the entertainment industry driven by an increasing demand for audio fiction and crafted a playbook to address this opportunity across every key market,” said Rohan Nayak, Pocket FM’s CEO and co-founder, in a statement.
Pocket FM said it has one of the largest repositories of exclusive audio series. It features over 100,000 hours of content, including 2,000 exclusive series and over 400,000 episodes across various genres and languages. This round has brought the firm’s total disclosed funding to about US$210 million, with investors including Tencent and Naver.

Zalora’s opportunity to become an ecommerce enabler for fashion brands
ShopBack layoffs a sign that the ecommerce hangover isn’t over
Sea’s upbeat outlook for Shopee – and whether or not it can live up to the hype

Hi there,
I’ve been accused of being an enabler. Nowadays, the term is used in the context of a person who supports someone else’s bad behavior. This often comes from a place of good intentions but is not a positive trait.
In business and tech, an enabler has a decidedly more positive meaning, referring to one that makes something possible.
Zalora wants to be that for brands looking to sell more online.
As my colleague Melissa notes in this week’s featured story, its experience as a fashion-focused marketplace can be an asset in helping brands with digital sales, especially in areas such as logistics. The big pain point in fashion is returns – about 24% of online apparel orders are sent back – and Zalora has the specialized skills and infrastructure to manage this process.
However, the market for ecommerce enablers in Southeast Asia is crowded, with players such as aCommerce and Synagie offering end-to-end solutions.
While Zalora’s background as a marketplace gives it certain advantages, it also leads to questions about whether it can support brands across all trade channels they want to sell on – even if this includes competitor platforms.
Meanwhile, in this week’s Hot Take, I look at ShopBack’s just-announced layoffs and what they tell us about the state of Southeast Asia’s ecommerce sector.
— Simon

THE BIG STORY
Zalora forges new identity as ecommerce enabler, seeks growth beyond marketplace

Between 2022 and 2023, gross merchandise volume of third-party brands using its fulfillment and last-mile delivery solutions grew over 300%.

THE HOT TAKE
ShopBack layoffs a sign of sustained ecommerce weakness

Photo credit: ShopBack

Here’s what happened:

ShopBack reduced its headcount by 24%, with the job cuts affecting 195 people.
Co-founder and CEO Henry Chan said the layoffs were an “absolute last resort.”
The cashback platform is aiming to “become more focused and self-sustainable.”

Here’s our take:
Layoffs are difficult decisions, and ShopBack’s co-founder said it was “one of the hardest” he had to make in the company’s history.
One out of every four employees has been affected, similar to the job cuts at ecommerce platform Lazada earlier this year.
However, ShopBack’s severance package is less likely to raise eyebrows compared to Lazada’s panned initial offer.
In addition to a minimum of two months of pay in lieu of notice, those affected will also receive one month of pay for every full year of service, as well as a bonus equivalent to one month of pay.
An employee who has been with ShopBack for two years, for instance, would receive around five months of salary as severance pay. This may seem like cold comfort, but it would provide them with some buffer as they look for new opportunities.
Chan told employees that he opted for “a more substantial reduction” in order to “minimize the chances of us ever having to do this again.”
While morale will definitely take a hit, this should assuage the concerns of those who remain with the company and is preferable to rolling layoffs.
These job cuts are a hangover from the era of low interest rates and the pandemic, which supercharged ecommerce transactions. As Chan acknowledged, from 2021 to early 2022, “the economy favored expansion over sustainability,” and he “made the mistake of pursuing too many directions” and expanding too rapidly.
The downsizing of the industry has affected all aspects of the ecommerce chain, from sales platforms to logistics providers, as well as companies like ShopBack that offer ancillary services to the sector.
Ecommerce firms will have to find ways to double down on their strengths or explore new lines of business – hopefully ones that offer higher margins.
There are tentative signs of a recovery. Both Shopee and Tokopedia have reported growing merchandise volumes in their most recent quarter – up by 15% and 5%, respectively, from the previous one.
Yet, the environment remains uncertain, and both firms have become more cost-efficient by squeezing other players in the ecosystem.
Unfortunately, we wouldn’t be surprised to see more layoffs to come.

As India grapples with public health issues, including World Health Organization estimates of 77 million adults with Type 2 diabetes, its healthtech market is on the rise. Some startups focus on health monitoring, such as diabetes-focused Sugarfit.
Another player is Ultrahuman, which sells wearable devices and services to help users track metabolic health. It is known for the Ultrahuman Ring Air, which tracks heart rate, heart rate variability, and blood oxygen saturation, among other indicators.
The company has raised a series B round of US$35 million in a mix of equity and debt. Participants include VC firms like Blume Ventures, Steadview Capital, and Nexus Venture Partners, as well as Zomato founder Deepinder Goyal.
Ultrahuman’s platform integrates data from its different devices, enabling users to monitor multiple health metrics simultaneously. While headquartered in India, the company’s products are available at over 150 stores worldwide – including one at Singapore’s Changi Airport.
The company expects to surpass US$100 million in annualized revenue run rate by the end of 2024. It said that it is profitable, though it did not disclose specifics.
“Our relentless focus on improving user experience through continuous firmware and software updates is what sets us apart,” said Ultrahuman co-founder Mohit Kumar. He added that the company ships a new firmware version every two weeks, along with weekly app improvements.
Founders Kumar and Vatsal Singhal previously established ecommerce logistics startup Runnr, which was acquired by Zomato in 2017.

Investors and founders agree: Many startups don’t really have an exit strategy.
An exit strategy is a plan that gives a company’s investors an option to sell their stake in the firm to another party.
Exit events for startup investors include mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As), initial public offerings, and even liquidation for those that have filed for insolvency.
So the question is, when is the best time for a startup to exit?
Tech in Asia’s data below could provide the crucial perspective that both founders and investors need to make a well-timed and well-informed exit strategy.
If a startup, for instance, is currently in its series B stage and considering raising a series C round, it would be helpful to know if the exit percentage was smaller in the following stage.
The first chart above shows in which stage startups usually get acquired.
Here below is the time frame when startups in the region choose to go for an M&amp;A after their initial round of funding.

Singapore-based AnyMind Group has acquired Arche Digital, a Malaysia-based ecommerce enabler. The transaction is set to complete by June 2024 at an acquisition cost of US$1.5 million, AnyMind said in a statement.
This marks AnyMind’s second acquisition of an ecommerce enabler in the past 12 months, having bought Digital Distribusi Indonesia in May last year. The Singapore-based firm has made seven other acquisitions: four businesses in Japan and one each in India, Thailand, and Hong Kong.
Founded in 2015, Arche Digital provides end-to-end solutions to help businesses enter online marketplaces like Shopee and Lazada. According to its website, Arche Digital’s customers operate in industries like health and beauty, groceries, and electronics.
The acquisition lets AnyMind expand its business process-as-a-service offering in Malaysia, combining Arche Digital’s operational expertise with AnyMind’s software solutions.
“When considering M&amp;A opportunities, we evaluate the management team’s capability for leading the business in the medium to long term, and cultural fit, as well as synergy with our existing business,” said Kosuke Sogo, AnyMind’s co-founder and CEO.
After a brief delay due to market risks, AnyMind went public on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Growth Market in March 2023. Prior to listing, the company secured a total of US$91.7 million in disclosed funding from investors including JAFCO Asia, Line, and Mitsubishi UFJ Capital.

Singapore bike-sharing company SG Bike will cease operations on April 30 after it has decided not to renew its operating license, citing a “strategic shift in business direction.” As of today, the company has stopped registering new users and accepting credit top-ups.
It also announced an arrangement with rival Anywheel where SG Bike users may convert their existing credits for use in the Anywheel app.
This marks the end of a seven-year journey for SG Bike, a homegrown bike-sharing firm founded at a time when players – mainly from China – flocked to Singapore to try and imitate a boom in that country.
By 2019, as the city-state implemented a tighter regulatory grip, competitors Ofo and oBike wound down their Singapore operations. Both SG Bike and Anywheel were able to fulfill the regulatory requirements, with SG Bike acquiring China-headquartered Mobike’s operations in the city-state that year.
However, despite surviving the Covid-19 pandemic, SG Bike had been loss-making between its 2020 and 2022 financial years. The company had accumulated losses of US$5.5 million in FY 2022, its most recent available financial information.
SG Bike’s closure leaves Singapore’s once-crowded bike-sharing sector down to two players: homegrown Anywheel and Alibaba-backed HelloRide. Anywheel is currently the larger player, with 30,000 bikes and 1.3 million users.
Meanwhile, HelloRide secured a license last year to operate 10,000 bikes.

This article is best viewed on a desktop.
This is the updated version of the article which was first published on November 15, 2022.
Three years ago, Tech in Asia chronicled Temasek’s journey from an investor to a venture builder with the launch of its own startups. At that time, the Singapore state-owned investment major – which does not manage taxpayers’ money – had about nine companies under it, five of which were startups it launched.
In April 2023, that number has grown by over 4x to 38 companies, with 12 of them being startups. Today, this has risen further to 50 companies, with 15 of them being startups.
This figure excludes seven startups that the investment firm’s companies acquired: Dreamcloud and Decision Science Agency, which were bought by Temus; BasisAI, which was acquired by Aicadium last year, Sembcorp, where Temasek owns 49.6% stake in the firm, Rivulis, which was acquired in 2020, and Elements Material Technology acquired last year.
Besides startups, Temasek has about 20 investment firms and a venture-building arm. It is also involved in a number of projects such as NovA, a joint initiative by MAS and Singapore’s National AI Office on how to assess financial risk. Both Temasek and Aicadium are part of the project’s consortium of members.

The state-owned investment firm’s venture-building endeavor seems to have picked up steam over the last three years, though it founded its first venture as early as 1988 – Vertex Ventures. Temasek has created 18 startups and made two acquisitions since 2020.

This momentum of creating its own startups has ultimately led Temasek to launch a venture-building company called Menyala in 2022, which means “light up” or “ignite ” in Malay. Menyala aims to launch startups that make disruptive technologies accessible and useful. Its initial focus is on emerging areas such as Web3, creator economy, and virtual worlds and experiences.
The most recent startups from Menyala’s stable include Authentick, a platform that lets users buy digital collectibles or NFTs and check their validity, and search platform Splore. Earlier this month, Menyala led a US$4 million seed round into Authentick.
“The whole idea is, can we spark the next big set of disruptive businesses? Also, can we do this in a more systematic and scale manner going forward?” Pradyumna Agrawal, managing director for blockchain investments at Temasek, tells Tech in Asia. He adds that the firm has hired product leads, engineers, and designers, and it is working on the next set of problem statements in music, NFTs, gaming, and search, among other sectors.

Agarwal says that while Temasek will continue to invest in startups, the firm realized that given the emergence of technologies such as blockchain and AI, there was an opportunity to help accelerate the process of building businesses and ventures. “These are big bold areas where you cannot just have any small group of individuals come up and do it. It needs institutional heft and support,” he adds.
This can be clearly seen as most of Temasek’s venture-building efforts have been in spaces where the technology is still nascent and being developed.

Besides this, venture building also gives Temasek more control of the outcomes of these startups, which also makes them a relatively safer bet. Instead of injecting funds in an external startup working on decentralized tech, “venture building is the best way to deliver results,” said Song Hwee Chia, deputy CEO at Temasek International, in a previous interview with Tech in Asia.
Ren Yeong Sng, Temasek’s managing director of AI strategy and solutions, tells Tech in Asia that it is well-positioned for venture building as many of its startups are working on solutions that relatively take a longer time period to develop and hence require the long-term capital support, which the investment firm can provide.
That said, the sudden spurt into launching its own startups comes at a time when there has been high volatility in the market. The last three years have seen startups being impacted by macroeconomic conditions such as pandemic-led lockdowns, cryptocurrency crashes, and more recently the recessionary headwinds.
Temasek’s net portfolio value saw a 3% decline – marking a US$6 billion loss – in financial year ended March 2023.
The company was also tangled in FTX’s collapse, which resulted in it writing down its full investment in the crypto exchange. It had invested US$210 million in FTX for a 1% stake and US$65 million into FTX US for a 1.5% stake.
In such instances, having more control and transparency into a startup can lower the risk and enable Temasek to guide it past such headwinds.

That’s not to say that the risks of launching its own startups are any lower. As Chia noted in a previous interaction, such ventures may have higher risks, similar to investments in early-stage firms. However, “they bring about opportunities to grow alongside the companies,” he said.
That said, Temasek sees a lot of opportunities in climate tech as it has been making a big push toward sustainability. A majority of its funding deals in the last three years have gone to climate tech startups. It has also launched two firms in the space – Climate Impact X, a carbon credits marketplace, and Sydrogen Energy, a hydrogen energy firm – as well as an investment firm, GenZero, that invests in companies that aim to accelerate decarbonization. Temasek’s efforts in blockchain come a close second.
The company has also taken a keen interest in the agritech sector. It launched Rize, a firm that aims to tackle decarbonization in rice cultivation, in October last year with joint venture partners Wavemaker Impact and Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a VC firm backed by Bill Gates.

Besides this, the investment firm has also partnered with Bayer to launch vertical farming firm Unfold. It has invested over US$8 billion in the agri-food sector since 2013, having backed the likes of Indonesia-based eFishery and its unit Amber invested Singapore-based Glife in the last three years.
However, Temasek’s journey into venture building doesn’t come without support from the ecosystem. Being a large state-owned investment company, it has managed to join hands with 12 corporate firms, a majority of which are based in Singapore, to launch 11 ventures. These startups mainly operate from the city-state, with the only exception being Unfold, which is based in the US.

Some of the companies that Temasek has partnered with include the likes of DBS, Singapore Exchange, Bayer, and Standard Chartered. Out of these, DBS has been one of its biggest partners, being involved in setting up four of the firms: Partior, Minden.ai, Climate Impact X, and EvolutionX Debt Capital.

In terms of geography, most of Temasek’s own ventures are based in Singapore. However, when it comes to investments into startups, US companies claim a majority of its funding deals, closely followed by those based in Singapore and China.

While traditionally, venture-building firms launch startups with unique value propositions in the hopes that they could be sold off for good returns, it is unclear whether Temasek intends to adopt this approach with the startups it has built.
However, judging by its past record, it seems unlikely that the investment firm would want to build these startups in order to sell them. All of them are also built to function independently, so Temasek may not have the problem of managing too many firms.

1. Significant revenue growth:
The total revenue for 2023 was US$35 billion, which was a 90% increase from 2022. For Q4, PDD’s revenue of US$13 billion marked a 123% increase from the year-ago period.
Growth was driven in part by its Ireland-based unit Temu, which has been “shaking up” online shopping globally. However, PDD did not break out separate figures for Temu.
2. Sizable increase in operating profit:
PDD’s operating profit also surged significantly. For the full year 2023, it rose by 93% to US$8 billion, while Q4 growth saw a 146% increase to US$3 billion.
This also translated into cash flows, with net cash generated from operating activities worth US$13 billion in 2023 – nearly 2x more than a year ago.
3. Consistent R&amp;D spend:
PDD continues to invest in research and development, spending over US$1.5 billion in 2023. The company said it will continue its “high-quality development strategy” while remaining dedicated to “offering great value and exceptional service.”

Total revenue for the full year increased 10%, reaching 609 billion yuan (US$86 billion) in 2023. In Q4, revenue was up by 7% to US$22 billion from a year ago.
This was driven by Tencent’s video accounts unit, where total time spent by users more than doubled. Receipts from the company’s mini games – a casual games platform – also increased over 50%.
2. Strong growth in operating profit
The full-year operating profit of US$23 billion was 44% higher than in 2022, while Q4 operating profit rose 42% year on year to US$6 billion.
3. Increased capital returns to shareholders
Tencent plans to increase its annual dividend by 42% and more than double its share repurchases to over 100 billion Hong Kong dollars (US$13 billion) in 2024. This demonstrates the company’s commitment to returning capital to shareholders and may indicate confidence in its future performance.

Nvidia’s ongoing developer conference was a watershed moment for the AI industry. The company unveiled its powerful new Blackwell architecture, headlined by the GB200 chip, at the event in California.
This chip promises a massive boost for AI enterprises, with 20 petaflops of processing power compared to the company’s four-petaflop H100. Blackwell’s specialized “transformer engine” is optimized for the AI models underpinning platforms like ChatGPT.
Nvidia also focused on software by introducing NIM, which stands for the Nvidia Inference Microservice. NIM simplifies the use of older Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) for AI inference tasks, making it easier for companies to deploy their own AI models at scale.
Co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang, whose company is now the US’ third-most valuable, also shared his thoughts on several trending topics in the tech world.
US-China tech war
During the conference, Huang downplayed fears of a US-China tech war disrupting the chip supply chain.
He expressed confidence in continued collaboration with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), whose chip production is crucial amid ongoing geopolitical tensions between the US and China.
Nvidia’s CEO also hinted at a potential partnership with Samsung. The Korean giant’s high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips are crucial for building powerful AI hardware like the new GB200.
Nvidia is currently testing Samsung’s HBM chips, which may lead to Samsung supplying this vital component for Nvidia’s future AI products.
India’s role in AI ecosystem
Huang sees India as a key player in the future of AI. He highlighted the country’s large pool of IT professionals, who are perfectly positioned to reskill and set to make India become the “front office” of the AI revolution.
This means Indian professionals wouldn’t just handle routine IT tasks, but instead be actively involved in developing and using cutting-edge AI solutions.
Notably, the Indian government recently announced plans to procure 10,000 GPUs and create an AI marketplace. When questioned about India’s plan to import GPUs, Huang jokingly expressed Nvidia’s openness to doing business.
Huang also encouraged Japan to develop its own “sovereign AI” capabilities.
AI in the driver’s seat
Nvidia also announced a new line of chips designed for cars. These chips have the power to run chatbots inside vehicles, offering new possibilities for in-car interaction and assistance.
Chinese electric vehicle makers BYD and Xpeng have already committed to using these new chips.

The gaming industry, which PricewaterhouseCoopers expects will be worth US$321 billion by 2026, has seen a recent funding streak.
This month, India’s Nazara Technologies Limited pledged US$100 million for global expansion, while Animoca Brands announced a US$3 million investment in a gaming firm from the United Arab Emirates, as a way to expand into the Middle East and North Africa.
Now, India-based Liquidnitro Games has joined fellow gaming firms Pixelmelon, 9 Lives Interactive, and Imaginary Ones in raising funds in 2024. A two-month-old venture founded by former Electronic Arts executives, Liquidnitro Games secured US$5.25 million in a seed round led by Nexus Venture Partners, with participation from angel investors.
Based in Hyderabad, Liquidnitro Games helps partner game companies and publishers to transition into and run so-called “live service” games. Also known as games as a service (GaaS), this refers to games that are constantly updated with new content to keep players interested.
This offering also helps partners unlock the Indian market, turn ideas or intellectual properties into games from prototyping to launch, as well as co-produce games. Founders Sandeep Kowdley, Krishna Dhanekula, Arun Kunchala, and Suresh Manthena worked on titles like Tetris, Plants vs. Zombies, and The Sims.
The funds will be used to build a studio, make significant AI and technology investments to boost production pipelines, and offer live services capabilities at scale. The company says it is partnering with “global games companies” to explore opportunities in India and other markets.

Hello reader,
Presidential election years in the US always make for strange and fascinating political theater, and 2024 has been no exception so far.
For instance, who would have thought that former President Donald Trump would flip-flop on his stance on TikTok? Just four years ago he threatened to ban the app – now he’s opposing efforts to follow through on that threat.
Media coverage of the ban’s political implications has been done to death, but what of the impact on ByteDance? Fueled by TikTok’s global influence, ByteDance – as its recent financials show – could exceed Meta as the world’s top-earning social media firm.
We asked some investment analysts for their take on how this latest drama could play out for ByteDance. Watch this space for more to come between now and November though.
Today we look at:


A countdown for TikTok and ByteDance? 
Singtel eyeing cloud computing play with Nvidia tech
Other newsy highlights such as Alibaba’s grocery arm Freshippo hiring a new CEO after IPO blip and GrabPay to start accepting crypto in Singapore.

TikTok on the clock in the US?

TikTok’s days in the US may be numbered after the House of Representatives voted in favor of a bill that would force owner ByteDance to sell up or face a ban of the short-video app.
ByteDance has fought the bill hard, but what could its long-term effect be on the company? Tech in Asia to investment analysts and US-China experts to find out.


Upside financially: Ka-ming Lim, CEO and co-founder of Singapore fintech firm MoneyFitt, said there could be a positive spin to a sale for ByteDance and its shareholders. The company could relatively easily assuage concerns over TikTok’s Chinese ownership and go public with an IPO in the US. At the right price, the combined value of the private ByteDance and public TikTok could exceed ByteDance’s current worth.

Step back: On the other hand, the ban could blunt any IPO ambitions ByteDance has, according to Dr Wealth CEO Alvin Chow. He said that without TikTok, ByteDance would be more reliant on its Chinese platform Douyin – not an ideal position given investors’ caution about putting their money in China recently.

Political football: Sisi Song, who has investment experience at JP Morgan, Alibaba, and Bessemer Venture Partners, said the bill is the latest example of the weaponization of global Chinese companies by US regulators. This has already led to investors putting a discount on their valuation of TikTok to account for the regulatory uncertainty, Song added.

Singtel reaches for the cloud

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Singaporean telco conglomerate Singtel is launching GPU-as-a-service (GPUaaS) offerings in Singapore and other Southeast Asian countries later this year.
The cloud-based solution will offer customers access to graphics processing units (GPUs) on demand.


Household name: Singtel said its GPUaaS will be deployed through Nvidia H100 GPU-powered clusters that are operated in Singtel’s data centers in Singapore. Uses for GPUs include machine learning, graphics rendering, data processing, high-performance computing, and gaming.

Powering up: Singtel will be among the world’s first firms to use Nvidia’s GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchips upon receiving them early next year. Blackwell GPUs are said to deliver 30x faster real-time large language model inference than their predecessors.

Expansion plans: The firm plans to eventually run the GPUaaS out of its three upcoming sustainable AI data centers across Singapore, Thailand, and Indonesia.

GoTo Group began 2023 with persistent adjusted EBITDA losses and an “unsustainable” cash burn. But the year – which included the blockbuster merger deal involving TikTok Shop and Tokopedia – turned out to be a “transformative” one for the company, said CEO Patrick Walujo in GoTo’s most recent earnings call.
“We carried out a comprehensive strategy review that showed us a path to winning back the mass market segment and the volumes it brings,” Walujo said in the call, which came as the company achieved its first-ever positive adjusted EBITDA.
“Although this balancing of profitability and growth is an ongoing journey, in the fourth quarter, we saw some real success.”
Now, the focus will be on “execution,” Walujo said, referring to the the full integration of TikTok Shop and Tokopedia.
While GoTo ecommerce president Melissa Siska Juminto declined to disclose the post-merger gross merchandise value, she said the group is confident that they will meet “or even exceed our expectations” going forward.
While Teten Masduki, Indonesia’s minister of cooperatives and SMEs, recently said that TikTok Shop is still violating local regulations, Juminto stressed that the Ministry of Trade is the relevant body regulating Tokopedia’s operations
“Our objective is to achieve compliance while ensuring a seamless user experience. We are on track to complete this within the trial period – a fact that was recently acknowledged publicly by the Ministry of Trade representative,” Juminto said, referring to a previous statement from Isy Karim, the ministry’s director general for domestic trade.
GoTo’s partnership with TikTok doesn’t stop at ecommerce. GoTo Financial head Thomas Husted confirmed in the earnings call that they are in the process of launching a buy now, pay later product with TikTok.
Playing into this is GoTo’s recent high-level hire of David Chen, former CEO of BNPL player Atome, as its head of consumer lending.
“Our goal and our aim is that GoTo Financial ends up as the most preferred partner with both TikTok Shop as well as Tokopedia’s platform,” said Husted.
Additionally, Walujo said there’s an opportunity for GoTo’s consumer lending offering to scale in line with Tokopedia’s growth. Deeper integrations between GoTo’s ecommerce and fintech arms are also in the pipeline.
Despite GoTo’s profitability milestone, however, its stock price dipped 4.2% to 69 rupiah (US$0.0044) at today’s market opening.

Temasek-backed blockchain firm Immutable, Australia-based King River Capital, and Web3 ecosystem enabler Polygon Labs have teamed up to create a new venture fund. Dubbed the Inevitable Games Fund (IGF), it aims to raise US$100 million from professional investors and focuses on the burgeoning Web3 gaming industry.
The launch comes amid a surge in blockchain gaming activity in the second half of 2023, as observed by DappRadar. Meanwhile, crypto-focused media platform Blockworks expects more Web3 game releases in 2024 compared to previous years and projects an over 2x growth in gaming token market cap.
Managed by King River Capital, IGF’s investments span across game studios, Web3 infrastructure, and immersive gaming experiences. The fund aims to tap into the global video game market by combining King River’s investing capabilities with Immutable and Polygon’s Web3 gaming deal flow.
So far, IGF has invested in seven early-stage companies. These include Pixelmon, a Pokémon-style Web3 title; Guild of Guardians, which has seen over a million pre-registrations; and My Pet Hooligan, which combines animated storytelling with gameplay.
Existing backers include Alpha Wave Ventures, a venture firm supported by Alpha Wave Global and the Abu Dhabi Royal Group’s Chimera Capital.
Other notable investors include Merit Circle – known for its presence in Web3 gaming – and several family offices and individuals with expertise in gaming and digital assets.
Founded in 2018, Immutable helps firms build NFT trading services, among other things. It has raised over US$300 million in funding, including a US$200 million round in 2022 from Temasek, Tencent, and Animoca Brands.
According to Messari, a crypto market intelligence firm, Immutable and Polygon combined command roughly a 70% share of the blockchain gaming development market.

B Capital, the global investment firm established by Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin, has secured US$750 million in commitments for its second Opportunities Fund – nearly doubling its predecessor’s tally.
Called the Opportunities Fund II, it invests in later-stage companies in the tech, healthcare, and climate tech sectors, said B Capital. Focusing on North America and Asia, a majority of the fund will be invested in the VC firm’s existing portfolio, which includes Carro, Kopi Kenangan, and VNG.
B Capital said the new fund will also support new ventures that can benefit from the firm’s strategic partnership with the Boston Consulting Group. The collaboration provides B Capital’s portfolio companies with access to BCG consultants and advisors across the globe.
“Our vision is to leverage our technology expertise and that of our strategic partner BCG to take these high-performing companies to the next level,” said Saverin.
Opportunities Fund II made its first investment in June 2023 with a secondary purchase in US contract intelligence firm Icertis, which has been in B Capital’s portfolio since 2017.
Without specifying names, the VC firm said a “diverse global base” of sovereign wealth funds, family offices, and high-net-worth individuals participated in the fundraise.
While economic headwinds have made it hard for startups to capture new capital over the past couple of years, VC firms targeting Southeast Asia and India raised a record amount of over US$13 billion last year, according to Tech in Asia data. This was more than what the VC firms raised in 2021 and 2022 combined.
Last year, B Capital closed a US$2.1 billion growth fund and a US$500 million global healthcare fund. It also hired a new venture partner for its climate team.

Indonesian tech company GoTo Group is gearing up to launch a buy now, pay later product with TikTok, months after the two firms closed the merger of Tokopedia and TikTok Shop.
GoTo is doubling down on financial services to drive top-line growth as it seeks to convince investors of its long-term earnings potential.
The group’s fintech unit recently snagged David Chen, the co-founder and former CEO of BNPL platform Atome. Chen now heads GoTo’s consumer lending and BNPL business.
In an earnings call upon the release of GoTo’s fourth-quarter 2023 results on March 19, GoTo Financial head Thomas Husted said BNPL has shown promising growth prospects.
“Our goal and our aim is that GoTo Financial ends up as the most preferred partner with both TikTok Shop as well as Tokopedia’s platform,” said Husted, who also serves as GoTo’s COO.
Other players that also offer BNPL services in Indonesia include Akulaku and Kredivo.
In December 2023, GoTo agreed to cede operational control of Tokopedia in a bid to halt the platform’s rapid loss of market share in Indonesia.
With the merger, TikTok will invest over US$1.5 billion in a joint venture that it will control, without additional dilution to GoTo. In exchange, GoTo is expected to gain a steady revenue stream.
Husted said in the earnings call that GoTo is focused on product integrations with TikTok Shop, though the priority lies in ensuring compliance with the regulations set out by Indonesia’s Ministry of Trade.

Financial services, though a slice of GoTo’s overall revenue, is expected to be a significant driver of the group’s growth. In Q4 2023, gross revenue from the firm’s financial technology business rose 25.8% year on year to 605 billion rupiah (US$39 million).
The loan book of GoTo’s consumer lending business, comprising its BNPL and cash-loan offerings, grew by 32% quarter on quarter to 1.9 trillion rupiah (US$120.9 billion).
Payments app GoPay has also been attracting “a large number of users that are coming in unsolicited” to apply for cash loans, said Husted in the earnings call.
“That’s something we are going to work on quite intensively over the next few months,” he added.
GoTo Financial is also working with BFI Finance on providing vehicle financing to drivers. The pilot project is being done on a non-exclusive basis and is subject to regulatory approval.

841052,2024-03-20T01:00:06,2024-04-16T07:33:11,Vietnam’s QR code revolution puts pressure on digital wallets,vietnams-qr-code-revolution-puts-pressure-on-digital-wallets,publish,post,https://www.techinasia.com/vietnams-qr-code-revolution-puts-pressure-on-digital-wallets,"Tap-to-pay methods have become popular in Vietnam, a surprising turn in a country where cash made up 70% of transactions just a few years ago.
What’s the driving force behind this shift? The unassuming quick response or QR code, which can now be found at eateries, pet food stores, hair salons, and street vendors across Vietnam, among others.
Fintech companies are not the sole drivers of this transformation.

Customers can make direct bank transfers via QR codes to pay for their pho (noodle soup) in Hanoi. / Photo credit: Mai Nguyen Anh for Tech in Asia

In 2021, the National Payment Corporation of Vietnam (NAPAS) introduced VietQR, a standardized QR code system that enables customers to scan and pay across banks’ mobile applications.
Payments via VietQR doubled in volume in the third quarter of 2023, reaching 100 million transactions per month, according to NAPAS. That’s one transaction for every person in the country, which means people in urban areas use the system multiple times a month on average.
VietQR’s growing ubiquity raises several questions. For one, do consumers still need digital wallets if they can pay instantly through their banks’ mobile apps? If e-wallets are not a necessity, can they become sustainable businesses?
However, others argue that e-wallets and domestic real-time QR payments like VietQR can coexist. While the former builds services on top of the QR code network, the latter focuses solely on enabling fund transfers.
Regardless, Vietnam’s digital payment market, which will be worth an estimated US$160 billion in gross transaction value (GTV) by 2025, has entered a new era of competition.
The “unsexy” QR code
In 2020, Tech in Asia reported that about 30 digital wallets were competing to get consumers in Vietnam to go cashless. At that time, none had become as commonplace as Alipay or WeChat Pay was in China.
Since then, a select few have emerged as dominant players in the market.

With a user base of 31 million, MoMo is one of Vietnam’s most popular e-wallets. / Photo credit: MoMo

A recent report by research firm FiinGroup identified MoMo, ShopeePay, and VNPay as the leading fintech service providers in Vietnam. Another survey conducted in Q2 2023 by Decision Lab, a market research firm based in Ho Chi Minh City, found that MoMo, ZaloPay, and ShopeePay are the most popular digital wallets.
Among these contenders, MoMo and ZaloPay have been aggressively building their respective super apps, tapping major players such as Grab, Gojek, and TikTok Shop as partners. MoMo also announced a partnership with Apple in May 2023, when the global tech giant launched its official online store in Vietnam.

However, digital payments are not the exclusive playground of fintech companies. Vietnamese commercial banks have also been making substantial investments to enhance their digital capabilities.

Besides Vietnam, governments across Southeast Asia are keen to advance domestic real-time QR payments to boost their digital economies. Notable examples include PayNow in Singapore, PromptPay in Thailand, and PayNet in Malaysia.
As real-time QR payments gain more ground, “it’s evident that digital wallets would feel threatened,” says Joshua Chong, lead consultant at fintech consulting firm Kapronasia. “To be fair, payments were not going to be profitable for them from the start.”
But unlike fintech super apps, domestic QR codes have not hogged the headlines. “It’s a less sexy story, so to speak. The value proposition is very simple: It’s basically just a real-time transfer,” Chong adds.
Super app or not, that momentum is hard to ignore. The transaction value of real-time payment systems in Singapore, Thailand, and Malaysia surged by more than 50% between 2020 and 2021, according to a Kapronasia analysis that cited GlobalData published in November 2023.
VietQR was launched later than its peers in neighboring countries. Still, its popularity could make the government’s goal of reducing cash payments to 8% by 2025 much more feasible, according to Oanh Tran, who leads FiinGroup’s market research and consulting division.

Intense competition
In Vietnam, regulatory issues also stand in the way of e-wallets. For one, all of them must be linked to bank accounts and users must verify their identity by uploading a photo of a valid ID card or passport.
For certain customers, such cumbersome processes would only make sense if the discounts offered are attractive enough.
To capture more nonwallet users, both MoMo and ZaloPay released their “universal” QR codes in 2023. This feature enables all customers with VietQR to pay at merchants affiliated with these e-wallets.

ZaloPay says it had 14 million overall active users in 2023. / Photo credit: ZaloPay

Tuong Nguyen, MoMo’s executive vice chairman and CEO, stressed that the e-wallet’s QR code is flexible as users can choose the source of their funds, whether it be from wallets, banks, or pay-later services. This flexibility can also boost merchants’ revenue.
For ZaloPay CEO Chi Le, VietQR’s explosive growth advances the entire market because consumers are transitioning away from cash much faster. She believes that the competition will focus more on delivering value to merchants. “As for users, they aren’t overly concerned about which QR code they’re scanning,” Le tells Tech in Asia.
Both executives note that their “universal” QR codes can enable merchants to verify or confirm QR transactions in real-time. Sellers can tap into other features to manage payment operations. For example, stores can handle refunds directly from their point-of-sale terminals.
ZaloPay, which claims to have about 14 million overall active users in 2023, will roll out a pilot product with The Pizza Company that allows the latter to build loyalty programs for all consumers, including bank customers.
ZaloPay was launched in 2017 by VNG – Vietnam’s first unicorn – and has now branded itself as the national e-wallet. Like WeChat Pay in China, ZaloPay aims to leverage the 75 million users of the Zalo messaging app, although hitting this goal has proven to be challenging.
A previous Tech in Asia analysis of VNG’s prospectus filed in the US last August found that losses from fintech unit Zion, which operates ZaloPay, had a negative impact on overall profitability. As a whole, VNG recorded a loss of about US$30 million and increased its stake in Zion in 2023, suggesting that ZaloPay continues to operate at a loss.
On that note, Le stressed that ZaloPay has “optimized” its promotional spending and shifted the focus to building other financial services like buy now, pay later as well as savings and stock investing.

Competing or complementing?
Generally, most users only choose to use digital wallets if there are valuable discounts or loyalty points available. Most merchants also indicated that they prefer direct bank transfers from customers. Payment via cards and digital wallets incur additional fees for sellers, and transactions are not settled in real time.
Founder and CEO Hai Nam Bui says the software tools of his startup SoBanHang, which primarily helps small retailers (those that employ no more than 20 workers) set up online stores, have been fully integrated with VietQR.
This integration allows small sellers to monitor sales via a mobile app when customers scan and pay using the QR code.
A spokesperson from NAPAS told Tech in Asia that VietQR was designed with the public’s interest in mind, rather than directly competing with services offered by other providers, including digital wallets.
Digital wallets, of course, can still be useful in many ways. Users can pay bills, purchase event tickets, place ecommerce orders, and make petty cash payments. For example, one can buy movie tickets at cheaper prices using MoMo or pay their insurance fees on ZaloPay.
“VietQR and digital wallets serve different purposes and can complement each other,” contends Huy Pham, a senior finance lecturer at RMIT University in Ho Chi Minh City.

He thinks that e-wallets should consider teaming up with more merchants and provide foreign users with direct access to Vietnamese goods and services.
Tran from FiinGroup believes that digital wallet providers can leverage VietQR to encourage more people to go cashless. She noted that some mobile banking apps have not integrated their services into various ecosystems as effectively as e-wallets have.
This might give the likes of MoMo and ZaloPay some leeway for now, but Pham of RMIT University believes that “only a few will survive in the long term” as competition intensifies.","Fueled by the simplicity of a QR code, Vietnamese consumers are embracing cashless payments at an unexpectedly rapid pace.",Thu Huong Le,Editing by Terence Lee and Eileen C.

Philippines-based VC firm Kaya Founders has secured a total of 1 billion pesos (over US$18 million) as of the second close of its two latest funds, bringing its total assets under management to roughly US$22.5 million.
Pavilion Capital and Concentric Equity Partners as well as Gabriel and Geraldine Sunshine of Boston-based hedge fund Bracebridge Capital participated in the round.
Kaya will invest in 30 to 40 early-stage startups in the Philippines and Southeast Asia over the next four years via the new funds, which are called Zero to One and One to Ten.
The firm was also appointed as a co-investment partner for the Startup Venture Fund (SVF), a US$8.9 million investment vehicle aimed at supporting startups in the Philippines.
SVF is overseen by the National Development Company, the investment arm of the Department of Trade and Industry.
“If you look at the amount of venture funding that has gone into the ecosystem – relative to our gross domestic product and population – it’s clear that the Philippines has long been underinvested and
underlooked as a market,” said Paulo Campos, one of Kaya’s founding members.
The 2023 Philippine Startup Ecosystem Report seems to support his observation. As of November 2023, startups secured 40% less than the funds raised during a similar period in 2022. These were spread across just 40 deals at the time, the report found.
Founded in 2021, Kaya invests in pre-seed to series A companies, typically between US$100,000 and US$500,000.
The firm has a portfolio of 44 startups spread across sectors such as ecommerce, logistics, and fintech. Some of its recent investments include the US$17.8 million series A of ecommerce enabler Etaily and the US$11 million series A of logistics startup Locad.

DBS Bank India has pledged US$250 million in lending for the country’s startups.
This initiative is part of its efforts to boost local innovation and entrepreneurship, particularly among startups that are integrating cutting-edge technologies to introduce novel solutions, the bank said in a statement.
DBS Bank India is evaluating a diverse range of startups for the pledge, including those in tech and healthcare as well as startups that use AI to provide services in sectors like finance, retail, and logistics.
The bank’s pledge comes as the funding winter is expected to come to halt starting this year.
Startups in India are expected to raise US$8 billion to US$12 billion, said Rajan Anandan, managing partner of VC firm Peak XV, at the Startup Mahakumbh summit. He added that this amount will be enough for the local ecosystem to thrive.
In comparison, Indian startups raised just a total of US$7 billion in 2023, a drastic drop from US$41.4 billion in 2021.
DBS Bank India’s announcement also builds upon the bank’s Businessclass FoundED forum, which has engaged with over 1,000 startups and 50 incubators across the country. The initiative was launched in April 2022 with the help of VC firm Anthill Ventures and evangelist network Headstart Network Foundation.

After facing continuous losses, GoTo Group made a profit on an adjusted EBITDA basis in the last quarter of its 2023 fiscal year.
In Q4 2023, the company’s adjusted EBITDA improved to 77 billion rupiah (US$4.9 million), recovering from US$197 million in adjusted losses in the same period the year before.
This came on the back of the company’s efforts to cater to broader market segments and “disciplined cost management,” GoTo said in a statement. During the quarter, the company shrank its total cost of revenues to US$83.7 million, with sales and marketing expenses decreasing 42% to US$84.4 million.
The company also announced a US$200 million share buyback program, which could signal the company’s confidence that its share prices will go up, at least in the short term.
GoTo also expects to hit group-level adjusted EBITDA breakeven for the full 2024 financial year.
The groups’s net revenue amounted to US$273 million in Q4, showing a notable 26% increase from the same period the year before.
Most of this amount came from its on-demand services arm Gojek, whose gross revenue rose 4% annually to US$769.7 million. Following it was ecommerce business Tokopedia, which reported US$578.9 million in gross revenue but logged a greater year-on-year leap at 11%.
Both segments also generated adjusted EBITDA profit.
Meanwhile, total group transaction value also went up to US$10.36 billion in Q4, an 8% uptick from the previous quarter.
However, the group booked a net loss of US$5.7 billion for the full year – widening by 124% year over year. Of the amount, US$5.15 billion came in the quarter, primarily driven by roughly a US$5 billion goodwill reversal as required by prevailing accounting standards.
This was brought about by the Tokopedia and TikTok deal that resulted in the loss of control of Tokopedia starting February 1, 2024, GoTo said.
Nevertheless, the group registered a 30% year-on-year growth in overall revenue for the full year at US$940.2 million.

The National University of Singapore (NUS) is setting aside S$20 million (US$14.9 million) for further development and commercialization of deeptech research, Channel News Asia reported.
This investment is said to be a strategic move to scale advanced research into practical applications, with an emphasis on technologies that can address global issues such as climate change and food security.
Half of the funds would be designated for helping NUS faculty members and researchers turn their deeptech projects into marketable products.
The other half of the amount will be used to bolster the university’s Graduate Research Innovation Programme – better known by its acronym NUS Grip. This is an existing program designed to guide and support aspiring entrepreneurs in launching businesses based on deeptech innovations.
The new investment would add to NUS’ previous partnership with Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and Temasek for a roughly US$55 million pilot program for deeptech startups stemming from the two universities’ research.
Additionally, in 2021, Temasek pledged to set aside US$740 million annually for deeptech investments, focusing on areas like advanced manufacturing, disruptive materials, net-zero tech, life sciences, and foodtech.

Hello reader,
Is perception really reality?
It’s a hard philosophical question to answer, but as with all things, if you can look at some good data, you stand a better chance of answering it.
For example, one might have the perception that amid a funding winter and economic headwinds, VCs don’t have much capital available to invest. Our VC funds tracker, however, tells a different story.
The data shows that VCs focused on Southeast Asia and India have plenty of dry powder on hand, so they’re perhaps just being more cautious about where they invest it.
Today we look at:

Premium summary
Follow the funding

We may be in the middle of a funding winter, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t dry powder out there.
In fact, Tech in Asia’s VC funds tracker shows that VCs targeting Southeast Asia and India secured a record amount of over US$13 billion in 2023.


Promising signs: Just a month into 2024, VCs focused on the two regions had already amassed more than US$1 billion. Notably, some VCs that announced the final close of their funds this year launched in 2022 and 2023. An example is Northstar Ventures Fund I, which saw its first close in January 2023 and collected US$140 million in total at the end of the year.

AI on the rise: Only four AI-focused funds were raised when the fund tracker was first published last year, but now the number stands at 12, showing how much interest the sector has drawn recently. However, a significant number of investors we track are notably sector-agnostic.

The whole world’s a stage: Unsurprisingly, most of the VCs we’ve tracked favor investing in early-stage startups. Though funding for late-stage startups is available, relatively few VC funds focus on these deals, with macroeconomic headwinds likely a factor.

News spotlight
A different approach to AI

Image credit: Timmy Loen

The prevailing wisdom in the AI sector is that companies should build their own large language models, but a seasoned Chinese investor says more should go against the grain.
Allen Zhu, managing director for GSR Ventures, told Tencent News in an interview about his distinct investment strategy for AI.


Fundamentals: Zhu said he prefers to focus on startups that are financially viable with low capital investment and whose products quickly fit the market. He sees generating revenue and ensuring market viability as crucial.

Grounded: A lot of the big players in the AI space are pursuing the creation of artificial general intelligence (AGI), which is a type of AI that can match or even surpass humans in a wide variety of areas. Zhu believes that it makes more sense to focus on practical AI applications that can capitalize on China’s unique market and data landscape, as opposed to AGI, which lacks immediate business use.

Weighing in: Zhu also had his say on one of the fundamental debates in AI – proprietary versus open-source AI models. The investor predicted that open-source tech will eventually rival or even outperform their proprietary cousins.

After a fresh delivery of Nvidia chips, India-based Yotta Data Services is set to strengthen its presence with the country’s largest bet yet in the AI industry, Bloomberg reported.
With this, Yotta will be able to provide Nvidia’s class-leading performance to its clients through its data centers. Located across India, these data centers offer adjustable data storage and computing capacity, eliminating the need for businesses and researchers to invest in and install their own hardware.
Sunil Gupta, CEO of Yotta, told Bloomberg that his company has a competitive advantage over cloud computing services located outside the country due to latency concerns troubling the latter. He also expects the firm to grow as a supplier to clients not only in India but across Asia as well.
In January, the company upped its investment into its data centers, announcing that it would purchase AI chips from Nvidia worth US$500 million. This brought its total order book with the US firm to US$1 billion.
Currently, Yotta runs six data centers in four Indian cities, with a new center opening soon in Northeast India.
Nvidia’s AI tech has been a hot commodity, with the company forging partnerships globally to help build local AI infrastructure. This includes a collaboration with a unit of Malaysian conglomerate YTL, which is part of a larger US$4.3 billion deal.

Photo credit: Shopback

Temasek-backed cashback and rewards platform ShopBack has reduced its employee headcount by 24% – cutting out 195 people – “to become more focused and self-sustainable as a company.”
The shock announcement was made by co-founder and chief executive Henry Chan at the company’s town hall on March 19. Those slated to be laid off were notified within an hour of the event’s conclusion.
All departures were enforced for the same day “out of respect and to ease transition for departing team members.” The last in-office day for affected staff is March 19, 2024.
“Undoubtedly, this is one of the hardest decisions I’ve had to make in our company’s history,” wrote Chan in a message posted on the ShopBack website.
Affected employees were offered payment for at least two months following their notice period. They will also be given an additional month’s salary as severance pay for every full year of service – or based on local statutory guidelines, whichever is higher.
Retrenched employees will also receive a bonus equivalent to one month’s salary, though this amount will be pro-rated for those who have yet to complete a full year of service. Unused leave days will be encashed as well.
All outgoing employees will have their medical insurance coverage extended, and access to mental healthcare support will run until June 30, 2024. Employees will receive career transition support, too, which includes either curriculum vitae reviews or a “career transition support allowance” determined in consultation with the company’s human resources department.
For visa holders, the company will cover costs for repatriation, which include airfare and a budget for moving expenses.
In his note, Chan disclosed that ShopBack approached its headcount reductions by “redesigning from scratch a reorganized and lean organizational structure” that would enable it to deliver on its strategy for sustainable growth.
Every existing role within the organization was reviewed to determine if they aligned with ShopBack’s future needs, he said.
“Ultimately, I decided on a more substantial reduction to minimize the chances of us ever having to do this again.”
ShopBack’s layoffs come a month after the company reported a 20% decline in its revenue to US$87.7 million for the financial year ended March 2023. Voucher revenue fell by more than half.
The company’s losses before tax also widened by 29% year on year, as one-off employee and mergers and acquisitions expenses affected growth.
Earlier this month, the company announced it would be discontinuing its “buy now, pay later” service starting March 22 following a periodic review of its business units.

Hi there,
I love playing strategy games. One of my all-time favorites is still the Age of Empires franchise, which I could play all day long when I was a teenager.
Many of my friends found these games boring and not as stimulating as role-playing games – they do require a certain level of patience and planning to win.
My strategy was to have the best army when facing the enemy, so I spent a lot of time just upgrading my forces.
Likewise, startup founders need to have a strategy to scale their businesses and carry out their expansion plans.
In our first Big Story, my colleague Lokesh wrote about Indian ride-hailing firm Ola’s unique strategy, with expansions into the electric vehicle and AI segments. That’s unlike other players – such as Uber, Grab, or GoTo – that have expanded into food delivery and fintech.
In the story, we outline an often-used pattern by Ola co-founder Bhavish Aggarwal, which involves raising funds, making acquisitions, and building on top of these businesses. This strategy was deployed when Ola entered the electric vehicle space and now is being used to expand into the generative AI business with Krutrim AI.
Speaking about founder strategies, in our second Big Story, my colleague Scott explores Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino’s game plan to break the “monopoly” of cloud giants Microsoft, AWS, and Google. Ardoino hopes to do this by reviving a technology that caused a lot of damage to the music industry in the 1990s.
He’s looking to combine P2P networks with Web3 and end-to-end encryption on a new software development platform. Could this combo attract litigation and regulatory attention? Maybe, but Ardoino remains unfazed.
And since founder strategies are shaped by past experiences, I explore in Making Waves how the partners at founder-focused VC firm Febe Ventures use their 30 years of combined experience to guide entrepreneurs through even the toughest of times.

Singtel is launching GPU as a service (GPUaaS) in Singapore and other Southeast Asian countries in the third quarter of 2024.
GPUaaS is a cloud-based solution that offers access to graphics processing units (GPUs) on demand. Potential applications for GPUs include machine learning, graphics rendering, data processing, high-performance computing, and gaming.
Earlier today, the telecommunications provider said its GPUaaS will be deployed through Nvidia H100 GPU-powered clusters that are operated in Singtel’s existing upgraded data centers in Singapore.
Singtel intends to eventually expand its GPUaaS to run in its three upcoming sustainable AI data centers across Singapore, Thailand, and Indonesia when they begin operations.
These are currently being developed by Nexra, the group’s regional data center business. Singtel plans to deploy over 100 megawatts of such data centers through Nxera within the next three years.
The company will be among the world’s first to deploy Nvidia’s GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchips upon receiving them in early 2025. Singtel said this would give its enterprise customers options for different types of accelerators for their advanced computing and AI needs.
Using over 200 billion transistors, the Blackwell GPUs are said to deliver 30x faster real-time large language model inference than their predecessors.
“Our GPUaaS will run in AI-ready data centers specifically tailored for intense compute environments with purpose-built liquid-cooling technologies for maximum efficiency and lowest power usage effectiveness, giving [enterprise customers] the flexibility to deploy AI without having to invest and manage expensive data center infrastructure,” said Bill Chang, CEO of Singtel’s Digital InfraCo unit as well as Nxera.
He added that the group has been seeing “keen interest” from both private and public sectors, which are “raring to deploy AI at scale quickly and cost-effectively.”
Separately, on the same day, Singtel announced that it launched a digital aggregation and orchestration platform, Paragon-S, at the global Satellite 2024 Conference and Exhibition in Washington DC.
Paragon-S was developed in-house and is based on Singtel’s patented orchestration platform Paragon. It integrates multiple orbit satellites with terrestrial fixed and mobile network connectivity services.
It enables enterprises to switch applications between satellite operators’ edge cloud and public clouds based on their business requirements.
Singtel said this marks the satellite industry’s first all-in-one orchestration platform, which it believes will help satellite operators enhance resiliency and optimize cost, while also unlocking new streams of revenue through edge computing and AI.
“The introduction of Paragon-S will empower satellite operators to become platform companies for enterprises. We will build on our existing ecosystem with partners to help operators develop and accelerate time to market for their use cases,” commented Chang.
Shares of Singtel were up S$0.02 (US$0.015) or 0.8% at S$2.51 (US$1.87) as of 11.53 a.m. today after both announcements.

Singapore-based Tokenize Xchange has secured an additional US$11.5 million in its series A round from VC firm Trive and high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs).
This boosted its series A funding to US$23 million. The digital asset exchange intends to raise a total of US$33 million by the end of 2024.
The new funds will go towards team growth as Tokenize eyes a 5x increase in its Singapore headcount in the next 18 months. The company plans to hire a significant number of specialists in compliance and operations.
This is part of Tokenize’s efforts to adhere to the complex regulations of digital assets in Southeast Asia, CEO Hong Qi Yu said in a statement.
Compared to other countries in the region, Singapore already has a fairly robust regulatory framework for digital assets. The city-state has rules in place that cover crypto exchanges, stablecoins, and, to some extent, NFTs.
Tokenize is also working to secure a digital payment token license in Singapore, where it is currently operating under an exemption.
In Malaysia, Tokenize was among the first three digital exchange operators to receive full approval from the country’s Securities Commission in April 2020.
Founded in 2017, Tokenize currently allows the trading of over 80 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other popular tokens. It is also one of the few exchanges in Singapore that allows users to buy cryptocurrencies in Singapore dollars.
Besides Singapore and Malaysia, Tokenize also has a presence in Vietnam.

Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao has unveiled a new project called Giggle Academy.
The platform – which Zhao has launched in the middle of battling legal cases in the US – provides education for grades one to 12 learners, according to its concept paper. It is also a zero-revenue platform that uses AI and automation and is fully online.
Giggle Academy involves an “adaptive individualized curriculum” tackling subjects like math, science, physics, biology, and finance. All courses will be free to take.
That said, the platform doesn’t aim to replace existing education systems. Instead, it wants to provide underprivileged kids in developing countries access to learning.
The education platform will also incorporate Web3 concepts, with badges in the form of NFTs, points, scores, and rankings, among others.
“Building a high-quality and sticky education platform that is entirely free and accessible to all is the most impactful thing I could do for the next chapter of my life,” Zhao wrote on the Giggle Academy website.
In November 2023, the founder pleaded guilty to anti-money laundering charges tied to Binance. He agreed to step down as CEO of the crypto exchange as part of a US$4.3 billion settlement with the US Department of Justice.
The criminal trial for Zhao has been postponed to April 30.

Set on May 30 at GEM Center in Ho Chi Minh City, our event aims to bring together the region’s brightest minds and leading innovators to make connections and create opportunities to push the growth of Vietnam’s tech sector.
Why Vietnam?
The theme for Saigon Summit is “Charting Vietnam’s Tech Future.” That seems apt, given that the country a booming market in Southeast Asia.
Vietnam is also considered by some as the region’s third major startup market, right after Singapore and Indonesia. Not only is it home to notable tech companies such as VNG, VNLife, and Sky Mavis, it also has a relatively young, tech-savvy population.
Tech in Asia can contribute to this emerging tech scene by linking it to our community and tapping into our events expertise.

For example, we hosted a Regional Founders Meetup in Vietnam last year. Not that such activities are new to the country, but as our events lead, Eng Zhiting, previously observed, the networks at these sessions “can be limited.” That’s why people end up “seeing the same faces every time,” she added.
This is where Tech in Asia’s network comes in. “We were able to bring new people, and that made for a great dynamic and fresh conversations,” Eng noted.
We want to develop these connections further and at an even larger scale. Through the Saigon Summit, we’ll be gathering founders, investors, business leaders, and other movers and shakers to unpack Vietnam’s tech opportunity.
What to expect
Participants can expect a host of exciting keynotes, panel discussions, and fireside chats at the event. We’ll discuss everything from building businesses in Vietnam to expanding into the country.
You’ll hear from speakers including: 

Le Hong Minh, founder and CEO, VNG 
Niraan de Silva, CEO, VNLife
Hai Linh Tran, CEO, Sendo
Christopher Madiam, co-founder and CEO, Social Bella
Binh Tran, co-founder and partner, AVV
Justin Nguyen, partner, Monk’s Hill Ventures 
Nguyen Nguyen, co-founder and CEO, Selex Motors
Son Nguyen, CEO, Dat Bike
Peter Bithos, CEO, Seek Asia
Tuyet Vu, advisor, Vertex Ventures
Zhizhong Neo, co-founder and CEO, Geniebook 

Aside from our stage sessions, attendees can look forward to other key segments such as:

Startup Showcase

The trade show segment of Saigon Summit will feature 40 rising startups from Vietnam and Southeast Asia. Startup Showcase will train the spotlight on their purpose and innovations, drawing in potential investors, customers, and partners.


Investor Hour

The right connections can really move the needle. Investor Hour offers a series of curated, purpose-driven conversations to match startups and investors.


Satellite Events

Go beyond the summit to form connections and gain even deeper insights into Vietnam’s growth through a series of satellite events designed to cultivate learning and networks.



We look forward to eye-opening insights, in-depth conversations, meaningful networking, and fresh ideas for Vietnam’s tech growth. Secure your seat at Saigon Summit by getting your ticket today.

Yan Xiaolei is the new CEO of Freshippo, the grocery arm of Alibaba Group, replacing its founder Hou Yi, a source familiar with the matter told Bloomberg.
Hou will be transitioning to a senior advisor role at the company, the source added. Yan was previously Freshippo’s CFO.
The development comes after Freshippo shelved a Hong Kong IPO due to poor market sentiment.
Launched in 2016, Freshippo currently runs over 360 stores in China. It aims to open 70 additional outlets this year, according to the report.
Alibaba recently reported a 5% year-on-year increase in overall revenue for the third quarter of its 2024 financial year, hitting US$36.7 billion.
In its most recent financial results announcement, Alibaba group CEO Eddie Wu said the company’s top priority is to “reignite the growth of our core businesses, ecommerce, and cloud computing.”
Seemingly part of this effort is Alibaba promoting younger executives to head divisions like cloud computing and core domestic commerce.
The group has seen an uptick in regulatory scrutiny over the past few years, which played into a 75% drop in shares from the company’s peak. This has led to increased competition from companies like PDD Holdings and ByteDance as well, the report noted.

841051,2024-03-19T01:55:44,2024-05-20T09:29:26,‘India’s Elon Musk’ is on a warpath,olas-playbook-rides-on-acquisitions-to-expand-beyond-ride-hailing,publish,post,https://www.techinasia.com/olas-playbook-rides-on-acquisitions-to-expand-beyond-ride-hailing,"Shortly after Uber entered India in 2013, the ride-hailing giant was facing constant setbacks. In 2015, it received around 400,000 fraudulent bookings from 90,000 fictitious accounts.
Uber alleged that the company behind these bookings was none other than Ola, one of its rivals in the country.
Founded in 2010 by Bhavish Aggarwal and Ankit Bhati, Ola was trying to take on Uber at its own game, similar to what Didi Chuxing did in China.
“The analogy that I give in India is that this is like [the] Vietnam war. We are the local guerrillas. We have the Americans carpet bombing us,” said Aggarwal at an event back in 2017, referring to Ola’s competition with Uber.
Today, Ola’s expansion journey is unlike other ride-hailing firms globally, moving into diverse sectors such as electric vehicles and generative AI. In contrast, other ride-hailing firms like Grab, GoTo, and Uber have extended their businesses into related industries such as food delivery, ecommerce, and financial services.
Despite Aggarwal stepping into completely different sectors, he has managed to achieve a level of success in some of them.

Recently, Ola said its mobility business hit operating profitability with an EBITDA of 2.5 billion rupees (US$30 million) for the financial year ended March 2023.
Ola Electric is also the top-selling electric two-wheeler brand in the country, with a 33% market share in 2023 despite instances of its bikes catching fire.
This is akin to Elon Musk’s ability to acquire and build successful businesses in completely different industries from EVs to social media.
Aggarwal even draws a direct comparison with Musk’s Tesla by saying, “Tesla is for the West, Ola [is] for the rest.”
So how does this Indian Musk build such large businesses in unrelated sectors?
Ola didn’t respond to Tech in Asia’s queries for this article.
Building on acquisitions
The answer lies in Aggarwal’s acquisition and scaling strategy. Ola has acquired 11 companies in the last eight years.

It began in 2015 when Ola shifted gears by acquiring TaxiForSure, a local ride-hailing rival, for US$200 million. This came six months after a US$210 million funding round led by SoftBank.
This established a playbook that would define Ola’s current business strategy: raise funds, acquire, and expand.
While the TaxiForSure deal helped strengthen Ola’s position in the India’s ride-hailing space, other acquisitions were used to give it a foothold into new verticals.
Ola Electric’s base came from acquiring Etergo in May 2020, an Amsterdam-based electric scooter startup. At the time, Etergo was known as the “Tesla of the scooter world.”
The Etergo acquisition happened after Ola closed a US$250 million series B round from Softbank in July 2019.
In August 2021, the company launched its first electric scooter, the Ola S1. It was a slightly modified version of Etergo’s AppScooter, with all the design elements, disc brakes, rear suspension, and tire sizes remaining the same.

One factor where the Ola S1 and the AppScooter differed was battery configuration. Etergo provided swappable batteries while Ola opted for a fixed-battery solution, which also made its bike heavier.
Elsewhere, Aggarwal made headlines with Ola floating an AI company in June 2023. Seven months later, it rolled out the beta version of its large language model Krutrim AI.
The quick launch came as Ola quietly acquired AI firm Bodhi Computing in the second half of 2023, sources tell Tech in Asia.
Before the said acquisition, Krutrim AI raised US$23 million in debt from Matrix Partners in October 2023.
When Tech in Asia reached out to Sambit Sahu, co-founder and director of Bodhi Computing, he directed us to speak to an Ola spokesperson.

Sambit Sahu asking people to join Krutrim AI

Ola didn’t respond to our request for confirmation of the deal.
Acquisition strategy aside, Aggarwal also steps into industries in which there is high investor activity.
Case in point is Ola throwing its hat into the generative AI space when investor interest is at its peak. Just after two months of its official launch, he brought in US$50 million in funding for Krutrim AI, which made it India’s first AI unicorn.

For Ola Electric, Aggarwal raised over US$1 billion in funding from top VC firms such as Matrix Partners, Tiger Global, and SoftBank.
The EV maker is now gearing up for a US$1 billion IPO, which could take its valuation to US$7 billion.
Aggarwal has also recruited top talent to head these business units. For Ola Electric, he appointed Wayne Burgess, who previously worked for Aston Martin and Jaguar, as head of vehicle design. The company also set up research facilities in the US and the UK for its recruitment efforts.
Likewise, Krutrim AI onboarded Biswajit Patra, Intel’s former senior principal engineer, as its product architect. The firm also hired senior industry experts Gautam Bhargava and Sheetal Chittawar.
That said, hiring the best talent and acquisition doesn’t ensure success. The beta version of Krutrim AI showed a high level of hallucinations and had other issues with the quality of its replies.
A bumpy ride
Many ride-hailing firms have found success by adding food and grocery delivery offerings to their platforms. Yet, Ola has struggled to integrate these services into its platform multiple times, and even acquisitions haven’t ensured its foothold in the space.

Besides this, Pranav Bhavsar, co-founder and consumer analyst of India Independent Insight, tells Tech in Asia that the country’s ride-hailing market has become saturated.
He says that ride-hailing in India is currently dominated by Ola and Uber. However, operational costs limit them from offering large discounts to customers or incentives to drivers to effect significant changes to their market share.
Perhaps this is why Ola shifted focus to its EV unit in mid-2022. Apart from aggressive hiring efforts, the company laid off nearly 1,000 employees in its mobility arm.
That said, Ola Electric’s journey wasn’t a smooth ride. Soon after it delivered its first batch of EV scooters, there were several cases of the bikes catching fire. This led to the firm recalling 1,400 vehicles.
Despite this, Ola Electric is now the top-selling EV bike brand in India. This is an impressive feat as a local car manufacturer Tata Motors faced the same issue during its launch of the Tata Nano car over 10 years ago, which eventually brought the vehicle’s journey to an end.

Ola scooters still continued to catch fire, but that didn’t slow down its sales.
That said, Ola Electric sold a number of its scooters to its parent firm in January this year. The company has denied that this was done to boost its sales, saying that it was part of Ola’s plans to launch an EV taxi service.
Recently, Ola Electric has also been seeing the strains of its success as it struggles to address several after-sales issues.
Hustle culture hurts
Since day 1, Aggarwal has been the poster boy of hustle culture in India.
He is inspired by the likes of Musk, making statements such as “our generation is destined to toil” and weekends being a Western import from the Industrial Revolution.
However, this hustle culture has sparked an attrition problem for Ola Electric.
The company’s attrition rate scaled to a high of 47.5% in the 2022-23 fiscal year, as per a report by The Morning Context. The level of exits was high especially at the top management, reportedly due to a culture that emphasizes speed and crunched timelines.
Half of the current leaders at Ola Electric joined the company less than 12 months ago. Notably, two senior executives at the EV firm stepped down in August 2023.
The strategy that might have suited Aggarwal while building a tech company may not be the best approach for building an automotive manufacturer. However, the founder didn’t deny these allegations and defended his “aggressive” style of working.
“We are a very hardworking company… we’re not here to have a nice easy time and make money, obviously, all those things will happen. But we are here to follow our dreams and follow our mission,” he said in an interview with Mint.

Grab has partnered with crypto payments provider Triple-A to let GrabPay users in Singapore top up their e-wallets via digital tokens.
With this new feature, stablecoins and other digital assets can be converted into usable funds for GrabPay, the Singapore-based company said in a statement to Tech in Asia.
The GrabPay app supports top-ups through coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDC, and USDT. It also accepts XSGD, a blockchain-powered stablecoin linked to the Singapore dollar.
XSGD is offered by Fazz, the company formed after the merger of Indonesia-based Payfazz and Singapore-based Xfers. Fazz also operates StraitsX, a digital assets platform that recently received in-principle approval for its major payment institution license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore.
The move allowed Xfers to issue XSGD and US dollar-denominated XUSD in compliance with MAS’ upcoming stablecoin regulatory framework.
While top-ups via crypto are only available in Singapore for now, Grab will “continue to monitor user adoption and respond to demand for such services.”
The announcement builds upon the super app’s previous collaboration with Triple-A. In 2021, Grab’s partnership with Triple-A saw GrabPay wallet being added as one of the payment options to top up the latter’s trading platform wallet.
Such initiatives indicate the company’s efforts to move crypto into the mainstream. In September 2023, Grab introduced a Web3 feature that gave users NFT vouchers for popular restaurants and services during the F1 Grand Prix, which was held in Singapore last year.

Pham Nhat Vuong, founder of Vietnamese electric vehicle maker VinFast, has launched a new venture that would focus on developing and deploying an EV charging station ecosystem that “prioritizes supporting VinFast vehicles.”
Called V-Green, the new company will invest nearly US$404 million over the next two years to build new stations, upgrade and complete VinFast’s existing charging infrastructure, and oversee the stations’ operations and management.
Vuong, who is also the Vietnamese billionaire behind local conglomerate Vingroup, holds a 90% stake in V-Green – which is spun off from VinFast’s charging station development division.
The decision “reduces VinFast’s infrastructure investment needs and provides maximum support for the EV manufacturer’s rapid development,” said Nguyen Duc Thanh, CEO of V-Green, in a statement.
If successful, V-Green could mimic the success of Tesla’s Supercharger. This extensive charging network has proved to be a major boon for the Elon Musk-led EV firm, setting it apart from its competition.
V-Green said it will search for land and partners to set up and expand its charging network in VinFast’s key markets, such as the US, Canada, and Europe. It also intends to secure funding at lower costs, which can then be utilized to fuel VinFast’s expansion into international markets.
VinFast has ambitions to enter at least 50 countries in 2024. Aside from Vietnam, it’s building EV manufacturing plants in the US and India.

B2B ecommerce startups in India and Southeast Asia have been facing challenges in scaling up their businesses after the pandemic.
In December 2023, Indian unicorn Udaan laid off at least 100 employees after raising US$340 million, while two months earlier, Indonesia-based Ula announced that it was also cutting jobs and transitioning out of its inventory-led FMCG distribution business.
However, positive news comes from B2B startup Jumbotail, which has raised US$18.2 million in an equity round. Artal Asia, Heron Rock, Sabre Investment, Arkam Ventures, and others participated in the round.
Founded in 2015 by Karthik Venkateswaran and Ashish Jhina, the Jumbotail marketplace connects supermarkets and mom-and-pop grocery retailers with brands and staples producers.
With this funding round, the India-based company has raised a total of US$143 million. The fresh capital will be used for scaling Jumbotail’s suite of go-to-market products and services for new and emerging brands to reach consumers.
“We expect to be fully profitable on an operational basis across our entire network before the end of 2024,” said Jhina, who also serves as COO of Jumbotail.

Hello reader,
I watched Dune: Part Two last week and it was absolutely incredible. In some respects, it feels a lot like this generation’s Lord of the Rings – books with an intense and dense story as well as amazing world building adapted into perfectly executed films.
If you’ve watched either or both of the Dune films, I highly recommend watching this video as well, in which the director Denis Villenueve explains how he shot the famous Gob Jabbar scene.
It shows how well he understands the source material and how his creativity is such a boon in turning strange, foreign concepts into visually entertaining scenes on screen.
The character of Paul Atreides is amazing and I especially love how he’s written in the books. Right now, I’m about partway through the third book, and one of the most fascinating plotlines is his extreme character growth.
He goes from a young, unprepared boy into a messianic figure, before settling into the role of an emperor who’s extremely powerful but is slowly resigning himself to an inevitable outcome.
We don’t often see characters evolve on this level, but when authors or writers can pull it off well, it’s always cool to see how someone can change so much over the course of a series.
Back in the business world, Zalora seems to be undergoing a similar degree of change. No longer just a marketplace, the firm is now looking to walk down another path as an ecommerce enabler for Southeast Asia and, perhaps, beyond.
Today we look at:

A golden path

With players like Shopee and Lazada already duking it out in Southeast Asia, I’ve always wondered how Zalora has been able to stay in the ring all these years. Turns out, its strategy to be an ecommerce enabler instead of solely competing in the marketplace arena has been a pretty nifty one. Let’s see how it’s playing out.


The goods must flow: The company’s three fulfillment centers across Southeast Asia can hold inventory for brands no matter the digital channel they’re using – even competitors like Shopee and Lazada. Aside from warehousing and last-mile delivery, Zalora also offers brands services like data and marketing support.  

May thy knife chip and shatter: Given that Zalora goes head to head with other marketplaces, one of the biggest questions about its viability as an ecommerce enabler is whether it can support brands equally on all trade channels that they want to be on, including competitors’ platforms. 

Ascension: Already, gross merchandise value of third-party brands using Zalora’s warehousing and fulfillment solution has grown 300% between 2022 and 2023. With demand for livestreaming solutions growing, Zalora is considering renting out its production studios for external shoots and videos. The firm is also piloting a fulfillment service for brands’ physical stores.

The great wall of US

In the latest development of the TikTok vs. US saga, the lower house of the US Congress has made a bold move: it passed a bill that would require TikTok’s parent company ByteDance to sell the US assets of the short-video app within six months, or else. Will ByteDance eat the ban?


Not even close: In a rare showing of bipartisanship, the bill was passed by a vote of 352 to 65. That said, it still needs to face a vote in the US Senate. 

Geppetto, Geppetto, wherefore art thou: US lawmakers are concerned about the influence of the Chinese government on TikTok, especially since it has 170 million users in the US. That said, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew has strongly denied allegations that the app has links to the Communist Party of China. 

You shall not pass: Following the latest vote, Chew said in a TikTok video that ByteDance will exercise its legal rights to fight the ban.

ByteDance-owned TikTok has reported US$16 billion in revenue for the US market in 2023 as it faces a potential ban in the country, reported the Financial Times.
Driven by TikTok’s massive growth – particularly in China – ByteDance recorded US$120 billion in revenue in 2023, up 40% from the previous year, noted the report, which cited sources.
The company is poised to surpass Meta’s position as the world’s largest social media company in terms of revenue. The US-headquartered firm reported a 16% increase in its numbers, with proceeds at US$135 billion for 2023.
However, TikTok, which has a solid base of 170 million users in the US, is confronting the possibility of a ban or sale in the country amid escalating tensions between the US and China.
Last week, the lower house of the US Congress passed a bill requiring ByteDance to divest TikTok’s US assets within six months or risk facing a ban.
There have been allegations of the Chinese government’s influence on the social media app, which ByteDance CEO Shou Zi Chew has denied.
TikTok is just one of the Asian tech giants feeling the heat from regulators. Others in the same situation as the short-video app include Shopee, which is facing scrutiny in Indonesia over alleged monopolistic practices.
Another is Paytm: Its affiliate, Paytm Payments Bank, was ordered by the Reserve Bank of India to hit pause on all of its banking services.

A minority investor of digital advertising solutions provider TDCX has filed a complaint with the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), asking the regulators to scrutinize a privatization deal that is underway.
In particular, the shareholder V Mittal has drawn attention to Goldman Sachs’ role in the transaction. Goldman Sachs (Singapore) is serving as financial adviser to the group that is buying out the minority shareholders of TDCX.
See also: TDCX’s CEO aims to delist the BPO firm amidst struggling valuation
Mittal noted in the letter, a copy of which was seen by The Business Times, that Goldman Sachs &amp; Co had acted as an underwriter in TDCX’s IPO.
TDCX raised US$349 million in its October 2021 IPO, selling its shares at US$18 each. The stock hit a peak of US$28.68 that same month but quickly lost momentum. It has not traded above US$10 since March 2023.
In January this year, TDCX founder Laurent Junique proposed to buy out minority shareholders and take the company private at US$6.60 per share.
The offer price has since been raised to US$7.20 per share – a premium to where TDCX was trading before the buyout announcement, but a disappointment to shareholders who had bought into the company’s story just a few years ago.
With the likes of Meta and Airbnb on its client list, TDCX had been touted by brokers as a tech disruption play.
According to Mittal’s letter, Goldman Sachs had a “strong buy” rating on the stock, starting with a price target of US$30.30 in November 2021.
Goldman Sachs Asset Management also held a 9.4% stake in TDCX as of February 8, 2024.
Mittal told The Business Times that his intent is not to stop the privatization but to get the regulators to scrutinize the parties in such transactions.
This is not Mittal’s first activist move. After Junique’s proposal was announced, Mittal had written to TDCX’s board and to a special committee convened by the board to consider the privatization offer.
In his letters, Mittal proposed share buybacks to boost the stock. He also asked that the special committee provide stockholders with access to its report or take input from minority shareholders.
TDCX has responded to queries about the privatization process, saying the company has adhered to all relevant legal requirements from the SEC and the Cayman Islands, where it is incorporated. The special committee comprising independent and disinterested directors was formed to consider the previous non-binding proposal dated January 2 from Junique.
“All minority shareholders had a communication channel with the special committee throughout the evaluation process. The special committee has received and considered views of minority shareholders and, where relevant, concerns were deliberated as part of the evaluation process,” said TDCX.
It added that information on the company and merger was released in a timely matter via the Schedule 13E-3 transaction statement in an SEC filing on March 1, as well as on the investor relations site.
The Business Times has reached out to Goldman Sachs for comment.
Shares of TDCX closed at US$7.16 in the US on March 15.

Philippe Auberger, country CEO of Lazada Logistics Indonesia, has resigned from his role at the company, he confirmed with Tech in Asia Indonesia.
“I have finished to build Lazada Logistics and let a young and talented team leading the business to its next phase,” he said in a statement.
Lazada declined to comment on Auberger’s departure.
Prior to becoming country CEO of Lazada Logistics Indonesia in 2020, he was the country manager of Lazada Express. A serial entrepreneur, he co-founded several ventures in the logistics, furniture, and hospitality segments before joining Lazada in 2015.
In January this year, Lazada laid off nearly 30% of its workforce. This came on the back of a series of departures in its Singapore office, including that of Lazada Singapore CEO Loh Wee-Lee in August 2023.
The company faces stiff competition from Shopee in Southeast Asia, with the Sea Group unit looking to increase its investments in livestreaming. In Indonesia, it will encounter intensified competition from Tokopedia following its recent merger with TikTok Shop.

With the world opening up again, we were able to bring our community together through a series of offline events, such as our annual Tech in Asia Conference, our SYNC summit, and the newest addition to our slate: the Regional Founders Meetups. These were networking events that gave founders and tech leaders in our audience the opportunity to connect and exchange ideas.

As we get into the thick of 2024, let’s take a look at how the Regional Founders Meetup series has grown.
Why Founders Meetup?
We started the Regional Founders Meetups because we realized that people crave face-to-face meetings and connections, especially after so much time apart due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
As we did more offline events, we found that the energy and enthusiasm was just so much more palpable when we’re all in the same room together. Video conferencing is great, but it doesn’t really offer that same kind of interaction. Many of our attendees also shared that they valued these in-person connections and were hungry for more opportunities to network with others in the tech scene.

At the time, 2023 was shaping up to be a rough year for startups, with a tech winter setting in, funding slowing down, and economic uncertainty making things tough for everyone.
In the face of this, we wanted founders to feel like they’re not alone, as well as give them an avenue to connect with like-minded folks to ask questions, get help, meet new people, and seize opportunities. After all, who knows the struggles of the founder’s life better than those in the same boat?
And with that, our Regional Founders Meetup series was born.
Highlights of the year
In 2023, we hosted 11 meetups in seven cities – Singapore, Jakarta, Ho Chi Minh, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, Bangkok, and Bangalore – with over 1,000 people in attendance across all the events. That’s 11 evenings of community and networking, and we hope our attendees walked away from the meetups with fresh insights and new connections.
Aside from the networking, some of our meetups included fireside chats, geared at giving founders new ideas and perspectives or addressing some questions they have about the entrepreneurial life.

Some of the speakers we had at our sessions included Brian Cu, co-founder of SariSuki and Grab Philippines, Rexy Josh Dorado, co-founder of Kumu, and Bryan Pelz, co-founder of VNG and Bootloader Studio. We also had our CEO Willis Wee and COO Maria Li talk about Tech in Asia’s own acquisition journey, coming off the back of our acquisition by SPH Media.
Coming up next
We had an amazing 2023, and 2024 is set to be just as exciting, with our Regional Founders Meetups coming back bigger and better than before.
Our first Regional Founders Meetup for the year will be happening in Singapore on April 24.

Rufus Sorsa, associate partner at Antler, and Ed Barker, principal at Square Peg, will be sharing their perspectives on the investment scene and what lies ahead for our tech ecosystem in 2024.

Allen Zhu, a seasoned investor and managing director for GSR Ventures, has adopted a distinct approach to AI in China, distancing himself from the Silicon Valley mindset.
In an interview with Tencent News, Zhu said his investment strategy in the AI space focuses on startups which are financially viable with low capital investment and whose products quickly fit the market. He stressed the importance of generating revenue and ensuring market viability, especially during economic uncertainty.
This is in contrast to a trend of more and more companies looking to make their own large language models (LLMs), a strategy that Zhu was skeptical about in terms of revenue generation.
Now his focus is on practical AI applications that can capitalize on China’s unique market and data landscape, rather than pursuing the elusive goal of artificial general intelligence (AGI) without immediate business use.
AGI is a type of AI that can match or even surpass humans in a wide variety of areas, as compared to narrow AI – which focuses on a specific tasks. The former is what OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is looking to achieve with its research and development efforts.
Highlighting the effectiveness of his no-LLM strategy, Zhu pointed to FancyTech, a company that he said has thrived by producing AI-generated video ads for China’s video-centric consumer base.
Zhu also weighed in on the debate over open-source versus proprietary AI models. He predicted that open-source models, which allow for broader access to AI tech, will eventually rival or even outperform proprietary models.
Seemingly at opposite ends of debate are OpenAI and Grok, Elon Musk’s AI firm. Musk recently said that Grok is planning to make its tech open-source, meaning anyone can access the Grok’s code and even contribute to its development.
Musk also recently took legal action against OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman, who co-founded the company alongside Musk. The Tesla CEO alleged that OpenAI has favored profit maximization instead of keeping its open-source ethos.

The House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted in favor of a bill that would force owner ByteDance to sell the US assets of the short-video app or face a ban in the country.
If passed by the senate – where it appears the bill may be held up for some time – and signed into law by President Joe Biden, the Chinese firm would have six months to comply.

US lawmakers are concerned about the Chinese government’s influence over TikTok and its 170 million users in the US. But what about the impact of this potential ban on ByteDance?
“This process was secret, and the bill was jammed through for one reason: it’s a ban. We are hopeful that the Senate will consider the facts, listen to their constituents, and realize the impact on the economy, 7 million small businesses, and the 170 million Americans who use our service,” said a TikTok spokesperson in response to the passage of the bill.
The company has fought the ban tooth and nail, with TikTok even sending a push notification urging its users in the US to call lawmakers and protest ahead of the vote. But could a potential sale have some upside for the company and its long-awaited IPO?
Tech in Asia spoke to investment analysts and US-China experts for their takes on the bill and the future impact on ByteDance. Their replies were edited for clarity and length.
Possible upsides financially

Photo credit: Ka-ming Lim

Ka-ming Lim is the CEO and co-founder of Singapore fintech firm MoneyFitt. He has experience in the investment industry in London, New York, and Singapore as a stockbroker, fund manager, and trader.
On the assumption that the bill passes both the free speech First Amendment champions in the senate and the US federal courts (which blocked Montana’s state ban last December), and that Beijing, which vehemently opposes a forced sale, doesn’t stand in the way, there could be a positive spin for ByteDance and its shareholders.
It would be fairly simple for ByteDance to distribute TikTok shares in specie to existing ByteDance shareholders, of which 60% are what the company terms “global institutional investors” anyway, and then issue new shares to the public in an IPO in the US. This could assuage any concerns of Chinese ownership.
That’s where the upside both financially and in terms of saving face could kick in.
ByteDance logged quarterly revenues of US$30.9 billion in the third quarter of 2023, the latest for which we have details. Meta was only just higher in the same period, with revenues of US$34.1 billion.
Yet, the market capitalization of Meta (after blowout fourth quarter revenues of US$40 billion) is currently near US$1.3 trillion, more than 4x ByteDance’s recent internal valuation of US$268 billion.
Admittedly, relatively little of ByteDance’s revenues currently come from TikTok. But that’s the growth story that IPO investors could look forward to, even excluding the reentry into the Indian market that the newly divested TikTok could potentially make.
If priced right, the valuation of combined holdings in ByteDance (private) and TikTok (public) could end up much greater than the private valuation alone for existing ByteDance shareholders.
IPO ambitions blunted?

Alvin Chow is the CEO of Dr Wealth. He has more than 15 years of investment experience and is the author of the Finbite Insights newsletter.
The potential sale or ban of TikTok in the US could indeed hinder ByteDance’s IPO ambitions. This stems from TikTok’s status as a global phenomenon, enabling ByteDance to compete internationally beyond China’s borders.
Without TikTok, ByteDance would have to rely solely on Douyin, its platform exclusive to China. Given the recent slump in investments in China, compounded by periodic regulatory changes, investors are increasingly cautious about placing their money in the region.
A business focused solely on China could significantly reduce ByteDance’s valuation, undermining the purpose of an IPO. For context, Kuaishou, a platform comparable to Douyin in China, trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 2x, whereas Meta trades at 9x.
TikTok represents a significant opportunity, not just in the US but also as it captures market share in Southeast Asia, where TikTok Shop has shown promising results. The platform’s foray into ecommerce, alongside traditional advertising revenue streams, highlights its vast growth potential.
Developing a successful social media platform in a world dominated by Meta is challenging enough, but ByteDance’s success with TikTok, originating from China — a first of its kind — is even more remarkable. ByteDance is unlikely to forfeit its prized asset and proceed with a listing without the short-video app.
”Weaponization of Chinese companies”

Photo credit: Sisi Song

Sisi Song previously worked in investing at JP Morgan, Alibaba, and Bessemer Venture Partners. At Bessemer, she launched the firm’s China practice in 2020.
TikTok has been a political football since its launch in the US. Four years ago, Oracle almost bought TikTok’s US business following an order from then-President Donald Trump.
The outcome of a TikTok ban or sale remains uncertain, but the prevailing weaponization of global Chinese companies, from TikTok to Shein, is equally important.
US national security legislation is intentionally vague. This essentially gives regulators free rein to weaponize transactions and make decisions case by case, without establishing standards of how foreign companies can operate in the US.
TikTok has made exhaustive efforts to distance itself from China, including moving its headquarters to Singapore, storing data locally, removing Chinese capital from its cap table, and hiring non-Chinese key personnel.
In addition, more companies in the US and China have emulated TikTok’s approach by establishing their headquarters in places like Singapore and Ireland to neutralize the company’s nationality and sidestep the geopolitical tensions that can scare away global investors.
However, this doesn’t solve the problem, not when the government determines the scope of the businesses to be regulated. The US could easily say that a “PRC-controlled business” includes one that derives most of its revenue from, has a majority of its team in, or has some “special” ties to China, regardless of where its headquarters or data is.
The secondary order effect of weaponization is that everyone in the ecosystem puts discounts on TikTok to account for regulatory uncertainty. In TikTok’s situation, advertisers and creators will need to start diversifying their spending and followers across different platforms in case TikTok is shut down.
ByteDance generated more than US$110 billion in sales in 2023, but its secondary shares are trading at single-digit profit multiples, as investors translate uncertainties into a valuation discount. Regardless of whether the ban is implemented, TikTok is already experiencing the impact.","ByteDance has fought hard against a TikTok ban in the US, but selling the unit off could be a plus for the Chinese firm’s listing ambitions.",Peter Cowan,Editing by Jaclyn Tiu,open,0,"",https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1710731951_Featured-image-TikTok-ban.png,false,"",false,true,true,true,false,5,,1110,US TikTok ban looms: What’s next for ByteDance?,"ByteDance has fought hard against a TikTok ban in the US, but selling the unit off could be a plus for the Chinese firm’s listing ambitions.",,,"","",""

Hello reader,
Last week, a colleague brought up a story I wrote a couple of years back, and I actually forgot that I had written it.
But the one I won’t forget is a story I did on the tightening regulatory landscape faced by tech giants in Southeast Asia. It was the third piece I had ever written for Tech in Asia.
Shortly after it was published in October 2020 – time really does fly – Ant Group’s IPO was suspended, ushering in an era of crackdowns on big Chinese tech companies by the country’s regulators.
This week’s featured story can be viewed as a sequel to that 2020 piece. It looks at what has happened in the ecosystem since then, with other Asian countries such as India and Indonesia upping the ante.
More importantly, it looks at why this enhanced regulatory scrutiny is happening and what the implications are.
The rise of new technologies like genAI will cause even greater disruptions to society, and lawmakers in the European Union passed new rules to regulate AI just last week.
Fast-moving tech founders may view regulation as a hassle or, worse, an impediment to their plans. However, if they fail to ride the tide, they may find their companies subject to value-destroying penalties.

Hot stocks, earnings reports, restructuring, pressure from activist investors, and more.

1️⃣ Next stop: IPO: Used-car marketplaces Carsome and Carro are both preparing to go public. The former has hired Eric Chan, formerly a senior executive from car distributor Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage (C07, SGX), to serve as its group president and COO.
Meanwhile, Malaysia’s MyTukar has recently rebranded to Carro, naming itself after its parent company. Carro co-founder and CEO Aaron Tan said that the group is “IPO-ready and in a position to list…as soon as it becomes realistically possible.”
Things seem to be looking up for the sector. For example, US-listed Carvana Co (CVNA, NYSE) has seen its shares rise by over 10x over the last year, having recovered from the brink of bankruptcy. However, its shares are still down by 79% from their August 2021 peak.
2️⃣ Game on, Ali: Chinese tech giant Alibaba (BABA, NYSE) is making a US$1.1 billion bet on South Korea over the next three years, building out a logistics network in the country to provide speedy deliveries.
The move will bring it into direct competition with local champion Coupang (CPNG, NYSE), which has proved that it can run a profitable ecommerce platform in South Korea. In 2023, Coupang’s adjusted net income for the year was US$465 million, after adjusting for a non-cash tax benefit.
While Alibaba certainly has the resources to mount a challenge, its record outside of China has been mixed. In Southeast Asia, its subsidiary Lazada squandered an early lead and is now playing catch-up to Sea Group’s (SE, NYSE) Shopee.
The Korean market is fairly concentrated, with the top two players (Coupang and Naver Shopping) having a 65% share. There’s always a chance that Alibaba can be a disruptor, but we’re not holding our breath.
3️⃣ Toppan breaks ground: Toppan Holdings (7911, TYO), the global printing company, doesn’t seem like a business we’d typically cover.
However, it also produces substrates used in the manufacturing of semiconductors, which are all the rage due to the rise of cutting-edge tech like genAI that has fueled huge demand for chips.
Toppan is building a factory in Singapore to produce semiconductor packaging materials. It will begin operations in 2026 and is anticipated to create hundreds of new jobs.
This is its first investment in a plant outside of Japan that can produce these substrates. Chip manufacturer Broadcom (AVGO, NDAQ), which is one of Toppan’s top customers, may provide financial support for future expansions.
With Toppan’s major clients and partners located in Singapore, building the plant in the city-state made sense and shows how powerful network effects can be.

The one you didn’t see coming
We spotlight the story that had everyone talking and social media buzzing during the past week.

You’ve been warned: Indonesia’s Ministry of Communication and Information warned six foreign-owned online travel agents to register with the ministry or risk punitive measures including being blocked.
As of March 14, only Agoda and Airbnb (ABNB, NDAQ) have done so. The other four – Booking.com (BKNG, NDAQ), Expedia (EXPE, NDAQ), Klook, and Trivago – have not.
This move comes as the Indonesian government has tightened its oversight of foreign tech companies operating in the country – the requirement for electronic system providers in the private sector to register was issued in July 2022.
Ultimately, this seems like a small price to pay to access the world’s fourth-biggest population.

Hi readers,
Recently, I noticed a key difference between tech startup ecosystems in the West and the East: the type of investors. VC partners in Asia largely come from investment banking  while those in the US and Europe are mostly founder-led VCs.
Experience does make a difference. While investment bankers will look at the numbers, those with an entrepreneurial background can offer a different solution to a founder’s problems.
The right advice in the toughest of times can make or break a startup, especially in its early days.  This is why startups seek investors with founder experience.
One such VC firm is Febe Ventures, whose name is a shortened form of  “for entrepreneurs, by entrepreneurs.” Collectively, its partners have built over 30 companies and backed over 200 startups.
Olivier Raussin, Febe’s co-founder and managing partner, offered hope to frantic founders who might be facing a gloomy future amid this tech winter. Despite going through a bleak period himself, he steered Brazilian wine startup Evino back to growth.
“After many painful decisions and lessons, my previous company didn’t just survive. It managed to completely turn around and found a path to healthy growth,” says Raussin.
Because of this experience, he feels confident telling founders that a reversal of fortune  is possible. Even hearing such a story can motivate and inspire change in founders.
In the end, a company is as strong as their founders at the early stages.

Hello reader,
Of today’s top deals, one stands out to me. Rukita, which received US$15 million in series B money, offers affordable rental options catered to Indonesia’s burgeoning middle class and millennials.
I’m pretty lucky – I managed to get a place just before prices started to rocket. But I can certainly empathize with my peers who have to deal with rising rents and housing scarcity.
Also, as someone who sees my house as a source of respite, I can’t imagine having to move every couple years just because a landlord decided to hike rents.
Anyway, Rukita is a reminder that there are companies out there with worthwhile missions, and I hope we see many more such firms get the funding they need to fulfill their goals and help people.

Thoughtful reads
1️⃣ How to properly adopt genAI
Generative AI was the new hotness in 2023 (and continues to be cool in 2024), but even though many have rushed to adopt the tech, the fact of the matter is that real adoption – not in terms of numbers, but actual depth of use cases – will take time. Just like any other technology.
This piece from Harvard Business Review offers some tips for doing so.
2️⃣ Literal moonshot
What’s it like to land on the moon while not being part of Nasa? This Masters of Scale episode, featuring Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus, touches on autonomous vehicles and 3D-printed engines as part of a conversation on the rise of commercial space exploration.
3️⃣ Don’t stretch yourself thin
I once interviewed some VCs on what they looked for in potential founders to invest in. Among a litany of traits and preferences, one common factor they shared was that they were unlikely to put money into anyone who was either still doing a day job alongside building their company, or working on two (or more) startups at once.
Apparently, being in either of those camps betrayed a lack of commitment to the startup in question. This Entrepreneurship Handbook article appears to say the same thing.
4️⃣ Are you sure your startup idea is a good one?
Not to flex, but in another interview I did – this time with a lead of a university entrepreneurship program – I learned that one of the earliest stumbling blocks budding founders face is that of idea validation.
Learning how to properly research whether a startup idea is market-viable or merely makes for a cool pitch deck is a key component in the firm’s success or lack thereof. First Round Review provides an in-depth guide to doing this properly.
5️⃣ A little more

Nikita Bier is a Silicon Valley founder whose social apps have been acquired by Discord and Facebook. He also claims to have coined a term: the Filipino product-market fit.
It means exactly how it sounds.
“Every year, a product manager would observe their new product getting intense adoption in the Philippines and proclaim their idea was working,” Bier wrote on his X account yesterday, referring to his time working at Meta. “Directors would quickly staff the team and alert their VPs of the newfound discovery – only to find out that the pattern was not reproducible in other countries.”
He went on to note that the country has one of the world’s highest time spent online. This is backed by data: according to research from Datareportal, Filipinos aged 16 to 64 spent eight hours and 52 minutes per day on the internet in 2023 – the third longest globally, after South Africa and Brazil.
“They will try literally anything for a few days,” Bier added.
At the time of writing, the tweet has garnered over 1 million views. Replies range from more earnest responses, references to a longtime shadow industry, to a roast.
But there are users from other tech companies who echoed Bier’s thinking, such as a former engineer at Tumblr as well as people from multiple startups – including one user touting Axie Infinity. The play-to-earn game, wrote the user, “basically got the flywheel going relying for like 90% on the Philippines in the early days.”
That’s not new information. Sky Mavis, the game’s Vietnam-based developer, said in a 2022 article that as much as 35% of traffic to Axie Infinity – and its biggest share of its 2.5 million daily active users – comes from the Philippines.
Irene Umar, co-founder of YGG SEA, told Tech in Asia at the time that the game’s rapid adoption rate among Filipinos is “because they can speak English.”
Still, despite becoming a popular earnings vehicle for many Filipinos in its early days, things have quieted down for Axie Infinity. And some users replying to Bier noted that several other countries – namely Australia, Canada, and New Zealand – make for better test beds.
Another suggested market also happens to be an important one for a certain Southeast Asian tech giant. “Brazil was the total opposite. It’s the place that everyone wants to do well in, but struggles,” tweeted an Nvidia engineer who used to work at Spotify and Tumblr.
In other words, “the Brazil product-market fit is real product-market fit,” another user wrote.

The Japanese government is reportedly in discussions with Southeast Asian countries about sharing QR code payment services. The potential linkages will let Southeast Asian travelers use their homegrown payment apps for transactions in Japan – and vice versa.
Should the plan proceed, implementation is expected to start by 2025. The talks involve bodies like Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry, as well as central banking authorities from Southeast Asian nations including Cambodia and Indonesia.
The Payments Japan Association, which runs the country’s QR code payment system known as JPQR, is already planning to build a new system that will link the current one to global payment providers by this year.
Such a move will be a continuation of a 2022 agreement where five ASEAN member states – Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines – agreed to create unified QR code payment systems. Thailand later became the first country to officially implement the system with Indonesia, followed by the latter’s integrations with Malaysia and Singapore.
In late 2022, Bank Indonesia – the country’s central bank – also signed a similar agreement with Japan. The deal involved integrating cross-border payments through the QR Code Indonesian Standard (QRIS) and the JPQR.

Shopee. TikTok. Paytm.
These are some tech firms that have recently been caught in the crosshairs of Asian regulators, for reasons including countries prioritizing political considerations over economic ones, the influence of developments in the West, and frustration that fines alone aren’t enough to deter bad behavior.
At best, investigations by regulators risk being a small annoyance. At worst, they can cut off revenue sources and affect how businesses operate.
TikTok Shop, the short-video app’s ecommerce arm, was forced to close its operations in Indonesia last October. It eventually made a comeback by merging with local ecommerce platform Tokopedia, part of the Indonesia Stock Exchange-listed GoTo Group.

Any schadenfreude that Shopee may have had over the fate of its competitor is surely tempered by the fact that it, too, is now facing regulatory scrutiny in Indonesia. The firm is being probed over its alleged monopolistic practices of directing users to affiliated shipping companies for deliveries.

These incidents may seem like a series of one-off, idiosyncratic decisions across disparate areas. But they also suggest that tech companies in Asia should prepare to face greater levels of regulatory scrutiny.
It’s raining regulation
Concerns over greater regulation of tech companies in Asia aren’t new.
In 2020, as the European Union (EU) drew up a “hit list” of 20 major internet companies to be subject to more stringent rules and the US Congress accused tech giants of abusing their market power, Southeast Asia also tightened its regulatory screws.
Industry experts Tech in Asia spoke with at the time had warned that Big Tech could expect enhanced oversight from Southeast Asian regulators in the areas of data, social media content, tax, and merger control.
A storm broke shortly after. In October 2020, Alibaba founder Jack Ma criticized China’s financial and regulatory system for stifling regulation.
He also called out traditional banks’ “pawn shop” mentality – making loans that are backed by some form of collateral – saying that it would not be able to support the country’s growing credit demands. A month later, Ant Group’s IPO was suspended.
Since then, regulators across Asia have intensified their scrutiny of tech companies.

Politics over economics
China’s crackdown on its tech sector is perhaps the best example of how shifting national priorities play a role in the greater level of regulatory scrutiny Big Tech faces.
Deng Xiaoping laid the foundation on which China’s major tech companies grew. During Deng’s rule from 1978 to 1989, the government made economic growth a priority “through the active introduction of foreign capital and technology.”
However, in the past few years, domestic and external challenges have led the Chinese government to prioritize “political and security concerns over rapid economic growth.”
Alex Capri, a research fellow at Asia-based think tank Hinrich Foundation, asserts that the “spectacular growth of companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, and Didi, ultimately, was detrimental to the Chinese Communist Party’s hold on power.”

In July 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) launched a probe into ride-hailing firm Didi after it “pushed ahead” with its listing in the US, which was against the CAC’s suggestion that it delay the IPO.
The move was ostensibly over Didi’s alleged illegal collection of users’ personal data, though “addressing possible national security risks” stemming from its US listing was floated as another reason.
Big Tech companies today wield a level of wealth and influence that can rival that of the world’s largest economies. In 2023, the net revenue of Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Facebook combined was around US$1.6 trillion, or roughly the size of Taiwan’s purchasing power parity GDP that year.
Tech firms can also influence the way people think and act, leading authorities to clamp down on them to garner the popular vote and minimize risks (such as a financial crisis) ahead of elections.
In the US, the House of Representatives has recently passed a bill that could lead to TikTok being banned in the country, ahead of the presidential and congressional elections this November.
Similarly, it’s no coincidence that Indonesia’s ban on TikTok Shop was announced months before the country’s presidential election.
In the same vein, the Reserve Bank of India’s order to Paytm Payments Bank (PPM) – the banking affiliate of fintech firm Paytm – to halt all banking services comes ahead of the country’s elections this year.
Rightly or wrongly, politicians may view such actions as helpful to garner support from a given constituency.

In Indonesia, the Jokowi administration has pushed digital businesses in the country such as TikTok Shop to show how they can “value-add” to the economy and not just view it as a large market they can sell things to, according to Hasto Suprayogo, a political marketing consultant and lobbyist.
Despite some observers dubbing the government’s move as a “political gimmick” to portray itself as nationalistic, Suprayogo tells Tech in Asia that there has been public support for this approach, which has created economic value in sectors like raw materials where it was applied.
According to him, this policy is likely to continue even after Jokowi steps down later this year, since his successor Prabowo Subianto ran on a platform of continuity.

Western influence, with limits
The approach Asian governments have taken to regulating tech companies has also been influenced by developments in the West.
For example, Southeast Asian countries started to adopt their own data protection laws after the European Union passed its General Data Protection Regulation.
The EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), which came into force in March, aims to regulate large online platforms that act as gatekeepers to digital markets, ensuring that they “behave in a fair way online.”
The DMA has been described as “a giant experiment in government micromanagement” of everything from Apple’s App Store to the Google search engine.
EU officials have been actively trying to garner support for their rules from their Southeast Asian counterparts. In October 2023, they toured Asia to convince governments to take its lead in adopting new AI rules for tech firms.
However, ASEAN has taken a more business-friendly and relatively hands-off approach to AI so far. An AI guide, released in February, is voluntary and meant to foster innovation.
This speaks to limits of the EU’s influence in this part of the world – countries will ultimately only adopt regulations that make sense to them.
From fines to stopping revenue lines
Historically, fines alone have not been enough to deter bad behavior by rich tech companies, thus leading to calls for stiffer penalties.
The RBI’s latest clampdown on PPM, for example, follows a monetary penalty imposed in October 2023, after the firm failed to comply with Know-Your-Customer regulations.

Photo credit: 123RF

Despite its warnings, the regulator found PPM to be in “persistent non-compliance,” which “warranted further supervisory action.”
Siddarth Pai, founding partner of early-stage VC firm 3one4 Capital, tells Tech in Asia that this “drastic step” of essentially shutting down PPM’s operations demonstrated that the central bank had “moved from levying fines to stopping revenue lines,” and that it was a “blunt way of driving home their disdain.”
In Singapore, the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) decided to scrutinize Grab’s proposed Trans-cab’s acquisition a second time, even after Grab made unspecified commitments to address its concerns.
The regulator’s relatively heavy-handed approach came after it failed to unwind a Grab and Uber merger in 2018. Instead, the competition watchdog levied a combined S$13 million (US$10 million) fine on the two ride-hailing firms.
This led to criticism from some quarters, with the CCCS being compared to a “toothless tiger.”
Double-edged sword
In the short term, other tech companies may benefit from the travails faced by their peers.
In December 2023, online retailer JD.com won a lawsuit against Alibaba, which was found to have abused its market dominance by adopting a “choose one from two” exclusivity policy that forced sellers to list products on Alibaba exclusively.
Similarly, tech lawyer Salman Waris, whose clients include India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, tells Tech in Asia that Paytm’s troubles “may be beneficial in terms of business in the immediate future for its competitors such as GooglePay, PhonePe, and RazorPay.”
In the same vein, if Grab is not allowed to increase its ride-hailing market share via acquisitions, this may benefit smaller players such as Tada, Bolt, and Be Group, which are trying to scale their presence in the region.

Photo credit: AngieYeoh / Shutterstock

But there are trade-offs.
Waris notes that the RBI’s crackdown on fintech firms in India may have “chilling” long-term effects on the entire fintech industry, hurting investment sentiment and dissuading new entrants.
Indeed, the situation in China has arguably gone too far, with US$1.1 trillion wiped off the valuations of Alibaba, Tencent, Meituan, Baidu, and JD.com between 2021 and July 2023, according to Refinitiv data.
Ultimately, the tech industry as a whole – from Big Tech down to fresh startups – will have to adapt to the new reality of greater regulatory scrutiny.
Pai of 3one4 Capital, who is also co-chair of the Regulatory Affairs Committee at the Indian Private Equity &amp; Venture Capital Association, says startups will have to adjust their attitude towards regulations, noting the “prevailing startup notion” that existing regulations serve “more [as] guidelines than anything else.”
He adds that Indian regulators are “not to be trifled with, especially in regulated financial services.”
Waris, the tech lawyer, concurs. Companies that want to “navigate regulatory challenges effectively” will have to invest more in compliance, risk management, and transparency in their operations, he notes.
Meanwhile, Suprayogo, the political consultant, suggests that tech giants targeting an Indonesia-based audience should establish a representative office in the country as a gesture of goodwill to the government.
Such firms could “conduct lobbying activities” to various state institutions should they find themselves at a disadvantage from regulations and policies, he explains.

Hello reader,
Do you remember the old anti-piracy ad that went: “You wouldn’t download a car?”
Actually, if that were possible, I think most people would have. Such were the days of Napster and LimeWire, when burned CDs became the modern-day mixtapes and provided the soundtracks to many adolescent years.
I’m clearly waxing lyrical about a bygone era, but if today’s premium article is anything to go by, that same energy over peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing still exists. And apparently, it’s fueling a desire to “break Amazon, Microsoft, and Google’s ‘monopoly’ in cloud computing servers.”
Read on to find out more.
Today we look at:

Whether P2P can beat cloud servers
South Korean traveltech firm Onda’s international journey
Other newsy highlights such as the US$16 million series A round of an Indian healthtech startup and Xiaomi’s EV debut


Premium summary
Sharing is caring

There are many names in today’s story, so let me help you summarize: Pear Runtime is the open-source software platform that allows developers to build P2P apps. It was launched by app developer Holepunch, which has Paolo Ardoino as its chief strategy officer and Mathias Buus as the CEO.
Ardoino is also the CEO of crypto firm Tether, which backs Holepunch.
Got it? OK, let’s continue with the rest of the story.


Strong words: Ardoino says he wants to break the hold of Amazon, Microsoft, and Google on the cloud computing industry. “We can prove that the entire model of client server – that has been pushed down the throat of developers for the last 20 years – has been in a way a lie. It has been completely dismissive of the reality that the internet was built to be peer to peer,” he says.

Bad rep: P2P has a reputation for enabling piracy – of music, movies, and other media – but Ardoino is unapologetic about its past and does not offer any solutions on how to protect against this issue.

Take the power back: Ardoino plans to attract developers to Pear Runtime by emphasizing the scalability and price of P2P networking. “You can do it directly from your computer without the need of paying tens of hundreds or tens of millions of dollars to Google or AWS,” he says. He also argues that client-server networks don’t scale easily or cheaply.

Startup spotlight
Onda way to more international expansion

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Traveltech startup Onda is looking to raise US$15 million in series C funds as it ramps up its expansion aspirations, which it had to pause amid the Covid-19 pandemic.


Origin story: Founded in 2016, Onda initially targeted small and medium-sized accommodations, such as vacation rentals and B&amp;Bs. Its tech helps hotels resolve issues related to room sales and operations.

First steps: By December 2022, the South Korean firm began reviving its international market expansion efforts as it raised US$10 million in a series B funding round. That fueled its investment in Thai hospitality startup Hoteliers.Guru and its Taiwan launch, where it initially partnered with 10 major hotel brands including the K Hotels Group, which operates nine hotels in Taiwan.

More to come: That said, founder and CEO Hyun-seok Oh believes there’s still a large untapped market that Onda can target. This year, the firm is focusing on expanding in Southeast Asia – mostly centered on Thailand – and in the Middle East and North Africa region.

840964,2024-03-15T09:00:13,2024-03-15T05:11:37,Meet the team that keeps the AWS data centers running like clockwork,meet-team-aws-data-centers-work,publish,post,https://www.techinasia.com/meet-team-aws-data-centers-work,"Last year, cloud computing data centers reached a significant milestone.
For the first time ever, the share of enterprise workloads run on on-premise servers – as opposed to cloud-based data centers – fell below 50%. Cloud is now the preferred choice.
As these data centers become more integral to companies’ global operations, it’s imperative that the right talent oversee them.

At cloud services provider Amazon Web Services, data center operations engineer Elsa Mathew Samuel as well as Anna Chua, one of the firm’s cluster managers in Singapore for infrastructure delivery, help to keep such data centers running optimally.
“We’ve got to maintain 100% uptime to deliver the best results for our customers, partners, and cloud users,” says Samuel.
Fresh opportunities
Landing her role at AWS came out of left field for Samuel.
“Having majored in mechanical engineering, I was more used to seeing traditional jobs that work with things like heating or ventilation systems,” she says. However, after she met with an AWS representative during a university recruitment initiative, a new path lit up.

“The more I knew, the more I liked it, and eventually, something clicked in me,” she shares. “AWS was always my dream company, too, so it was a good opportunity to explore other types of engineering.”
Chua, meanwhile, came from a rather different background. The computer engineering graduate had about two decades of experience in infrastructure operations before joining AWS in 2019 as a data center operations manager.
“I had a friend working in AWS Singapore who shared with me that there was an opening for that role,” Chua says. “The data center industry was booming, so I jumped at the opportunity.”
Despite the difference in how they got there, one common factor attracted both of them to the company: the opportunity to learn, grow, and expand their horizons.
“In IT, the industry moves as fast as lightning. If you get too comfortable with where you’re currently at, you’re not learning or growing as much,” says Samuel.
For Chua, it was an eagerness to learn from experts in the field that interested her
Smooth as butter
As a data center operations engineer, Samuel looks after the power delivery and cooling systems.
“Together with my team, we ensure we can provide 24/7 power to the servers,” she explains.
It’s a crucial job, as servers generate heat, and the only way to make sure it’s all systems go is to maintain “an ideal temperature.”

Preventing overheating sounds straightforward, but in practice, it’s a huge task – data centers often have a huge number of server racks. On the job, Samuel quickly found out that there was a lot of learning to do.
“A lot of the electrical engineering concepts were new to me,” she says. “One thing I found particularly difficult was the single line diagram (SLD).”
SLDs are extremely detailed, technical documents that lay out a set of equipment and infrastructure. Without prior experience in deciphering these, Samuel used to take 30 minutes to understand an SLD while her teammates only needed 10.
“Initially, it was a huge task for me every single time,” she shares.

An example of what an SLD could look like / Photo credit: Shutterstock

However, as someone who feels that it’s “better to face a good challenge head on,” Samuel resolved to find a better way. She began creating simplified SLDs in the form of flowcharts, which helped her shave down the time she spent on these documents. It now takes her about two minutes on average to comprehend each one fully.
“Everyone was encouraging and supportive of my efforts, and I even won an internal award for it,” she says. “Even though it wasn’t a particularly big invention, simplifying the SLDs was helpful since they are very dense documents.”
Samuel also credits her manager, Prasad Wasdikar, and her assigned buddy, Rajendra Ram, with supporting her through those early days. Wasdikar would slowly assign her electrical engineering tasks to build up her confidence, while Ram guided her at each step.
“[Ram] would help with even the slightest doubts I had – even down to things like how I should address other people,” she says. “They were both very warm and welcoming.”
Delivering results with speed
In Chua’s case, she – together with her team – is responsible for delivering network infrastructure to customers.
Part of her job is making sure that every single component, such as switches and routers, is in place to ensure full functionality.
“In the event that we need to scale up the bandwidth or network to host new types of technology, we must be able to do it promptly,” she shares. The rise of AI and machine learning services is an example of instances when new components need to be added to computational power, storage, and more.

Additionally, Chua and her team ensure that the proper cooling and power systems are added so that everything runs smoothly. In her past experience, this was a process with many moving parts that took up to a few months to complete. However, things go much faster at AWS.
“We have a highly scalable and reliable infrastructure, and processes are well-established so that we’re empowered to address demand promptly.”
To elevate her work even further, Chua developed a process to evaluate clients more thoroughly, allowing her team to put the best members forward to support their customers’ specific needs.
“That allowed us to craft a proper action plan, which helped us deliver projects on time,” she says. “If there’s an opportunity for us to do better, we train our teams up and close those gaps.”
Making their mark
Samuel and Chua have a lot on their plates, but that hasn’t stopped them from exploring other interests.
Samuel often volunteers to plan employee events such as sports days or celebrations for national holidays and festivals.
She also helped out with an AWS initiative called Girls’ Tech Day, which is aimed at encouraging school-aged girls to pursue their interests in STEAM subjects.
“I conducted workshops with middle and high school girls to talk about coding and creating robots,” she says. “They’re actually very interested and have lots of amazing ideas. One of the girls even told me she wants to be an aerospace engineer.”
As for Chua, she helps other AWS colleagues imbibe a Day One mindset as an AWS Culture Champ, which involves helping people stay constantly curious, nimble, and experimental in their approaches to work.
In IT, the industry moves as fast as lightning. If you get too comfortable with where you’re currently at, you’re not learning or growing as much
She’s also part of a management book club.
“I relate a lot with the lessons I learned from a book called The Agility Factor,” she shares. “It taught us how various companies incorporate an agile culture within their teams and how to embrace a Day One mindset.”
Amid their different responsibilities, Samuel and Chua agree on one thing: data center employees will always have a critical role to play.
“In the past, the demand was tied to storage computation and backups. Now, with ML and AI, many things are moving forward in exciting ways,” says Chua.
“As the need for servers and storage increases, the industry needs qualified talent to maintain those systems, which should provide a lot of opportunities for training and growth,” Samuel notes.

Pan-Asian insurance firm FWD has laid off employees in Singapore, sources told Tech in Asia. An industry source who declined to be named said the job cuts affected a “small number of roles,” with the figure close to 10 people.
FWD declined to comment.
After a first attempt to list in the US in 2021, FWD has delayed plans for a Hong Kong IPO twice, with the most recent postponement taking place in September 2023. An IPO might have netted the company US$1 billion, a more modest aim compared to its initial US target of US$3 billion, though it has also raised over US$1.8 billion in private placements between 2021 to 2022.
Last month, The Business Times reported that FWD was mulling options following the delayed IPO, including a stake sale that would value the company at US$10 billion.
However, FWD’s parent firm Pacific Century Group – the investment company owned by Hong Kong billionaire Richard Li – has since downplayed the report, saying that he was “confident” about the insurer’s long-term development.

One97 Communications, the parent firm of Indian fintech giant Paytm, has gained approval from the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) to become a third-party service provider on the country’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) infrastructure. The news sent Paytm’s shares up by 5%.
This clears the way for the company to launch UPI services backed by several financial institutions, including Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, State Bank of India, and Yes Bank.
Previously, Paytm had offered such services through an exclusive partnership with Paytm Payments Bank, which is 51% owned by Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma, with the remaining stake held by One97 Communications.
Paytm this month terminated intercompany agreements with its affiliate bank in an effort to simplify its corporate structure, among other benefits.
Aside from supporting Paytm, Yes Bank will also act as the merchant acquiring bank for current and new UPI merchants linked with One 97 Communications. The existing “@Paytm” handle on the fintech firm’s platform will now direct transactions to Yes Bank.
This development follows the Reserve Bank of India’s order for Paytm Payments Bank to stop its services starting March 15 due to compliance issues regarding know-your-customer processes as well as money-laundering concerns. The bank later faced a probe by the Enforcement Directorate, the Indian government agency that investigates economic crimes and financial fraud.

Healthcare plans often drown in a flood of vital but messy data, which can come from various sources like doctor’s notes and lab results. It’s a common occurrence across the industry, making it hard to organize and analyze information efficiently.
This is where India-based HiLabs comes in. The AI-powered healthcare solutions company says that its MCheck technology can process and clean up clinical data 100 times faster than humans.
Founded by Amit Garg and Neel Butala, HiLabs has gained US$39 million in a series B investment round led by Eight Roads Ventures and Denali Growth Partners. F-Prime Capital also participated.
HiLabs runs AI and machine learning R&amp;D centers in Pune and Bangalore, employing over 150 experts from reputable Indian institutions. Aside from further developing MCheck, the company also plans to use the new funds to expand its product team.
In a statement, Garg said HiLabs is entering the “next phase of growth.”
“We stand poised to propel our AI technology forward, empowering healthcare organizations to make swift, informed decisions based on data that’s not just clean, but readily available when it matters most,” he added.
India is seeing a rise in its healthtech market, which could reach US$35 billion by 2030 – a whopping 14x increase from 2022.
Eight Roads Ventures injected US$250 million into a dedicated fund for healthcare in India in May 2022.

Over the past few months, Animoca Brands has led a US$8 million round in Pixelmon and a US$3 million one into Japan-based startup Gacha Monsters, while also participating in an oversubscribed funding round into Singapore-based Imaginary Ones.
Now, the Hong Kong-based blockchain gaming and NFT firm has continued its prolific streak with a strategic investment into Param Labs, a gaming infrastructure startup from the United Arab Emirates.
The deal, whose amount is undisclosed, aims to accelerate Param Labs’ scalable Web3 infrastructure while expanding an ecosystem that includes over 50 intellectual property partnerships. This follows a recent partnership announcement between both companies.
Param Labs is a game development company specializing in multiplayer blockchain games and AAA design, which refers to high-budget games distributed by high-profile publishers. The firm’s flagship title Kiraverse is a multiplayer Web3 game of the third-person shooter genre. Players can compete, earn, and trade unique digital assets like characters and skins.
The company also offers a service called Pixel to Poly, which lets gamers transform 2D images into 3D playable characters. In addition to Kiraverse, the service is also compatible with Web2 games such as Grand Theft Auto V and Fortnite.
GameStop, Pudgy Penguins, and Mocaverse are among the partner brands of Param Labs, which has also partnered with global esports organizations to promote Web3 ecosystem growth.
This investment expands Animoca Brands’ presence in the Middle East and North Africa. Previously, the firm raised US$50 million from Neom, the Saudi Arabian government’s smart city project, to promote Web3 development in the area.

While some tech giants like Microsoft and Twitch are facing gaming woes, others in the space have garnered investor interest this year. India’s Nazara Technologies – best known for the mobile game World Cricket Championship – is pledging US$100 million for global expansion, while NFT gaming firms Pixelmelon and Imaginary Ones have announced new funding in recent weeks.
Now another Web3 gaming startup has joined the fray: Singapore-headquartered 9 Lives Interactive has announced a US$3 million funding round led by Mechanism Capital. Participating investors include Sfermion, 3Commas Capital, and Momentum 6.
An independent gaming studio, 9 Lives will use the funds to develop its debut game, a cat-themed hero shooter called Nyan Heroes. In the game, which uses Unreal Engine 5 as well as blockchain capabilities, “quirky” cats pilot powerful, highly customizable mechs – aka giant robots – in competitive battles to save the world.
“We grew up playing shooter games, and we believe that this is the next evolution, where cute cat heroes give this genre mass appeal, which will lead to both Web2 and Web3 player adoption,” said Max Fu, the studio’s creative director and CEO.
Fu transitioned into the gaming industry after an early career in medicine in Australia. The gaming studio, which is fully remote, also counts alumni from companies like Electronic Arts and Ubisoft as part of its team.
Currently in the pre-alpha stage, Nyan Heroes has seen over 13,000 sign-ups following a recent announcement of its early access launch.

The Indonesian Ministry of Communication and Information said it gave warnings on March 5 to six foreign-owned online travel agents (OTA) that are not yet registered as private electronic system providers. They were given five working days to register – otherwise, they may be subject to punitive measures including a block.
At the time of writing, only Agoda and Airbnb have registered with the ministry. Both companies’ registration dates are listed as March 12.
The other four – Booking.com, Expedia, Klook, and Trivago – are not yet on the registry. Other companies registered with the ministry include Line, Yahoo Indonesia, as well as Meta and its properties Instagram and WhatsApp.
The Indonesian government has tightened up its oversight of foreign tech companies since last year. TikTok Shop notably found itself banned in late 2023, which would be reversed following its acquisition of local ecommerce giant Tokopedia.
The government also announced plans to ban the sale of imported goods priced below US$100 on ecommerce platforms in the same year. The rule would apply to goods traded by foreign merchants.
Outgoing President Joko Widodo, meanwhile, issued a presidential decree last month that would require platforms like Meta and Google to compensate news publishers.
At the same time, Prabowo Subianto – who is set to become Indonesia’s next president should the election quick-count results are confirmed – has stated that attracting foreign investment will be a key focus for his administration.

Hello reader,
Confession: I buy a lot of stuff on Shopee. The ecommerce app is my first port of call whenever I need to purchase something.
Drawer organizers, sewing shears, sleeping shorts, retinol eye cream, a new phone – you name it, I probably got it on Shopee, unless I needed it urgently and couldn’t wait for delivery or it was cheaper on another platform like Shein.
And I know I’m not alone in this. Lots of people turn to Shopee when they need to buy something, all across Southeast Asia (and some parts of Latin America, too).
So it’s no surprise that it’s gotten a lot of attention at parent firm Sea Group’s latest earnings call. Indeed, Sea is pretty upbeat on its outlook for the ecommerce firm- my colleague Simon goes deeper in today’s premium story.
Today we look at:


Why Shopee’s in the spotlight after Sea’s 2023 results 
Singapore-based AI startup Sqreem’s acquisition of an Australian advertising firm 
Other newsy highlights such as Xendit’s expansion into Indonesia and Silicon Box’s chip factory plans in Italy

All eyes on Shopee

Sea Group announced its fourth quarter and full-year 2023 numbers last week. For the first time, it recorded a profit for its full-year figures, which led to a 17% increase in share price in the four trading sessions following the announcement.


Shopee in the spotlight: Shopee’s contribution toSea’s overall sales has surged over the years. In 2019, the firm accounted for 38% of the group’s total revenue – that figure grew to 69% in 2023.

Staying ahead of the curve: Despite having strong competition, Shopee’s management expects the firm to grow its top line and maintain its market share. The company looks to bolster this growth through unique offerings such as “return on the spot” and in-house services such as Shopee Express. 

For comparison: Full-year revenue at Garena, Sea’s gaming arm, declined by 44% in 2023 compared to the previous year. Meanwhile, adjusted EBITDA at SeaMoney, the group’s fintech unit, experienced a quarter-on-quarter decline in Q4 2023, the first time it had done so since Q3 2021.

While venture capital deals in Southeast Asia tripled between 2015 and 2021, exits have been hard to come by, challenging both investors and mature startups in the region, according to a new report by US-based research firm PitchBook.
“Nearly 87% of the exit value since 2015 has been generated by six exits of over US$1 billion,” noted the report, citing data as of December 31, 2023. With stringent regulations impeding startups from going public, cash returns remain “elusive” for many investors, said the paper, titled the “Southeast Asia Private Capital Breakdown.”
The analysis was made based on PitchBook’s collated proprietary data on the private capital market in Southeast Asia.
Still, the report underlined that Southeast Asia’s economy has continuously grown despite global headwinds, which helps maintain investor interest. From 2015 to 2023, the region’s gross domestic product grew more than 56%, said the report, citing data from the International Monetary Fund.
Venture capital deals, meanwhile, tripled from 525 to 1,711 between 2015 and 2021.
The deals reached their peak value in 2022 at US$18.1 billion. However, both deal value and count dropped sharply in 2023’s tech winter, studies have found.
Nonetheless, Southeast Asia’s young, consumer-driven economies continue to be major positives for investors – so much so that B2C companies are the second most-funded startups in the region. Such companies more than doubled their share of annual deal value, from 16.8% in 2021 to 36.2% in 2023.
Even with the double-digit growth in capital deals in the region, PitchBook noted Southeast Asia still has a lot of potential to grow, with “vast reserves” of capital still untapped. But that comes with a host of challenges.
“For many emerging private capital markets, the need to see strong, recurring returns can be the catalyst for sustained investment and development. This is the current weakness for Southeast Asia,” the report said.
For one, VC rounds worth US$25 million and more made up less than 9% of all rounds in the region between 2020 and 2023 – a key limitation for more mature startups.
“Unlike the US, where there is comprehensive financing coverage across the venture lifecycle, Southeast Asia lacks robust funding support for the later stages of venture,” the report said.
Fundraising activity also remains focused in Singapore, dubbed the region’s financial center, as firms there consistently tallied over half of VC deals from 2015 to 2023.
For startups seeking growth, it has been challenging to scale to generate considerable returns, PitchBook said. That has since led multiple startups of late to pursue global expansion at an earlier stage, including in higher-income markets like the US.

Carsome, a used-car marketplace headquartered in Malaysia, is reshuffling its leadership team ahead of an anticipated IPO.
Eric Chan, a former senior executive of Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage, has joined Carsome as group president and COO, the company announced in a statement.
Chan brings with him three decades of experience in the automotive industry across Singapore and Malaysia. This includes the managing director role at Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage’s Singapore subsidiary as well as chairman for a Malaysian unit that operates Mercedes-Benz dealerships in the country.
“Eric Chan’s notable career in automotive leadership, particularly his work at Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage, makes the industry veteran a valued addition to our Carsome family,” said Eric Cheng, co-founder and CEO of Carsome.
In addition, Aaron Kee, who has been Carsome’s COO since June 2023, will become the firm’s group chief business officer. Meanwhile, Juliet Zhu, who had served as the company’s president, will move to an advisory role.
These developments come after Carsome brought in Miguel Fernandez as its group CFO last November. Prior to his role in Carsome, Fernandez was the group CFO of Philippine fintech company Maya.
Carsome has been seeking a Malaysian government license for providing commercial vehicle inspection and ownership transfer services. Its rival Carro is also vying for the license.
In June 2023, Carsome raised an undisclosed amount of funding, which it said boosted liquidity to US$200 million. While the round appears to be part of its IPO preparations, the company has not announced when and where it will go public.

TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew / Photo credit: World Economic Forum

The lower house of the US Congress has passed a bill that would give ByteDance six months to sell off the US assets of its TikTok app, or face a ban.
The House of Representatives bill – titled the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act – passed by a lopsided vote of 352 to 65. However, it still needs a vote in the Senate – the upper house of the US Congress – where efforts to restrict the app have stalled previously.
Should the Senate approve the bill, US President Joe Biden said that he will sign it, after which it becomes law.
The move is the culmination of a yearlong row between ByteDance and US lawmakers concerned about the Chinese government’s influence on a social app with 170 million users in the US. It is also part of larger tensions between the US and China on various spheres, including tech.
In his past testimony, ByteDance CEO Shou Zi Chew had strongly denied allegations that the TikTok app has links to the Communist Party of China, among other things. Following the latest vote, Chew said in a TikTok video that ByteDance will exercise its legal rights to fight the ban, for which it has a 165-day window after Biden’s signing.
The US is not the only country where TikTok has met government blowback, though the degrees of restriction vary. Indonesia, for one, had banned TikTok Shop late last year, though a resolution is underway following TikTok’s purchase of Indonesian ecommerce giant Tokopedia.
Indonesia’s Trade Ministry has since announced that TikTok Shop’s back-end integration with Tokopedia – a key requirement of the deal – has finished ahead of schedule.

Hacking Growth co-author Sean Ellis / Photo credit: Tech in Asia

Aside from being highly successful startups, what do Dropbox and Eventbrite have in common?
For one, both startups “growth hacked” their way to success. Another is that Sean Ellis, the person who coined the term “growth hacking” back in 2010, shaped growth strategies at the two companies.
As Dropbox’s first marketer, Ellis was part of the brains behind the firm’s breakout referral program. This helped Dropbox climb from just 100,000 registered users in September 2008 to 4 million by December 2009, as well as reach US$1 billion in revenue run rate by January 2017.
Prior to Dropbox, Ellis also helped scale companies like remote-connectivity services provider LogMeIn and event ticketing platform Eventbrite. Since then, he’s co-authored the book Hacking Growth, which has sold close to a million copies globally.
He defines growth hacking as a scientific process of using data and experimentation to drive growth.
“You have to start with that growth mindset that says, ‘Are you doing anything perfectly in your business?'” he said. “And if you’re honest, the answer is no – there’s not a single thing that cannot be improved.”
Here are our key takeaways from Ellis’ fireside chat at a Tech in Asia subscriber event in Singapore on March 11.
1. Experiment, experiment, experiment
For Ellis, experimentation is the “only way” to figure out a better way to do things. But to drive rapid growth, it should be combined with surveying and user testing.
The latter involves studying what value people get from a product, why it’s a must-have, and what experiences make it valuable. After that, it’s all about replicating that same experience to more people, he said.
Once companies achieve this, they can start getting users into a habit of driving referrals, which ultimately unlocks growth – as long as they have found product-market fit. Otherwise, it won’t work, Ellis noted.
“If you don’t have a product that, once people try it, they consider a must-have, getting a lot more [people] to try it is not going to help you,” he said.
2. Implement early
Companies that have grown really quickly in the last 20 years – including ride-hailing and ecommerce platforms – don’t just adopt a growth hacking approach. According to Ellis, 99% of them also implemented the strategy “right in the beginning.”
For him, that’s why it’s “really hard” for large companies like Microsoft to adopt this approach, particularly when compared to a young firm that has less than 100 employees. Beyond their sizes, teams also have an entrenched way of working.
In other words, people “don’t want to change the way they’re doing things,” Ellis said.
3. The cross-functional piece
Driving growth over the long term “requires marketing teams, product teams, engineers, designers, all working together and using data,” Ellis pointed out. But getting cross-functional teams to work together is a big challenge.
As he noted, “marketing teams are not used to working with product teams,” while “engineers don’t like to take directions from marketing teams.”
To address this, he recommended two things. The first is for the company to appoint a person or team – aside from the CEO – who takes a big-picture view at how the business creates and delivers value to customers. They then coordinate efforts around those opportunities.
The second is that growth teams should either report directly to the CEO or a top executive, or be part of the product team.
“What I’ve learned over time is that as a company grows, the team that’s responsible for growth probably can’t carry a marketing title,” Ellis shared.
4. The Nubank example: power of referrals
One “interesting” growth story Ellis cites is Nubank. The Brazil-headquartered digital bank has 84 million customers globally as of June 2023 – a significant increase from the 54 million it had at the end of 2021.
“That massive growth has been almost entirely through word of mouth,” he observed. “Until very recently, they had not done any traditional marketing.”
According to Ellis, the digital bank has “built a religion” around asking how existing customers would feel if the product no longer existed. They then study the feedback from customers who said they would be “very disappointed.”
5. Evolution of growth hacking
As AI advances, Ellis does expect that the tech will change everything – including how businesses identify opportunities, ideate, and analyze results.
The technology can “potentially even change the way you work – AI might be able to do a lot of [this] instead of people,” he said, referring to the way cross-functional teams work.",Sean Ellis helped lead five startups – including Dropbox – to billion-dollar valuations.

Nazara Technologies CEO Nitish Mittersain / Photo credit: Nazara Technologies

India-based Nazara Technologies Limited is ready to take on the global gaming market. The Mumbai-listed gaming and media company, best known as the publisher of mobile game series World Cricket Championship, announced it is pledging US$100 million for global expansion over the next two years.
The move comes on the heels of a US$90 million fundraise through a preferential allotment of Nazara’s shares, the company said in a statement. To solidify its worldwide presence, the firm is looking into strategic mergers and acquisitions with a focus on established gaming intellectual properties and studios.
Nazara CEO Nitish Mittersain said the company aims to continue its “acquire and scale” strategy, which it applied in past acquisitions like esports company Nodwin Gaming, sports media platform Sportskeeda, and Paper Boat Apps, which created edtech app Kiddopia.
“We are particularly focused on investing in and acquiring gaming studios globally with a specific focus on India’s 500 million gamers as well as the large North American market,” Mittersain added. 
Nazara’s plans come as the global gaming industry is expected to be worth US$321 billion by 2026, according to a PricewaterhouseCoopers report. Having raised US$253 million in disclosed funding, Nazara also launched a game publishing arm late last year.
At the time of writing, Nazara’s market capitalization is 48.3 billion rupees (US$583 million).

India’s healthtech market could reach US$35 billion in size by 2030, a whopping 14x increase from 2022. A BCG report found that startups will be a main growth driver in the space, citing consumers’ positive reception to healthcare digitization.
One rising startup in the space is Sugar.fit, an India-based healthtech startup focused on treatment for diabetes – a relatively rampant disease in the country. According to the World Health Organization, about 77 million adults in India have Type 2 diabetes.
The company has secured US$5 million in an extension of its series A round. This brings the company’s total funding for the round to US$16 million.
B Capital, the VC firm established by Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin, led the extension. Previous investors in the series A round include MassMutual Ventures, Tanglin Venture Partners, and Endiya Partners.
Founded in 2021, Sugar.fit offers a subscription-based diabetes reversal program, which blends tech with personalized human interventions. Through the platform, diabetes doctors and nutritionists use tools like continuous glucose monitors and fitness trackers to monitor their patients’ condition in real time. Its solutions are used by over 30,000 users.
A subscription provides a glucose monitoring tool, a specified number of consultations with doctors, as well as access to its patented mobile app that can help track users’ blood sugar levels. According to Sugar.fit, 90% of users that go through its program see reduced blood sugar levels as well as decreased reliance on medication.
The firm also has a physical presence, operating seven diabetes clinics across Bangalore.
“India faces the challenge of managing a dual disease burden, marked by the increasing prevalence of chronic care conditions, notably diabetes,” said Karan Mohla, general partner at B Capital, in a statement. “Despite significant investments in healthcare, we continue to grapple with the enduring challenges of access, affordability, and quality.”
Sugar.fit said it will use the fresh funds to help increase brand presence while strengthening research and development.

Experience stops us from making the same mistakes we made in the past. It also teaches us how to spot and take advantage of the opportunities in front of us.
Experience as a founder is one of the advantages VC firm Febe Ventures hangs its hat on. It’s run by entrepreneurs-turned-investors who believe that their experiences growing their own startups allow them to provide other founders with helpful insights alongside funding.

A founder-first VC

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Olivier Raussin, co-founder and managing partner of Febe Ventures, has steered his Brazilian wine startup Evino back to growth amid a funding winter.
Raussin and his fellow partners at Febe Ventures have a combined history of building over 30 companies and backing more than 200 startups, so they’ve been around the block a time or two.


By the numbers: In November 2023, Febe Ventures (short for “For Entrepreneurs, By Entrepreneurs”) launched its second fund, which aims to raise US$75 million. Speaking to Tech in Asia, Raussin says the fund’s investments will be about US$250,000 for pre-seed and US$750,000 for seed-stage companies, with the main focus being on Southeast Asian firms.

Fundamentals: In this tough economic climate with many firms seeing their runway fast disappearing, Raussin advises going back to basics by working toward healthy unit economics and a sustainable profit and loss statement.

You win or you learn: Raussin admits he made plenty of mistakes as a founder, such as being too slow to release products and aiming to scale too early before achieving product-market fit. These are the sorts of errors he helps his portfolio companies avoid now.

Cards and funding on the table

Image credit: Timmy Loen

One of the veterans of Singapore’s fintech scene has raised US$75 million in asset-backed notes.
DCS Card Centre has now secured around US$300 million for its current funding round, following a US$225 million raise in December 2023.


Earmarked: The company said the funds will be used for its receivables from retail and corporate customers using its credit facilities. It also left the door open for exploring “future arrangements” with more fund houses and financiers.

Been around the block: Originally known as Diners Club Singapore, DCS brought cashless payments to the city-state in the 1970s. It is one of the country’s two non-bank financial institutions licensed to issue both credit and charge cards.

Change on the cards: DCS is looking to diversify its offerings after years of just issuing cards exclusively. Last year, the firm struck a deal with MasterCard and UnionPay to launch co-branded cashback cards, and plans to offer a similar product with Visa are in the works.

Traveltech startup Onda built a market-leading presence in its home country of South Korea through partnerships with the likes of Kakao, Naver, and Airbnb. In 2019, the company – which offers an enterprise solution that helps hotels manage operational processes like room distribution – began the first steps of a Southeast Asian expansion by entering Thailand.
Then, the Covid-19 pandemic began. In lieu of those plans, the company decided to expand its services within South Korea but catering to larger hotels and resorts.
“We developed Dive, a property management system for large chain hotels, and built global partnerships, including with Google Hotels, preparing to turn the crisis into an opportunity,” said founder and CEO Hyun-seok Oh in an interview with Tech in Asia.
However, with travel set to return to pre-pandemic levels, the company has rekindled its plans to scale internationally. Last April, Onda doubled down on Thailand with an investment in local player Hoteliers.Guru and followed that with an expansion into Taiwan.
Now, the company is looking to raise US$15 million in series C funds, said Oh.
Growing through the pandemic
Founded in 2016, Onda initially targeted small and medium-sized accommodations, such as vacation rentals and B&amp;Bs. Its tech helps hotels resolve issues related to room sales and operations.
When its expansion efforts were put on hold because of the pandemic, Onda instead transitioned to become a full-fledged hospitality tech company, offering a suite of SaaS solutions to its clients.
According to Oh, the company saw growing domestic demand for its digital transformation services, with Covid-19 restrictions forcing hospitality businesses to maintain room sales and operations with minimal staff. With Onda’s greater focus on its local operations, the company logged a 4x growth in its gross merchandise value – from US$56 million in 2020 to US$230 million in 2023.
“Previously, most large chain hotels in Korea relied on hotel operational solutions from American companies,” Oh said. Among its clients are several hotels owned by Ananti, a Korean luxury hotel chain.
By December 2022, Onda began reviving its international market expansion efforts as it raised US$10 million in a series B funding round. That fueled its Hotels.Guru investment and Taiwan launch, where it initially partnered with 10 major hotel brands including the K Hotels Group, which operates nine hotels in Taiwan.
Since then, the company – which has raised US$21.2 million in disclosed funding – handles distribution for over 700,000 properties through more than 50 online sales channels. It also services over 4,500 properties worldwide with its SaaS offerings.

That said, Oh believes there’s still a large untapped market that Onda can target. This year, the firm is focusing on expanding in Southeast Asia – mostly centered on Thailand – and in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, the CEO shared.
This is because in both regions, many hotels and accommodations still struggle to manage an increase in online sales amid a market rebound, he added. For MENA, Onda has partnered with Seed Group, a company owned by the Dubai royal family.
“Through M&amp;A and strategic partnerships, we aim to quickly localize our products, sales channels, and customer service to absorb the surging demand for digital transformation in the global hotel market,” Oh remarked.
While travel startups are not out of the woods yet, business has significantly improved: Southeast Asia’s travel GMV for 2023 was expected to be 5.4x higher compared to 2021, according to the e-Conomy SEA report.
Hong Kong-headquartered Klook announced a US$210 million fundraise last December, while Dubai-based B2B travel app Tumodo raised a US$35 million pre-seed round in January. That said, Indonesia’s Traveloka shut down its budget travel app Pegipegi in December.

As Apple winds down its electric vehicle (EV) plans, its smartphone rival Xiaomi will make a long-awaited entry into the global EV market. After introducing its first electric car – the Speed Ultra 7 (SU7) sedan – in December 2023, Xiaomi will start shipping the cars in China this month, Reuters reported.
Xiaomi has scheduled a launch event for the SU7 on March 28, at which point its 59 stores in the country will begin taking orders for the EV.
SU7’s launch reflects Xiaomi’s efforts to diversify its business after the stagnating demand for smartphones. The company had declared its commitment to invest US$10 billion in the automobile business back in 2021.
The event also coincides with the rising momentum of EV sales in China this year, which increased by 18% from January to February, the Reuters article noted. Xiaomi’s EV production is handled by state-owned automaker BAIC Group, whose Beijing factory has an annual capacity of 200,000 vehicles.
It’s unclear whether Xiaomi has any plans to bring its EV products to other markets, including Southeast Asia. According to an EY report, EV sales value across Southeast Asia is expected to hit between US$80 billion and US$100 billion by 2035.
Already present in the region are Xiaomi’s compatriots, such as Wuling and BYD. The latter is aggressively expanding in Southeast Asia, with plans to double sales in Singapore and the Philippines, while recently launching its first products in Indonesia.
Furthermore, Tesla stated that expansion into Southeast Asia is a priority, highlighting the market’s fast growth. To date, Tesla has obtained licenses to sell its cars in Malaysia and reportedly is in discussions to enter other countries, including Thailand.
That said, Xiaomi might be able to capitalize on its smartphones’ fairly strong brand in the region. According to a report from market research firm Canalys, Xiaomi holds Southeast Asia’s third-largest smartphone market share, which was at 15% in the third quarter of 2023.

Razer Fintech’s rebranding to Fiuu
The alleged financial misconduct of Investree’s ex-CEO and co-founder

Welcome to The Top Up! Delivered every fortnight via email and through the Tech in Asia website, this free newsletter breaks down the biggest stories and trends in fintech. Get it in your email inbox by registering here.

Hi there,
Several friends of mine have been waiting it out for months at their firms, which are seemingly on the brink of an IPO.
For many, the potential payoff of their employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) far outweighs the present burnout or lure of a more exciting role. A report by Saison Capital in 2021 found that one in five companies dissolves all options, including vested ones, upon employee departure. As a result, many employees grit their teeth and stay on, especially when an IPO seems on the horizon.
The same report found that on the whole, ESOPs at Southeast Asian companies tend to veer in favor of the companies, rather than the talent they’re meant to incentivize.
It’s clear that companies in the region are a long way off from their US peers in implementing such options – if at all. Still, it seems like an increasing number are demanding equity management solutions, and the growing revenue of East Ventures-backed Qapita reflects that.
In this week’s Big Story, my colleague Budi dives into Qapita’s financial results in its 15-month financial year ended March 2023. While the firm had grown its revenue to US$8.9 million in just 15 months, total costs had also increased 10x compared to 2021.
On the topic of financials, Fiuu – previously Razer Fintech – has said that it is operating at a “profitable level” and that revenues have “doubled over the past four years.”
I discuss the significance of Razer Fintech’s rebranding and what that bodes for its B2B payments business in this week’s Hot Take.

THE HOT TAKE
Scaling fintech services fast and Fiuu-rious

Razer’s new Southeast Asia headquarters in Singapore / Source: Razer

Here’s what happened:

Last week, Razer Fintech, the fintech arm of gaming hardware firm Razer, rebranded to Fiuu.
Razer Merchant Services, the B2B payments unit under Razer Fintech, will also go by the new name.
This will allow the fintech business to “continue its path independently from the Razer brand,” said Lee Li Meng, executive chairman of Fiuu, in a statement.

Here’s our take:
It’s hard to think of Razer and not think of gaming – the name immediately calls to mind its lime green and black gaming accessories. While that has worked in the Singapore-born firm’s favor for the most part, its gaming roots can be a double-edged sword as it eyes further growth in the fast-growing payments space.
Fiuu, established in 2018, was designed to serve a wide range of sectors from the start. In the first half of 2021, its payment volumes grew, driven mainly by ecommerce marketplace purchases, food deliveries, and e-wallet top-ups. Its merchants also hailed from all sectors including retail, F&amp;B, and professional services.
Distancing itself from its gaming-focused parent is apt considering its client mix through the years. Fiuu continues to serve firms from ecommerce, fashion retailers, F&amp;B, to financial services, with notable names such as Adidas, Starbucks, TikTok, and Foodpanda. This diversity also demonstrates Fiuu’s ambitions to scale further.
As a B2B solution, Fiuu provides a payment processing gateway similar to services offered by Stripe or Adyen. It enables businesses to accept local and cross-border digital payments via over 110 payment methods, from e-wallet and bank transfers to credit card payments. Fiuu also has an offline payment network of over 1 million acceptance points, where consumers can make bill payments, telco reloads, or payments for ecommerce purchases.
In its 2023 fiscal year, Fiuu’s total payment volume reached over US$6.6 billion – a 10% year-on-year growth compared to US$6 billion in 2022.
While large, it’s still a fraction of what payment giants are processing. For example, Stripe said that in 2022, it processed US$817 billion in transactions for businesses, growing 26% from the year before.
Still, Fiuu’s strength could lie in its regional connectivity in online and offline platforms. While most payment gateways operate in just one or two countries within Southeast Asia, as Lee noted previously, Fiuu sees an opportunity to be the one payments partner for Southeast Asian companies that want to scale regionally.
The firm is certainly working hard to keep its offerings relevant. In January, it partnered with Philippines-based buy now, pay later (BNPL) platform BillEase so businesses that work with Fiuu can offer installment payments to their customers.
Current macro conditions haven’t been cheery. Rising inflation and interest rates, coupled with a dip in ecommerce spending in 2023, led revenue to slow sharply at rivals like Stripe, compared to pre-pandemic levels.
In H1 2023, Adyen’s revenues grew 21% year on year – its slowest growth rate on record. While full-year revenue in 2023 was up 23% year to year to €1.6 billion (US$1.8 billion), this paled in contrast with pre-pandemic levels: Between 2018 and 2019, full-year revenue jumped 51%.
Southeast Asia faces a similar challenge – between 2022 and 2023, ecommerce gross merchandise value increased 6% to US$138 billion, but this was a decline from the 16% growth the region saw between 2021 and 2022.
Now privatized, Razer no longer needs to publish its financial filings for all to scrutinize. Still, Fiuu has shared that it is now operating at a “profitable level” and its revenues have “doubled over the past four years.” Perhaps the rebranding will give Fiuu the added exposure it seeks.

Peak XV’s Shailendra Singh on stage at Tech in Asia Conference 2023 / Photo credit: Tech in Asia

Peak XV, previously known as Sequoia Capital India and Southeast Asia, is set to launch a fund supported by its own team, a source close to the company told Tech in Asia.
Called the Peak XV Anchor Fund, it will be a perpetual investment vehicle. In this vehicle, permanent capital is managed for an unlimited period in contrast to a typical VC fund, which has a 10-year cycle.
The fund would leverage its internal balance sheet and make investments into Peak XV’s main funds.
Sequoia had introduced a perpetual fund model for its Sequoia Fund in 2022, but it was limited to its US and Europe operations.
The company did not share why its Asia business was excluded, but VCs that Tech in Asia spoke to at the time noted how the region may not have been ready for perpetual funds. Most investment firms then were still following the 10-year investment horizon, which has been popular since the 1970s.
While Peak XV’s leaders have been contributing to the company’s main funds, Peak XV Anchor Fund would be the first time that their involvement is institutionalized, Tech in Asia‘s source said. The new fund would also allow Peak XV to align better with the goals and visions of ita limited partners.
The Peak XV team will also collaborate with fund managers across regions for the new fund. The VC firm announced the new fund at a two-day gathering of over 100 global investors, according to the source.
While the person did not comment on the fund’s size, Peak XV Anchor Fund is said to be starting small and will “compound over time.”
The development was first reported by TechCrunch, which suggested that the fund aims to invest in new fields for Peak XV.
Peak XV has invested in over 400 companies, with around 40 exceeding US$100 million in revenue. Peak XV controls over US$9 billion in assets under management.

Two Singapore-based cultivated seafood startups, Shiok Meats and Umami Bioworks (formerly known as Umami Meats), are merging. Sandhya Sriram, CEO of Shiok Meats, announced the news in a LinkedIn post, adding that the transaction will close “in the coming weeks.”
Mihir Pershad, Umami Bioworks’ founder and CEO, will lead the company post-merger, as reported by food and climate publication Green Queen. The merged entity will use the Umami Bioworks name while retaining the Shiok Meats brand.
Pershad said the merger is a stock deal that will see Umami Bioworks acquire all of Shiok Meats’ assets, though he did not disclose the transaction’s amount. While some Shiok Meats employees will join Umami Bioworks, Sriram will leave the company, six years after founding it.
The deal is a major development for Southeast Asia’s still-nascent alternative meat industry, but especially so in Singapore, where the market has developed enough for its government to work on regulatory frameworks for novel foods. This has attracted multiple foreign startups to set up shop in the city-state, and it has also led to the growth of local players like Meatiply.
However, data from foodtech VC firm AgFunder showed that global funding for cultivated meat companies declined sharply in 2023.
In an interview with AgFunderNews, Pershad noted that Shiok Meats “couldn’t see a clear path” to raising the next, larger phase of capital, which “everyone is struggling to get at the moment.” He added that Umami Bioworks’ B2B, asset-light model gives it a clearer path forward “without needing that large raise.”
Founded in 2018, Shiok Meats focused on cell-based crustacean products. According to Tech in Asia’s database, it raised US$20.7 million in total disclosed funding, with its latest fundraise being a bridge round in 2021.
Meanwhile, Umami Bioworks focuses on high-value and endangered species like grouper and eel, while also offering an automated tech platform in partnerships with other food companies. It has raised one disclosed round of funding – a US$2.4 million bridge investment in 2022.
Last year, Shiok Meats lost half of its team following two rounds of layoffs and the departure of several employees due to doubts about the company’s future.

840565,2024-03-13T04:00:49,2024-05-20T09:27:59,Zalora’s no longer the fashion shopping site you used to know,zalora-forges-identity-ecommerce-enabler-touting-growth-platform-services,publish,post,https://www.techinasia.com/zalora-forges-identity-ecommerce-enabler-touting-growth-platform-services,"Twelve football fields. That’s the approximate size of Zalora’s regional fulfillment hub in Shah Alam, a 90-minute drive from Kuala Lumpur’s city center, where several million items await shipment.
A majority will eventually be shipped to Zalora’s customers in the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. Many, however, will find their way to customers of third-party brands who purchased the goods from another ecommerce marketplace – like Shopee or Lazada – or directly from a brand.

Zalora is betting that its fashion and logistics know-how that it accumulated over a decade of operations, along with its active user base of 2.4 million customers as of Q4 2023, will make it the ecommerce enabler of choice for third-party fashion brands.
These brands may be looking to enter or scale up in Southeast Asia, a region expected to deliver some US$186 billion in gross merchandise value (GMV) by 2025.
For the Global Fashion Group-owned company, which sells a mix of goods from over 300 brands as well as its own, expanding platform services to third-party firms has been years in the making. Now, Zalora is turning things up a notch.

Here’s the pitch: Its three fulfillment centers in Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines can hold inventory for brands no matter the digital channel they’re using – even competitors like Shopee and Lazada. Zalora’s over 70 logistics partners in six Asian markets gives brands access to a wide distribution network. It even offers same-day delivery in some markets.
So far, the company has signed up over 30 brands, including H&amp;M, Mango, and Superdry, to its warehousing and logistics solution 1SS.
Speaking to Tech in Asia from Kuala Lumpur, Zalora’s regional director for platform services Matej Urban notes that the firm is “moving beyond the Zalora marketplace … We see ourselves a bit more as an enabler of fashion in the region.”
Already, platform services contributed 12% of Zalora’s revenue in 2023.
Returns – the big pain point
As a fashion-focused platform, Zalora does better than general marketplaces on several counts.
“Logistics is very special in fashion because you have such a high returns rate,” Simon Torring, co-founder of marketing intelligence platform Cube Asia, tells Tech in Asia.
On average, some 24% of online apparel orders are returned, according to research and advisory firm Coresight Research.
Zalora’s more than 10,000 return points across the region facilitate the swift handling of returned orders.
Torring notes that handling returns requires specialized skills to prepare them for reselling. These include assessing their quality, reattaching product tags, and ironing or steaming the apparel if needed.
This is “not something that Shopee or Lazada would ever be able to do,” he says.
Still, Zalora’s Urban is well aware that the firm has entered a market that is “quite saturated” with ecommerce solutions, with no lack of options for brands seeking help with selling their products online.

In Southeast Asia, ecommerce enablers like aCommerce, Leap Commerce, and Synagie already provide end-to-end solutions that include online store management, last-mile logistics, marketing, and customer support.
However, most of these players cater to a whole range of categories and aren’t fashion-specific. Thailand-based aCommerce, for instance, services clients from the fashion, electronics, healthcare, and pharmaceutical sectors.
Marketplaces like Shopee and Tokopedia, meanwhile, have strengthened their in-house logistics services over the years. Many also provide sellers with basic marketing support, though those services are generally limited to driving sales on their own platforms.

Urban emphasizes Zalora’s operational strength and its ability to offer an “exceptional customer experience.” Its fulfillment center in Malaysia, for instance, has a processing capability of 150,000 items per day. He adds that during its Singles’ Day event last year, the company delivered 98% of orders on time and in less than three days on average.
Partner or competitor?
One big question, however, is whether Zalora is able to demonstrate that it can support brands equally on all the trade channels that they want, even on competitor marketplaces.
“If [Zalora] can find a way to answer that question, that’ll be a very strong proposition,” Cube Asia’s Torring notes.
Indeed, aCommerce has made a point to stay independent and platform-agnostic precisely to avoid this bind, a trait its CEO Paul Srivorakul is proud of.
“Brands want to work with us because we make it easy for them to integrate with – and have the option of [using] – all the other platforms and other marketplace models out there,” Srivorakul tells Tech in Asia. “We do not compete with any of our clients.”

Zalora also offers production solutions for brands, including shooting catalogs and editorial spreads. / Photo credit: Zalora

Urban admits that Zalora’s platform services are geared toward maximizing sales on its own platform. “Driving revenue on Shopee and Lazada … is something that we don’t have so much interest in,” he notes.
He adds that maximizing exposure beyond Zalora falls outside the firm’s scope as a multichannel fulfillment solutions provider. That said, its fulfillment services and supply chain infrastructure – including Zalora’s “green lane” status at Malaysia’s customs – are designed to support a brand’s various sales channels.
As an authorized economic operator, Zalora goods can move through customs fast, without the need for special inspections.
Its status as a public bonded warehouse in Malaysia also means sellers don’t have to pay import sales and service taxes on goods entering the country. These will only have to be paid once the products are sold.
The challenge would be – does Zalora help you on Lazada, on Shopee, [and] all the other fashion retail sites?
It’s in other value-added services that competing specialized ecommerce enablers have an edge.
For instance, aCommerce offers tools that let brands unify sales data across all channels they sell on, identify what promotions are working, analyze their market share and how they’re growing compared to competitors, as well as track top-selling products, to name a few.
For big brands, “the challenge would be – does Zalora help you on Lazada, on Shopee, [and] all the other fashion retail sites?” Srivorakul points out.
While “up-and-coming” or “niche” fashion brands looking to test the Southeast Asian market might find Zalora a compelling partner, “the moment that brand becomes big, they’re not going to want to be limited to one partner,” he notes.
Still, Srivorakul recognizes the edge that vertical marketplaces like Zalora have, particularly around tech and services catered to the fashion category. He adds that features such as “virtual try-ons, live fashion shows, and personalized embroidery” are opportunities for Zalora to differentiate itself as a marketplace and service provider.

Some brands are biting. Between 2022 and 2023, GMV of third-party brands using Zalora’s 1SS grew over 300%.
According to Zalora, 75% of its top 50 brands use its marketing services – including affiliate marketing, video ads, and onsite banners. Some, like Puma and Under Armour, are also tapping its advertising services.
Urban adds that a majority of the firm’s brands use “at least two [platform] services.”
High touch to profitability
Zalora’s push toward value-added services like logistics, marketing, traffic generation, and even customer service – what Torring terms a “high-touch” approach – can be explained by a desire for continued profitability in a competitive space.
While the firm posted a positive EBITDA margin of 0.7% in 2022, it swung to negative 0.7% in 2023.

Net merchandise value – which refers to the value of both marketplace and retail goods being sold through the platform – also fell 15% year on year to 336 million euros (US$368 million) during the same period. The figure includes value-added taxes, goods and services tax, and delivery fees, after actual or provisioned rejections and returns.
That said, gross margins improved by 1.1% between 2022 and 2023, a feat that Global Fashion Group attributed to “increased marketplace and platform services share.”
“Zalora is in a very interesting spot where it’s too small to be just light-touch,” Torring points out.

The alternative, a “light-touch” model where it’s “a marketplace and nothing else,” means a fairly low take rate reliant on high transaction volumes to sustain the business, he explains.
Zalora’s absence in markets like Thailand and Vietnam – both of which it offloaded to Thailand-based fashion retailer Central Group in 2016 – could further limit its strategy.
“This is a real problem because it means [Zalora] cannot approach a brand and say ‘Come with me, I will bring you to Southeast Asia’,” Torring notes.
Bigger ambitions
Despite some early traction, Zalora’s work is far from done.
With demand for livestreaming support on the rise, the firm is toying with the idea of renting out its production studios for external shoots and livestreams. This puts it in line with enablers like Social Bread in Indonesia, which provides studios that live hosts can rent and stream sessions from.
Zalora is currently experimenting with a few third-party brands, with the eventual goal of scaling the service, though any rentals will have to take into account internal filming and shooting schedules, Urban says.
Anything that has to do with fashion – in fulfillment, in supply chains – we want to be there.
The firm also plans to expand its fulfillment services beyond digital channels to include a brand’s physical stores. It’s currently piloting the service with a few of its clients.
By this year, brands working with Zalora will also be able to cross-list items on The Iconic, Global Fashion Group’s ecommerce arm in Australia and New Zealand.
“Anything that has to do with fashion – in fulfillment, in supply chains – we want to be there,” says Vykintas Mineikis, Zalora’s regional senior operations director.
The firm may be confident that its expertise in fashion will continue to set it apart from other ecommerce solutions providers out there. But Zalora still has its work cut out to convince brands to sign on.

Crypto exchange OKX has secured in-principle approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore to operate with a Major Payment Institution License.
The move enables OKX to launch digital payment tokens and cross-border remittance services within the regulatory framework of Singapore’s Payment Services Act.
The crypto exchange joins a growing list of companies that have secured the same approval in Singapore. These include fintech firm Payoneer Singapore and fellow crypto exchange Upbit Singapore.
OKX was founded in 2017 and has grown to have over 50 million users worldwide. It is also the second-largest crypto exchange by 24-hour trading volume.
The firm’s announcement comes as Bitcoin – which heavily deflated in value in 2022 – recently hit a new all-time high, carried by increased interest from investors and markets warming up to the use of the token.
In addition to its exchange, OKX also has its own wallet offering called OKX Wallet. The platform helps users get into NFTs, the metaverse, and the trading of GameFi and decentralized finance tokens.
Hong Kong-based Animoca Brands recently announced that OKX Wallet would be one of the wallet partners for Mocaverse, the membership network project by the Web3 giant.

Sqreem Technologies, a Singapore-based company specializing in digital behavior analysis, has acquired Trade Indy, an advertising firm from Melbourne.
This move aims to bolster Sqreem’s AI-driven audience targeting and insights capabilities for agencies and brands. This involves optimizing campaign effectiveness, enhancing digital consumer engagement, and ensuring greater transparency in advertising expenditures.
Founded in 2014, Trade Indy is a team of 28 professionals that help companies plan, execute, and optimize multichannel digital marketing campaigns. In addition to Australia, Trade Indy also has a presence in Southeast Asia, Middle East, and North America.
Both Sqreem and Trade Indy also see the acquisition as a move to expedite their client expansion and expand global reach, according to their statement.
Sqreem was founded in 2006 and provides B2B solutions using AI to analyze digital behavior. These solutions cater to enterprises in advertising and various other commercial fields.
It also specializes in healthcare data analysis. During the height of the pandemic, it launched a Covid-19 data-tracking tool in the Philippines to help hospitals and policymakers make more informed decisions.

After recently hitting positive EBITDA, Indonesia-based AwanTunai has secured US$27.5 million in a series B round led by Norwegian sovereign fund Norfund, Japanese corporate VC firm MUFG Innovation Partners, and Finnish impact investment vehicle OP Finnfund.
With the help of the newly acquired capital, AwanTunai is aiming to hit positive profit after taxes.
Dino Setiawan, the Indonesian firm’s co-founder and CEO, said that the company will use the new funds to strengthen its equity base and expand its lending capital facilities to cover over US$2 billion worth of annualized inventory purchase financing by year-end.
“We only need to grow our volumes to around 3 trillion rupiah (US$193 million) a month to achieve initial economies of scale,” said Setiawan. “In the world of lending, that’s actually quite a small loan book, reflecting how efficient our business model is compared to alternatives in the market.”
Setiawan, alongside ex-Gojek executives Windy Natriavi and Rama Notowidigdo, founded AwanTunai in 2017. It provides loans to grocery suppliers and traders in Indonesia.
According to the Tech in Asia database, this round brings AwanTunai’s total disclosed funding to US$71.5 million. Previously, it raised US$8.5 million in series A funding from the International Finance Corporation, Global Brain, and Insignia Ventures Partners.

Hello reader,
Mark Zuckerberg’s “move fast and break things” motto is something of a mantra for a lot of folks in the startup space.
While the second half of the phrase is pretty controversial (I mean you can argue that Facebook broke democracy in more than a few countries), there’s still a lot to be said for the concept of moving fast.
After all, most startups are trying to build products that are either completely new concepts or take a fresh approach. So first-mover advantage is critical.
Governments and their surrounding bureaucracies are notoriously slow to make decisions, so how can startups hoping to win funding from institutional investors move fast?
Today’s featured premium story tackles that very subject in Malaysia, where there are big gaps between government policies to fund entrepreneurship and how those policies are put into practice.
Today we look at:


More haste and more speed needed in Malaysian funding game 
Proptech firm Rently expands into Singapore’s commercial real estate sector
Other newsy highlights such as funding for the NTU spin-off that’s trying to improve stroke treatment and TikTok facing scrutiny in the US, again.


Premium summary
The state of state funding for startups in Malaysia

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has given the country’s government-linked investment companies (GLICs) a mandate to invest in startups and tech firms.
While GLICs are typically conservative investors, some of them have already been setting aside small sums for tech investments. However, significant gaps remain between funding policies and funding disbursement in practice.


Everything is political: All the GLICs report to the prime minister and finance minister in one form or another, and their investment decisions are somewhat subject to the policies of the day. Affirmative action schemes dictate that they must concentrate their investments on local startups led by Malays, the country’s dominant ethnic group.

Speed is of the essence: Despite these affirmative action policies, it’s tedious for startups to actually get their hands on funding. GLICs must submit their investment proposals to the Finance Ministry, a panel then scrutinizes the proposal before briefing the minister, who either approves the investment or pushes it back. Sources told Tech in Asia that this process can take months, and in some cases, it has led Malaysian startups to lose out on funding rounds.

Leader of the pack: Sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional can lay claim to the title of least risk-averse GLIC. It typically invests directly in mature startups and as limited partners in funds targeting early-stage firms. Its startup and tech investment vehicle Dana Impak has an allocation of over US$1.2 billion across five years, with the money coming from Khazanah’s books.

Rently, a Singapore-based startup combining finance and property tech, is expanding into two new verticals: co-working and cloud kitchens.
The firm is partnering with co-working hub The Working Capitol and ghost kitchen services provider Smart City Kitchens for the new move.


Business model: Rently, which launched its services in January of this year, offers deposit-free rentals by handling tenants’ rental deposits on their behalf.

New pastures: The firm is bringing a similar approach to commercial real estate. The new partnerships aim to offer businesses access to workspaces and culinary hubs without being burdened by high up-front costs.

Nascent: Rently was founded in 2022 but only began offering its services this year. It is aiming to raise a series A fund by the first quarter of 2024.

Silicon Box, a Singapore-based semiconductor firm, plans to invest 3.2 billion euros (US$3.5 billion) into building a chip factory in northern Italy, Bloomberg reported. However, the government didn’t reveal the sources of this investment’s financing.
Italian Industry Minister Adolfo Urso made this announcement after failing to attract US chipmaker Intel to the country, the report noted.
Once fully operational, the factory is set to provide up to 1,600 jobs. It will focus on producing chiplets, which takes a modular approach to building processors and allows for the creation of more energy-efficient systems.
This move marks a significant step in the growth of Italy’s tech sector in the face of rising global chip demand. The global semiconductor market is projected to grow 13.1% this year to US$588 billion.
In January, Silicon Box raised US$200 million in funding, pushing its value past US$1 billion. The company’s key investors include BRV Capital, Event Horizon Capital, Lam Capital, and TDK Ventures.
The firm said at the time that it would use the funds to expand its chiplet tech globally and support the development of large language models, generative AI, mobile computing, data centers, and automotive tech.
Silicon Box was founded in 2021 by industry veterans, including the billionaire husband-and-wife duo behind US-based semiconductor firm Marvell Technology.
The startup enables chip designers to transition from single-chip processing to a chiplet architecture. Its US$2 billion factory in Singapore has been mass-producing chiplets since October 2023.

Indonesian fintech unicorn Xendit has expanded its business to Thailand, extending its market presence in Southeast Asia.
The payment gateway firm – which already operates in Malaysia, the Philippines, and its home country of Indonesia – appointed its co-founder, Tessa Wijaya, as the CEO of its Thailand business.
In a statement, the company said that the potential of Thailand’s digital economy was a key factor in its decision to enter the country. According to Google’s e-Conomy SEA 2023 report, Thailand is the second-largest digital economy in Southeast Asia, projected to grow to between US$100 billion to US$165 billion by 2030.
Xendit said it will adapt its service strategies according to local business needs, similar to its approach in Malaysia and the Philippines.
“With our hyperlocal expertise and global best practices, we will be bringing more local payment methods and direct integrations to banks in Thailand that can help to catalyze economic progress and drive positive change for the communities,” Wijaya said in the statement.
In Thailand, Xendit will compete with incumbents such as TrueMoney and Rabbit Line Pay. The two companies reportedly hold more than 75% of the nation’s electronic money market combined. These players are vying to lead the digital payments segment in the country, where 94% of the population is said to have used cashless payments.
Launched in 2015, Xendit currently serves over 6,000 clients across its markets, ranging from SMEs and ecommerce startups to large enterprises.
The firm claims to have processed 320 million transactions per year via payment processing, international money transfers, business operations, and shop management.
In January, it laid off hundreds of employees as part of its efforts to streamline its business. This marks the second round of job cuts for the company, following a retrenchment in August 2023 that affected a “small number” of employees from its product team.

Hey there!
Last weekend, I was on a road trip with my friends to Jaisalmer, the desert city of India often known as the gateway of the Thar Desert. It was spontaneous, and to us, the destination seemed less important than the journey itself.
That’s what the early tech boom in Southeast Asia felt like – exciting and a little chaotic, but full of potential.
But now, the route’s getting a little bumpier for the region. Companies are being forced to map things more carefully and focus on efficiency.
In this week’s first Big Story, my colleague Huong explores if the lower funding in the region is an indication of a tech bubble that’s about to burst.
That said, this downturn has sparked a new wave of strategies and innovation for Southeast Asian startups as they look toward a broader expansion strategy to draw the eyes of investors.
In this week’s second Big Story, my colleague Emmanuel dives deep into the state of startup funding from Malaysian government-linked investment companies. The long process has led to hurdles for firms looking to raise funds, despite Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim’s push for more investment in the country’s tech ecosystem.
Finally, in AI Odyssey, I discuss how the Indian government’s rushed approach to regulating AI companies might do more harm than good for the development of this nascent sector in the country.

AI ODYSSEY
Promising AI projects we’re noticing
Will India’s AI bureaucracy kill the next big tech breakthrough?
Last week, the Indian government issued an advisory requiring tech companies to seek its approval before launching any of their genAI tools to the country’s users.
This announcement came following a complaint about Google’s Gemini producing biased responses as it said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was fascist.
The incident elicited a response from IT minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar, saying that it was “an irresponsible, unplanned, and hasty launch” of the generative AI platform and that it was in violation of the country’s IT rules. In response, Google issued an apology to the Indian government.
Prior to this, the country’s regulators had been lenient on genAI, with almost zero plans to regulate large language models (LLMs).
The incident brings about the question on whether this type of decision taken in haste will ultimately hinder the growth of India’s AI sector.
Those supporting the government’s stance argue that it’s a necessary step to protect Indian citizens from potential harms caused by unregulated AI. Chandrasekhar underscored the importance of accountability and ethics when dealing with tech that affects people’s daily lives.
However, the advisory has drawn criticism from AI startups and developers who fear this new regulation will impede innovation in the sector.
“While presumably well-intentioned, this approach is misguided at best and destructive at worst,” Brad Kasell, principal technology strategist for Asia Pacific at US-based data analytics firm Domo, tells Tech in Asia.
Kasell is of the opinion that the AI genie is well and truly out of the bottle and even if “permissions” were the right approach, it is an impractical obligation. He says that organizations at the forefront of AI development are moving at breakneck speed and cannot afford the lengthy delays bureaucracy would impose.
“It is incredibly presumptuous to assume that (lagging) government regulators are in any position to evaluate emergent LLMs, let alone approve them,” he adds.
Kasell also believes that this is an exercise in being seen to do something in a space that is both vague and fast-moving, rather than effectively guiding or developing the industry. Requiring permission before launch slows down the development process and adds a layer of bureaucracy that could disadvantage smaller players.
Furthermore, the advisory lacks clarity in several crucial areas. After Chandrasekhar received backlash for the announcement, he clarified that only “significant platforms” would need the government’s permission, with no explanation as to which firms would fall under this definition.
For instance, would Ola’s KrutrimAI fall under this definition, or does it only apply to LLMs from international firms like Google or OpenAI?
Would other Indian LLMs like farmer-focused Kissan GPT be required to seek government permission for their product launches?
Pratik Desai, founder of KissanAI, took to X to voice his disappointment regarding the regulation.

In addition, the requirement for AI models to be labeled as “under testing” could become permanent, given that even the most advanced systems are known to produce inaccuracies occasionally.
Instead of stifling pre-launch permissions, a regulatory framework emphasizing transparency and clear labeling of AI models could be a more effective way forward.
This would better inform users about potential biases and limitations, allowing for informed consent while still encouraging the growth of India’s AI sector.

DCS Card Centre CEO Karen Low / Photo credit: DCS Card Centre

DCS Card Centre, one of the oldest players in Singapore’s fintech scene, announced that it has secured S$100 million (US$75 million) in asset-backed notes. This brings its total funding for the round to roughly US$300 million, following a US$225 million raise in December 2023.
In a statement, DCS said the new funds will be used for the company’s receivables from retail and corporate customers using its credit facilities.
Following the deal, the company also revealed the possibility of exploring “future arrangements” with more fund houses or financiers.
Tech in Asia has reached out to DCS for comment.
DCS, formerly Diners Club Singapore, introduced cashless payments in the 1970s. It is one of only two non-bank financial institutions in Singapore holding licenses for credit and charge cards.
After decades of exclusively issuing cards, DCS now aims to diversify its offerings through partnerships with other players. Last year, it partnered with MasterCard and UnionPay to offer co-branded cashback cards, with plans to launch a similar product with Visa soon.
In October 2023, DCS onboarded Tin Pei Ling, a member of the Singapore parliament, as its managing director for strategic partnerships and business development.

MyTukar, a Malaysia-based used car ecosystem, has been renamed to Carro – taking after its parent company.
The rebranding process will take several months, during which the Carro brand name will be incorporated across myTukar’s range of products and services, marketing materials, and physical signages across Malaysia.
“We’re profitable as a group. We’re IPO-ready and in a position to list the company as soon as it becomes realistically possible,” Carro co-founder and group CEO Aaron Tan said in a statement.
Derrick Eng, who has been CEO of myTukar, will continue to lead Carro in Malaysia.
MyTukar started its partnership with Carro in 2017 following a US$30 million investment from the Singapore-based company aimed to bring about digitalization in Malaysia’s used-car industry.
In 2022, myTukar adopted an orange color palette similar to Carro’s signature shade.
Founded in 2018 by Fong Hon Sum, myTukar sought to transform the trading process of secondhand cars through its digital platform.
Carro, meanwhile, is one of Southeast Asia’s largest online platforms for used cars. The company is currently operational in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Japan, Taiwan, and Hong Kong – a market Carro recently entered after acquiring its peer Beyond Cars.
The firm had recorded its highest-ever EBITDA of US$4 million for the financial year ending March 2023, and it expects to achieve a 10x growth in EBITDA in FY 2024.

840078,2024-03-12T02:00:42,2024-03-12T05:18:47,"Tether CEO wants to break Microsoft, AWS, Google’s hold on cloud computing",tether-ceo-break-microsoft-aws-googles-hold-cloud-computing,publish,post,https://www.techinasia.com/tether-ceo-break-microsoft-aws-googles-hold-cloud-computing,"Paolo Ardoino, CEO of crypto firm Tether, says he wants to use the same technology that broke the music industry in 1999 to break Amazon, Microsoft, and Google’s “monopoly” in cloud computing servers.
To do so, the man in charge of the world’s largest stablecoin has launched an open-source software platform called Pear Runtime, which allows developers to build peer-to-peer (P2P) apps. And, he’s bringing crypto’s anti-establishment ethos with him.
“We can prove that the entire model of client server – that has been pushed down the throat of developers for the last 20 years – has been in a way a lie. It has been completely dismissive of the reality that the internet was built to be peer to peer,” he tells Tech in Asia.
The new platform was launched by app developer Holepunch last month as a side project of Ardoino and Tether. Ardoino is the chief strategy officer of Holepunch while Mathias Buus, who has worked on P2P technology for the last 10 years, is the CEO.

Holepunch is backed by Tether Operations Limited – headquartered in the British Virgin Islands – which operates Tether tokens and the Bitfinex crypto exchange. It also has backing from Hypercore, a developer of peer-to-peer systems.
So far, one major app has been released on the Pear Runtime platform. Called Keet Mobile, it’s a texting communication app that uses a P2P network and end-to-end encryption.
The app’s alpha launch on January 30, 2023 was limited to texting, though audio and video calls are planned for future releases, and the app can also be used to send files.
With Pear Runtime, Ardoino expects to spark a wave of development.
“Hordes of developers should start developing on this technology to take down the centralization that exists in AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure that make up 70% of all the services in the world,” he says.
What is P2P and why did it go away?
If you’re struggling to remember how P2P software works or wonder why it was an issue, then you certainly don’t remember the ‘90s.
P2P, unlike client-server networks, allocates the network tasks equally to all the devices – known as peers – on the network. There is no centralized administrative server system.
Napster was probably the best known P2P application. The app was used for trading files, usually movies and music, often illegally. The platform launched in 1999 but was forced to temporarily shut down in 2001 after it settled the lawsuits filed by musicians and recording companies.
Other P2P firms like LimeWire and Kazaa quickly took its place, but by 2009, the legal pressure on companies had effectively turned P2P networks into an internet boogeyman.
It’s like if you produce a kitchen knife, are you liable because someone is stabbing someone else with that?
Many internet service providers cut the bandwidth of suspected P2P networks in an effort to combat piracy, although there is still at least one network that uses the BitTorrent protocol: The Pirate Bay.
The cumulative damage done to recording artists by P2P networks is hard to quantify, but the impact on the recording industry was significant. In 2011, the Recording Industry Association of America sued Kazaa for US$72 trillion, although it later settled for US$105 million.
Tera Consultants for the International Chamber of Commerce found that in 2008, 10 billion euros (about US$10.9 billion) and 186,000 jobs were lost in Europe to piracy.
And this is the technology that Ardoino wants to resurrect. He’s unapologetic about its past and does not offer any solutions about how to protect against a resurgence in P2P’s proclivity for illegal intellectual property transfers.
He even argues that any illegal activity on a Pear Runtime-produced app would not present an issue of liability for Holepunch or Tether.
“It’s like if you produce a kitchen knife, are you liable because someone is stabbing someone else with that?” Ardoino quips.
Future technology or legal honey pot?
The Tether CEO also seems unfazed by the prospect that Pear Runtime is helping combine three of the most criticized digital technologies in the past 30 years: P2P, crypto (via integrated Web3 wallets), and end-to-end encryption.
Web3 is still recovering from the fall of numerous exchanges after the TerraLabs crash, and end-to-end encryption is repeatedly attacked as a hindrance to law enforcement trying to combat money laundering and terrorism. The combination seems like a magnet for lawsuits and government interference.
When asked what Holepunch could do to mitigate any legal liability, Ardoino’s answer seems evasive but not unexpected from the head of a well-known and often combative crypto company.
“The only thing we can do is to ensure that our open-source license and our disclosures are really clear – that this is open-source code that people can use, and they have to take their own responsibility,” he says.
In short, he argues that any legal liability that might occur on a P2P network would lie with the company that developed the app and not with the platform.
“You wouldn’t sue Red Hat, Ubuntu, or Microsoft for the operating system,” he notes.

When pointed out that Microsoft was sued over abuses on its operating system in 1998, Ardoino sticks to his argument, even adding that lawsuits are a “necessary evil to being innovative.”
“So in a way, there is a war between people that randomly sue others and the necessity of humanity to evolve,” he says. “And honestly, we are not scared about that.”
He says that the platform’s responsibility is to make sure its code works, is built on open-source libraries, and is freely available for users. Lawsuits “wouldn’t stop our internal push of innovation,” he says. “Ethereum and Bitcoin were born in that way.”
Ardoino admits to incurring hefty legal bills, as Tether is famous for its long list of legal issues.
In 2019, New York state Attorney General Letitia James said the state’s investigation found that Tether had engaged in a cover-up to hide the loss of US$850 million in client and corporate funds.
There have also been a near constant stream of issues regarding the backing of the company’s USDT stablecoin, which is pegged to the US dollar and is backed by real-world assets.
You can do it directly from your computer without the need of paying tens of hundreds or tens of millions of dollars to Google or AWS.
As of this month, Tether is the third-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of its market cap.
In the fourth quarter Tether reported net profit “of US$2.8 billion, of which about US$1 billion in net operating profits.” The company said it earned interest primarily from US Treasuries, with the remain operating profits coming from the appreciation of gold and bitcoin reserves.
Both bitcoin and gold has seen significant increase in value over the past six months.
Despite claiming that USDT was 100% backed by assets, Tether’s lawyer admitted in 2017 that the coin was only 74% backed by real-world assets. Tether even admitted at times that it had no reserves to back the stablecoins in circulation for periods of time.
Ardoino – who was previously Tether’s CTO – became its CEO in December 2023.
More recently, the United Nations specifically mentioned USDT as the preferred choice for crypto money launderers in East and Southeast Asia due to its stability, ease of use, anonymity, and low transaction fees.
Tether fired back saying it was working in collaboration with global law enforcement including the US Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the US Secret Service to monitor transactions on the network.
Developing Keet
According to Ardoino, Tether devoted five years and US$10 million to develop Holepunch and Keet Mobile. There is “no cap” to what Tether may invest to educate people about P2P, he says.
Ardoino plans to attract developers to Pear Runtime by emphasizing the scalability and price of P2P networking.
“You can do it directly from your computer without the need of paying tens of hundreds or tens of millions of dollars to Google or AWS,” he says. He also argues that client-server networks don’t scale easily or cheaply.

There are pros and cons to both types of networks, according to software engineers.
High-speed servers deliver high-speed results, while peer-to-peer networks are typically slower. P2P also tends to put a larger strain on the computational resources available to each peer, but it avoids being “bogged down by extra steps” during transfers.
There is also the question of maintenance. If a cloud server goes down, it can affect service until it is fixed. In the event of disruptions in a P2P network, peers would just redistribute the workload.
The worries about the liability and notoriety of P2P has led to the emergence and dominance of companies such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. Cloud computing is expected to reach US$690 billion in revenue in 2024.
Ardonio also criticizes the lack of transparency in the code used by larger tech companies, calling the closed-source code on centralized servers “risky.” He says that by using open-source software, developers don’t have to worry about how their data is treated by large companies who may try to monetize it.
What’s Tether getting out of this?
It also isn’t clear how the redevelopment of P2P apps will benefit Tether, although Ardoino points to a number of possible ways that revenue streams could be created.
The first is that elements of Web3 technology have been included on the Pear Runtime platform, including the ability to include crypto wallets into P2P apps, which means that USDT can be used to facilitate payments.
He says Holepunch is also considering adding consulting fees in the future, but there are no plans to charge developers a percentage of their revenue as fees.
So for now, Holepunch will watch and monitor how developers respond to the platform.
“We’re rolling it out,” Holepunch CEO Buus tells Tech in Asia. “We’re getting feedback from users and already seeing tons of people join. So just from a technical and short-term thing, we’re just excited to see people build on Pear Runtime.”
Will Ardoino ever get to see P2P break the “monopoly” of AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud? Possibly not, but if it does happen, he says he won’t be sad about it.

AI Singapore (AISG) and Google Research are collaborating to improve datasets for training and evaluating large language models (LLMs) in Southeast Asian languages.
Under Project SEALD, which stands for Southeast Asian Languages in One Network Data, the pair seeks to enhance the capabilities of such models, making them more useful across the region for the benefit of society.
Beginning with Indonesian, Thai, Tamil, Filipino, and Burmese, Project SEALD wants to create rich and diverse datasets for languages spoken in Southeast Asia.
One example involves the use of LLMs to bridge communication gaps with underrepresented migrant worker communities in Singapore, where individuals may be more fluent in regional languages than in English. Training LLMs with more culturally relevant data will help foster stronger engagement between the Singapore government, employers, and the migrant worker population.
“This [project] will open new opportunities and make AI more inclusive, accessible, and helpful for individuals and businesses throughout the region,” Yolyn Ang, vice president of Asia-Pacific business development at Google.
Additionally, SEALD will contribute to the development of AISG’s model Sea-Lion (Southeast Asian Languages in One Network). AISG and Google also plan to make the datasets and findings from Project SEALD available to the public through open-source channels.
Meanwhile, Google also has a similar partnership in India called Project Vaani, which focuses on the South Asian country’s diverse speech data across its 773 districts.

Malaysia-based coffee chain Koppiku has raised US$2.5 million from Vertex Ventures, Reshape Ventures, and others, according to Alternatives.pe, which tracks regulatory filings in Singapore.
The startup’s share price has increased by over 7x from the previous round in August 2023, the data showed.
Tech in Asia has reached out to co-founder Rajiv Bhanot for more details.
Founded in 2023 by Bhanot and Mellisa Lim, the startup aims to make premium coffee accessible to all. Its beverages are priced between 5 ringgit (US$1.07) and 9.90 ringgit (US$2.13), excluding substitutions and add-ons.
Koppiku had launched its maiden store in Kuala Lumpur in September 2023.
The company is backed by prominent figures like Bhanot’s younger brother, Sachin Bhanot, who is Prosus Ventures’ head of investments for Southeast Asia, Australia, and New Zealand.
Koppiku also counts AC Ventures managing partner Hann Yeoh and Antifragile Ventures – backers of Philippines’ Pickup Coffee – as angel investors.
Total coffee consumption has been growing in Malaysia – and as consumption rises, so does competition. Koppiku competes with homegrown as well as international coffee chains in Malaysia such as ZUS Coffee, Gigi Coffee, and Indonesia’s Kopi Kenangan.

Elon Musk’s xAI is set to open-source its chatbot and ChatGPT rival Grok, TechCrunch reported based on Musk’s post.
The announcement comes amid Elon Musk’s legal battle with OpenAI and Sam Altman – one of the people Musk co-founded OpenAI with.
Musk accused the firm of deviating from its open-source ethos in favor of profit maximization alongside its backer Microsoft.
Grok, currently available as part of X’s Premium+ subscription service, is touted for its prowess in handling real-time information, powered partly by the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.
The decision to make Grok’s code publicly available aligns with Musk’s long-standing advocacy for open-source technology.
Tesla, in the past, released many of its patents to the public. Similarly, X has shared some of its algorithmic processes.
For Grok, the move to open-source is expected to contribute to the ongoing discourse on AI development and accessibility, the report noted. It also places xAI among a growing list of open source-friendly companies in the AI space, among which are Meta and Mistral.
Grok was announced to the public late last year. At the time, Musk said the tech was more powerful than ChatGPT 3.5.

Hello reader,
Investree, a peer-to-peer lending startup focused on Indonesia, is going through a rough time, to say the least. Its co-founder Adrian Gunadi was terminated from his role as CEO early this year, facing allegations of financial misconduct. Indonesia’s financial regulator is also conducting an in-depth probe of the firm.
In addition, the startup is facing other issues. It recently said that setbacks in loan repayments on its platform are leading to delays in the return of funds to creditors.
Its US$231 million series D funding round has also been questioned since Investree has been revealed to have secured a US$7 million “rescue package.”
However, there’s another question mark in this situation – JTA, the lead investor in Investree’s series D fundraising. Doubt has been cast on whether the investment firm will go through with the agreement – we go deeper in today’s premium story.
Today we look at:

In October 2023, Investree announced that it had raised US$231 million in a series D round led by Qatar-based investment firm JTA. However, there’s uncertainty as to whether JTA will be able to follow through on investment agreements.


Question marks: Tech in Asia could not verify some key facts regarding JTA, including its CEO Amir Ali Salemizadeh’s educational background. Reaching out to other JTA investees, we only heard back from one company, Quetta Gladiators, where an executive declined to comment, saying that the project JTA invested in is confidential and in development.

A freelancer speaks out: Reza Zandieh, a former freelancer for JTA, shared that he had brought over 15 projects to the firm, though it did not invest in any of them. Aside from losing business relationships, Zandieh said that he and other freelancers lost more than US$10,853 over two years while bringing potential deals to the firm.

Lying dormant: Salemizadeh said that he had US$1.2 billion in the bank account of JTA’s dormant UK entity, according to 2021 and 2022 filings with the Companies House. It’s unclear why an entity with no business activity would have such a large sum of money.

Indonesia-based Rukita, a proptech firm that offers affordable rental options, has raised US$15 million in a series B1 funding round.


The P-word: Founded in 2019, Rukita said that it recently became profitable. It earns from managing over 1.4 million rooms across Indonesia

Who it caters to: The company targets Indonesian millennials as well as the country’s growing middle class. It said that it has over 3 million users that visit its platform each month.

Expanding the family: In March 2022, Rukita acquired Infokost, a room rental marketplace that was previously under Djarum Group’s GDP Ventures.

South Korea-based JB Financial Group is securing a 3.9% stake in Infina, a retail investing app based in Vietnam, The Korean Herald reported.
With the deal, JB Financial aims to facilitate its further expansion in the Southeast Asian country. The company already has a presence there with a brokerage unit called JB Securities Vietnam.
JB Financial’s acquisition is subject to increase to 5% depending on the results of collaboration between JB Securities Vietnam and Infina.
Hanoi-based JB Securities Vietnam offers financial services such as stock brokerage and corporate bond issuance management. Infina, on the other hand, allows users to invest through a wide range of products, including fixed-income instruments, mutual funds, and stocks.
The deal to acquire a part of Infina is the latest in a string of JB Financial deals in the fintech space. It signed an investment agreement to acquire a 15% stake in Hanpass, a Korean firm offering international remittance services, in December 2023.
Earlier that year, JB Financial had also participated in the US$36 million series C round of Finda – a loan brokerage and management company – alongside 500 Global.

Image credit: Shutterstock

There’s a popular saying that goes, “People who live in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones.”
But what do we say to the people who built the glass house?
This question hit me when I read a couple reviews on Glasswall aimed at Tech in Asia. (We’re leaving them up, by the way.)
One reviewer said, “Why is Tech in Asia allowing founders to attack VCs? How does this make the ecosystem more collaborative?”
Another lamented, “It’s a pity to see that Tech in Asia [does] not step in to stop social bullying.”
On the flip side, founders are telling us not to censor feedback. They have also convinced us to take a censorship-free approach with Glasswall.
But “censorship-free” does not equate to a free-for-all.
Yes, we’ll resist removing reviews as much as we can. But we’re also releasing features that will let the community boost helpful reviews and nerf unhelpful ones.
This is a top priority for us: The product and engineering team have cleared their plates to work on this and ship it as quickly as possible.
This week, we’ve launched a slew of features to nudge people towards writing better reviews. Here’s a quick look at them.
Feature #1: Submit reviews as a registered user
Previously, reviews could only be submitted anonymously – no need for a Tech in Asia account.
That has changed. We’re now giving you the option of writing feedback as a registered user.

To be clear, you can still submit reviews without signing into your account. We do want to preserve privacy for those who seek it.
Feature #2: Reviews from registered users will get a ranking boost
We’re sorting reviews based on a number of signals. This means that all things being equal, a remark from a registered user will be more visible compared to a completely anonymous one.
Feature #3: Labeled reviews
We also want to help users discern the nature of the reviews.
To do this, we’ll label reviews to indicate whether the writer has declared that they’ve been funded by the investor, and whether they’re an anonymous or registered user.
Feature #4: More moderation tools
Finally, we’re giving the community greater control over which reviews get priority placement.
In addition to an existing “Helpful” button, we’ve introduced “Not Helpful” and “Report” buttons right below each review.
Here’s a look at what the reviews look like now, complete with labels and moderation tools.

These enhancements are designed to improve the quality of reviews and to encourage more accountability from reviewers.
To reuse the glass house analogy, we’re looking to build thicker walls that reduce harm while still letting the light shine through.
We have more feature updates that are in the works.

Hello reader,
Ecommerce plays a crucial role in my daily life. Whether it’s groceries, medicines, or clothing, I depend on online shopping for my essential needs.
The convenience and vast options offered by ecommerce players are hard to beat. I have attempted in-store shopping a few times, but online platforms consistently draw me back.
So I was not surprised to learn that for Sea Ltd’s (SE, NYSE), its ecommerce arm Shopee accounts for nearly 70% of overall sales. Despite being in the red, its revenue and gross merchandise volume have experienced accelerating growth, pointing towards a promising year for the ecommerce company.
Forrest Li, Sea Group’s CEO and founder, believes that Shopee will maintain its market share in 2024 even as it faces intense competition in Indonesia from a combined TikTok Shop-Tokopedia entity. This will go a long way towards building investor confidence in Sea’s growth prospects.
But the question is, will this growth eventually translate into earnings? And if so, by when? My colleague Simon analyzes this and more in our Big Story this week.

THE BIG STORY

Sea’s upbeat outlook on Shopee drives enthusiasm, but can it deliver?
Sea ended the year with over US$8 billion in cash, short-term investments, and other liquid securities.

3 Trends to keep an eye on
Hot stocks, earnings reports, restructuring, pressure from activist investors, and more.

1️⃣ Pulling the plug on BNPL: Indonesia-based Bukalapak (BUKA, IDX) has discontinued its buy now, pay later service, BukaCicilan.
The move comes after several companies including Atome, ShopBack, and Pace have either scaled back their BNPL services or ceased operations altogether.
The one bright spot is Indonesia’s Akulaku, which was allowed to resume offering BNPL services after weeks of restrictions imposed by the country’s regulator. It will be interesting to see how Akulaku steps up its BNPL offering amid the retreat of so many players.
2️⃣ On-demand in the black: Southeast Asian super app Grab (GRAB, NDAQ) ended the December 2023 quarter on a profitable note. It posted a profit of US$11 million, a first for the Singapore-based company. The on-demand service of its Indonesian counterpart, GoTo (GOTO, IDX), also turned profitable in Q4.
As these companies turn the corner, it signals the coming of age of on-demand services in Southeast Asia and promises more riches for shareholders.
3️⃣ Nykaa (NYKAA, BSE) goes Nysaa: India-based Nykaa has kicked off its international expansion after opening a store in Dubai. Called Nysaa Beauty Store, it will house over 150 international brands. The beauty ecommerce company aims to establish 100 Nysaa stores in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region in the next five years.
Baby ecommerce firm FirstCry, which plans to list in India this year, has also seen GCC’s potential. The company intends to allocate US$19 million from its IPO proceeds to enhance its presence in the region.
The GCC may emerge as the next significant growth frontier for Indian ecommerce companies, which have been targeting increased order values.

The one you didn’t see coming
We spotlight the story that had everyone talking and social media buzzing during the past week.

PropertyGuru’s listing in NYSE / Photo credit: NYSE

PropertyGuru (PGRU, NYSE) opts for layoffs to restructure: The proptech firm has axed roughly 5% of its workforce – that’s 79 employees, to be precise.
This was unexpected, considering PropertyGuru has been profitable for two consecutive quarters, generating US$820,000 in income for Q4 2023.
CEO Hari V. Krishnan cited changing customer needs and a volatile market in Southeast Asia as the main factors for the decision.
This shows that profitability alone does not guarantee job security for employees in tech. There are numerous factors that could lead to job cuts, such as restructuring amid the emergence of generative AI.
Only time will tell if PropertyGuru’s actions to ensure “long-term sustainability” will really pay off.

Just roughly two months after its launch in Singapore, Rently, a startup that combines finance and property tech, is expanding to two new verticals.
The company said it has partnered with co-working hub The Working Capitol and ghost kitchen services provider Smart City Kitchens. With these collaborations, Rently now offers its customers – including startups, solo entrepreneurs, and SMEs – access to workspaces and culinary hubs without the burden of upfront costs.
“This initiative marks a shift in how our members can now allocate their resources more effectively towards the growth of their businesses,” said Ben Gattie, founder and CEO of The Working Capitol.
Rently was founded in 2022 by Dominic Schacher, Tarik Stafford, Siebren Kamphorst, Emeric Martin, and Turan Kutlay Kunbi. However, the company only launched its services in January 2024, and it’s now aiming to raise a series A round by the first quarter of this year.
At launch, the company offered deposit-free rentals, which it does by handling tenants’ rental deposits on their behalf.

A medtech spinoff from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) Singapore is looking to expand the presence of its rehabilitation services in the US with a fresh US$5 million raise.
Called Synphne, the company aims to improve the treatment of stroke and neurological conditions.
Its core product is a wearable device that aids in the rehabilitation of individuals suffering from illnesses like stroke as well as brain injuries. Aside from the US, it also aims to tackle Singapore and India, among other markets.
Synphne uses a blend of neural feedback, gamification, and data analytics to provide a customized and real-time perspective on a patient’s recovery process. This method allows users to undergo rehabilitation in both clinical and home environments.
One of the company’s backers in the series A round is Event Horizon Technologies, an affiliate of the Nadathur Group. The group is the family office of Nadathur Raghavan, co-founder of digital services and consulting firm Infosys.
Synphne was incubated under the NTUitive program and has received support from various Singaporean research and enterprise initiatives, including the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology, the National Medical Research Council, and the National Research Foundation.

The firm hit its first-ever profitable year, though it was in the red in Q4.
Shares in the New York Stock Exchange-listed company are up by 17% in the four trading sessions following the release of these results.
Much of the positive reaction had to do with a company guidance provided by management, especially in relation to its outlook for ecommerce arm Shopee, which led various analysts to raise the target prices for Sea.
In a nutshell, the firm’s management expects Shopee’s top line to grow and for the company to maintain its market share – despite strong competition – and to do so profitably.
See also: Sea hit first profitable year in 2023, eyes positive EBITDA for Shopee in H2 2024
DBS Bank analyst Sachin Mittal called the guidance “positive and surprising.”
The decision to provide such an upbeat guidance helped lift sentiment and convinced investors to look past a mixed set of results, particularly at Garena and SeaMoney, the group’s gaming and financial services businesses, respectively.
Full-year revenue at Garena, which has long been a cash cow for the group, was down by 44% compared to 2022. And adjusted EBITDA at SeaMoney experienced its first quarter-on-quarter decline since the third quarter of 2021. This was due to a doubling of sales and marketing expenses on its fintech business from the previous quarter.
Sea Group CEO and founder Forrest Li explained that the company was taking advantage of the seasonal uptick in sales during the fourth quarter to acquire new SeaMoney users, which will bring “better profitability in the long term.”
The billion-dollar question
Why is the market so focused on Shopee?
Over the years, the ecommerce business has accounted for an increasing share of Sea’s overall sales. Its share of the group’s total revenue between 2019 and 2023 has risen from 38% to 69%.

While the business is still loss-making, Shopee’s growing contribution to overall revenue – if the trend continues – should translate into earnings that are comparable to or even exceed those of Garena.
For example, if we were to apply the 10% adjusted EBITDA margin that Shopee achieved in the first quarter of 2023 – it’s highest to date – to its sales for the whole year, that would translate to around US$900 million in adjusted earnings. That’s compared to the US$921 million that Garena – which has an adjusted EBITDA margin of 42% – generated in that period.
Whether Shopee can consistently achieve the “if” above is the billion-dollar question.
Last year, Sea lost US$10 billion in market value following its results for the second quarter of 2023.
Investors took fright at the prospect of Shopee going back into the red with its plans to ramp up investments in livestreaming to compete with TikTok Shop, especially in Indonesia. This came after the ecommerce platform managed to eke out three consecutive quarters of positive adjusted earnings between Q4 2022 and Q2 2023.
Indeed, the third and fourth quarters of 2023 did see Shopee go back to recording negative adjusted earnings.

GMV growth in the high teens
This time around, Li acknowledged the “environment of intensified competition in Southeast Asia” but claimed that Shopee had actually seen a “meaningful gain in market share” in 2023.
Crucially, he said he expects that Shopee would “maintain” its market share in 2024, which would be supported by gross merchandise value (GMV) growth “in the high teens range.” However, he also mentioned that Shopee’s adjusted EBITDA should “turn positive in the second half of this year,” meaning that GMV growth won’t come at the expense of the bottom line.
Shopee’s performance in the most recent quarter certainly drove investor confidence in the guidance by management. Both revenue and GMV growth accelerated throughout 2023, an indication that, so far, its investments seem to be paying off.
While the platform still lost money in Q4, its adjusted losses narrowed from the previous quarter too.
Beyond this, investors may have been reassured by Li’s responses during the earnings call Q&amp;A, where he personally answered many of the analysts’ questions.

Forrest Li, founder and group CEO of Sea / Photo credit: Sea

This was notable since the publicity-shy CEO typically does not engage with analysts in these sessions. Chief corporate officer Yanjun Wang usually takes the lead instead.
Asked how the company planned to achieve its GMV target and what gave management the confidence that Shopee could break even in the second half of 2024, Li said Shopee’s position as the “clear market leader” gives it “economic scale” that enables “better monetization capabilities and also better cost efficiencies.”
Better bargaining power
Li said he believed Shopee was “the most price-competitive platform in the market” and that this was a focus management intended to continue.
For example, it would have “slightly better bargaining power” with sellers on how they price their products since they can sell a higher volume of items on Shopee compared to on other marketplaces.
Li also highlighted Shopee’s new “return on-the-spot” service that was introduced in February, through which buyers can return a product at any time during the shipping process. Shopee is the only platform offering such a service, Li claimed.
Buyers will certainly appreciate the lower prices and differentiated services. However, Shopee will have to be careful not to alienate sellers in the process. Some people, claiming to be sellers, have voiced concerns over the new return policy, saying they received returned products in poor condition.
While the ecommerce firm may be the market leader in Indonesia for now, the TikTok Shop and Tokopedia combination will provide a compelling alternative for sellers. Questions remain, though, on whether the entity complies with Indonesian regulations against ecommerce transactions that occur on social media platforms.
Shopee’s ability to allow on-the-spot returns is possible because of its in-house logistics service Shopee Xpress, which it first introduced in 2020.
The move to invest in logistics is a strategy that many ecommerce market leaders are taking. Amazon and South Korea’s Coupang, for instance, have invested heavily in their logistics network.
In his opening remarks during the earnings call, Li touted the progress the company had made in developing its logistics network. In the last quarter of 2023, Shopee opened five new sorting centers and 385 new first- and last-mile hubs across its Asian markets.
He said that overall platform logistics costs per order in Asia declined by 12% year on year in Q4, driven by a 20% decline in Shopee’s own logistics network cost per order. Deliveries were also quicker, with more than half of orders from buyers in Java – home to a large proportion of Indonesia’s population – being delivered within two days.
Yet, the progress that Shopee Xpress has made also brings its own set of problems.

When an ecommerce platform has its own logistics arm but still uses external providers, there tends to be incentives to favor the in-house service, and that will be something Shopee has to balance as it grows Shopee Xpress further.
Indeed, the Indonesian Competition Commission is currently investigating allegations that Shopee automatically directs users to use Shopee Xpress and other affiliated shipping companies for deliveries.
No buybacks for now
With many US-listed tech companies, including Grab, announcing share buybacks as a way to return excess cash to shareholders, Sea’s investors may be wondering the same.
Sea announced that it ended the year with over US$8 billion in cash, short-term investments, and other relatively liquid securities such as bonds.
But investors shouldn’t expect any buybacks for now. Asked about whether it intended to allocate some of its reserves to buybacks, chief corporate officer Wang replied that the company thought it “prudent to maintain a strong cash balance” to “capture future opportunities to maximize long-term shareholder return.” That said, she did not rule out the possibility of share buybacks in the future.
The market’s enthusiastic reaction to Sea’s results, compared to its muted response to Grab’s, suggests that investors are prioritizing growth over the return of capital at this point. This was one of the reasons for the stock market’s disappointing reaction to Grab’s Q4 results – its 2024 revenue guidance fell below expectations.
Now, Sea has to deliver on its commitments. Markets and investors are fickle and demanding. Should the company fall short of its guidance, this is likely to provoke a sell-off in its shares, which have had a good run and are currently up 54% for the year.","Sea ended the year with over US$8 billion in cash, short-term investments, and other liquid securities.",Simon Huang,Editing by Melissa Goh and Jaclyn Tiu,open,1,,https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/shopee-office-scaled.jpeg,false,"",false,true,true,true,false,6,,1427,"Sea’s upbeat outlook on Shopee drives enthusiasm, but can it deliver?","Sea ended the year with over US$8 billion in cash, short-term investments, and other liquid securities.",,,"","",""

The numbers aren’t pretty.
Last month, Japan and the UK slipped into a recession. The US, the world’s largest economy, is predicted to follow suit and a further slowdown is expected in China.
Offering a ray of hope for frantic founders is Olivier Raussin, co-founder and managing partner of entrepreneur-driven VC firm Febe Ventures. He tells Tech in Asia that he once went through the same dilemma, but he managed to survive – and even steer Brazilian wine startup Evino back to growth.

“I speak from personal experience when I say it can be done. After many painful decisions and lessons, my previous company didn’t just survive. It managed to completely turn around and found a path to healthy growth,” says Raussin.
Founded in 2019, Febe Ventures – short for “For Entrepreneurs, By Entrepreneurs” – was joined by other entrepreneurs-turned-investors: Aditya Pendyala, co-founder of IoT firm Mnubo; Nicolas El Baze, a serial entrepreneur and partner at investment firm Partech; and Jai Choi, co-founder of cloud-based search web service PeerPong and managing partner of VC firm Tekton Ventures.
They have a combined history of building over 30 companies and backing over 200 startups.
“We’re operators at heart, so we understand the good, the bad, and the ugly of the startup journey and try to give founders what we wish we had: hassle-free processes, no-nonsense feedback, and hard-earned lessons from past experiences – both failures and successes,” says Raussin.

At the end of 2023, Febe Ventures launched its second fund with a goal of raising US$75 million. It had already secured capital commitments totaling 90% of the target at the time.
The company raised US$25 million in its first fund to invest in 34 companies, a large majority of which were in the pre-seed and seed stages. Within Febe’s portfolio, 50% are SaaS or software companies, 82% are B2B-focused, and 40% have a global reach.
In a Q&amp;A with Tech in Asia, Raussin shares his plans about Febe’s second fund and what founders need to focus on to revive their startups. Below is our conversation, which has been edited for clarity and brevity:
What advice would you give such founders on a short runway in this economic climate?
Raussin: The high-level advice is the same for all companies: Enter survival mode; aim for healthy unit economics and a sustainable profit and loss statement.
The specifics will vary by company, but [the solution] involves more than just layoffs. It’s about reworking economic models, maximizing pricing levers, cutting off unhealthy customers, eliminating non-essential expenses, and reducing all organizational complexity.
It’s easier said than done, but I speak from personal experience when I say it can be done.
What are some of the mistakes you made as a startup founder that other founders should avoid?
I made countless mistakes as a founder and operator. These include being slow in iterating and releasing products, and trying to scale too early before finding proper product-market fit.
I’ve also built on false assumptions rather than following the iterative process of minimum viable product development. For instance, I didn’t consult enough customers to thoroughly understand their issues and needs, and therefore I developed solutions that were not enough for them.
In hindsight, I should have rather done a smaller iterative process to maximize customers satisfaction and engagement.
What are the sectors and geographies Fund II will target?
While we’re open to various sectors, we have a keen interest in B2B software, marketplace, health, and sustainability startups. Geographically, our focus is on emerging markets, tapping into our extensive networks in Southeast Asia, North America, Latin America, and Europe.
Our average investment will be around US$250,000 for pre-seed and US$750,000 for seed-stage companies. We have also reserved significant amounts for follow-on investments.

How much from Fund II will be invested in Southeast Asia?
Southeast Asia will still be our main focus for Fund II, as it’s where our roots lie. Aditya [co-founder of IoT firm Mnubo] is based in Indonesia, much of our team is in Vietnam, and Nicolas [El Baze] and I have an existing portfolio of over 70 startups in the region.
Additionally, a significant number of our limited partners (investors who contribute capital to VC funds) are from Southeast Asia, hence reinforcing our commitment to this region.
Startups in the sustainability and climate tech space are really nascent and may take years to develop, how do you go about deciding which founders to invest in?
It’s true that many climate innovations require a longer development horizon than the typical VC life cycle allows – which is about eight to 10 years. With this in mind, we seek founders with a clear understanding of the specific problems and use cases they aim to address, ensuring these solutions can be realistically commercialized within the VC timeframe.
For instance, in Fund I, we invested in Botol Recycling, which addresses the data and informational needs of plastic producers. Another investee, Zuno Carbon, tackles enterprise carbon accounting and ESG reporting challenges.
These investments illustrate our commitment to founders who have a clear vision for solving tangible problems within the sustainability sector, aligning with the VC investment horizon.
How do you give founders the support they need without being an overbearing investor?
Each partner at Febe takes a different approach to portfolio support.
I’m a business development and WhatsApp audio guy. I’m available 24/7 on WhatsApp for founders to bounce ideas and brainstorm. I strive to be the first person founders contact for both good and bad news.
Aditya excels in helping founders build a scalable go-to-market engine in the zero-to-one stage, which is when they’re developing an idea into the first version of a product that can be sold. Nicolas leverages four decades of experience as an entrepreneur, investor, and board director.
Together, we adapt our involvement to match the needs of different founders, ensuring our involvement is helpful but not intrusive.","Singapore-based Febe Ventures launched its second fund and plans to invest in B2B software, marketplace, health, and sustainability startups.",Collin Furtado,Editing by Scott Shuey and Dhania Putri Sarahtika,open,1,,https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1709894046_FEBE-team-photo_1.png,false,"",false,true,true,true,false,5,,1060,Founder-focused VC offers hope to startups facing the end,"Singapore-based Febe Ventures launched its second fund and plans to invest in B2B software, marketplace, health, and sustainability startups.",,,"","",""

Hi readers,
For working parents of babies, it is challenging to keep track of essential items at home. I live in India, and my go-to platforms for last-minute needs are quick commerce services like Swiggy’s Genie and BigBasket’s BBNow, which deliver diapers, wet wipes, and other baby staples within a few minutes.
But when it comes to clothing and accessories for my kids, I turn to FirstCry. The abundance of options and affordable prices make it my top choice. Babies grow so rapidly that what fit them perfectly just last week might be too small today. That’s why I find myself browsing and buying baby clothes almost every month on FirstCry.
When I started writing our piece on baby ecommerce, I felt like this was familiar territory… except that I did not know what the scene in Southeast Asia is like. Some research revealed that while baby ecommerce in the region  is growing significantly, it is still a small market compared to India.
This can be attributed to socio-economic, demographic, and operational factors, among others. While companies like Concung and Edamama have gained ground in their respective countries, a dominant platform akin to FirstCry has yet to emerge in the region.
Maybe there will be one on my next visit to Southeast Asia, and its impact will be similar to Grab’s or Shopee’s when they launched.

Hello reader,
Have you ever opened up a data-sheet or work document and immediately did a double take upon seeing a surprising stat or figure?
That happened to me in the process of writing today’s newsletter. The top deal is one for US$1.1 billion – that’s more than most weekly totals.
(I totally squinted and counted the number of zeroes three times to make sure I had the right number.)
Perhaps less surprising is that that deal comes from China – but don’t sleep on the runners-up. It’s a newsletter of big winners today.

Behind the Glasswall

Fundraising often involves reaching out to multiple contacts, many of whom founders might not have dealt with before. To provide some transparency to this process, we created Glasswall, a platform for founders to give feedback and recommendations on investors. Check out the full list here.

✅︎ “The program is intense, and we were challenged (productively) week on week to validate our business idea. We can feel our ideas sharpening over the weeks, and it’s been immensely helpful in clarifying what we’re doing.
After we passed the IC, the money came into our account very quickly.” – Read more

❌ “Handed us over to multiple partners; each handoff required a re-pitch; assoc reached out and demanded a re-pitch despite us having pitched to another partner a week earlier. We did the pitch anyway just to be polite.
Messy internal process and systems, in the end it just petered out as no one knew what was going on.” – Read more

✅︎ “Extremely knowledgeable partners who have built and exited tech companies. They provide practical and actionable insights with frameworks for new founders to adopt, and illustrate these insights with their own experience building their own companies. The knowledge acquired from orientation/retreat and weekly office hours are not the typical “vanilla” topics like term sheets 101, what is product-market-fit, but rather, they are pragmatic and in-depth advice that is catered to each startup. Thumbs up through and through.” – Read more

Thoughtful reads
1️⃣ Can the sustainability sector sustain its success?
This PitchBook article states that climate tech firms, vis-à-vis other verticals, attracted stronger VC interest and maintained their valuations better last year. These companies also outpaced their peers in expanding teams and filing patents.
However, a myriad of challenges (and opportunities!) lie ahead for the sector in 2024. Click in to see what the new year could look like for climate tech.
2️⃣ Jack of all trades
This Masters of Scale episode delves into a few different newsy topics, including how AI is transforming the game of scale and the main driving forces behind the recent tech layoffs.
(No entertaining spiel because I don’t think I have to sell the episode when the synopsis is that compelling.)
3️⃣ Change is inevitable – here’s how to make it work for you
In the startup world, change happens all the time. But precisely because it’s so common, sometimes processes fall through the cracks and new initiatives’ objectives get lost in a cloud of uncertainty or insufficient action.
This piece from Harvard Business Review offers some tips to successfully execute change at the office.
4️⃣ Fit check
More product-market fit tips; this time, it’s from Eddy Lu, the co-founder and CEO of Goat, a platform for sneakers and luxury apparel that houses more than 350 brands, a million sellers, and 50 million members across 170 countries.
Impressive numbers. Let’s see if his advice matches up.
5️⃣ Give the people what they want
You don’t have to be a visionary to be successful – you just have to know what the people really want and give it to them.

“Why do you want to bitch about them? I’m sure everyone’s going through a hard time,” he said.
Times are hard, indeed. More than two years into the tech winter, many founders in the region are grappling with the sobering reality that easy money is drying up.

Is the tech bubble bursting in Southeast Asia? / Image credit: Timmy Loen

The fallout has been particularly acute in the past two years. Data from Tech in Asia’s layoff tracker shows that at least 12,300 employees were axed from tech companies in Southeast Asia between January 2022 and January 2024. The actual number is likely much higher.
A recent report by January Capital and Alternatives.pe found that tech funding in the region dropped to just US$5.5 billion in 2023, a 30% decline from US$8.4 billion in 2022.
Tech in Asia data reveals that at least 21 startups in Southeast Asia attained unicorn status in 2021. Only eight startups achieved this milestone in 2022 while eFishery was the sole addition to the billion-dollar club in 2023.
Despite these figures, the outlook is far from all doom and gloom. The region’s population of 650 million still offers immense potential for tech disruption. Its digital economy was projected to deliver US$100 billion in revenue in 2023.
Still, one might wonder: Where is Southeast Asia’s tech ecosystem headed?
Is the party for cheap capital over?
In a June 2023 investor survey conducted by Preqin, only 31% of respondents viewed Southeast Asia as the most promising venture capital market, down from 48% in 2022 and 46% in 2021.
Meanwhile, sentiment towards India surged and surpassed Southeast Asia.

But does that indicate waning enthusiasm for the region among investors?
Analysis by Dmitry Levit, who leads Cento Ventures’ biannual SEA tech investment report, suggests a slowdown of mega deals in the first half of 2023. Such deals are worth over US$100 million and often financed by global investors.
He attributes this trend primarily to global financial conditions rather than the region’s lack of appeal.
In 2021, the Covid-19 pandemic prompted a surge in tech investment worldwide. “A lot of global VCs said the way to win was to invest more than others. Southeast Asia just caught a little bit of it,” he notes.
Nevertheless, concerns regarding the region’s exit landscape linger within the industry, especially when some mega IPOs have been underperforming.
Bloomberg recently reported that the stocks of super apps Grab and GoTo have plummeted by approximately 70% since their stock market debuts just a few years ago.
Vietnamese automaker VinFast’s stocks are currently trading at US$5.20, representing approximately one-fourth of its debut IPO price of US$22. In January, VNG canceled its much-anticipated US listing.

In the US, stocks of global giants such as Nvidia and Arm continue to climb. Nvidia recently reached a market capitalization of US$2 trillion.
“It won’t be an overnight fix,” says Eric Fang, founding partner of Favour Capital. His firm was the financial advisor to the US$51.5 million series B round of Buymend, a Vietnam-based pharmaceutical marketplace, in May 2023.
“We see hope through the improvement of key infrastructures, such as the growth of local exchanges, better IPO regulations, and cross-border exit opportunities like the TikTok-Tokopedia merger,” Fang noted.
Kevin Lai, co-founder and partner of L2 Capital Management, emphasizes that the absence of notable successful exits may raise concerns among investors focused solely on financial returns in Southeast Asia.
However, Lai believes that “the new wave of investors come with a strategic mindset, hence the value accretion consideration to their businesses outweigh the concern regarding exits.”
More dry powder or drying up?
Satya Nadella, CEO and chairman of Microsoft, is expected to visit several Southeast Asian countries later this month, underscoring the region’s significance to the tech giant’s generative AI initiatives.
It’s unclear if Nadella will make any investment announcements during his visit.

“Investors are not turning away from the region,” says Julian Low of Starstorm Ventures, who used to serve as executive director of investments at Vertex Ventures. “It’s just that the high interest rate environment has made them more risk-averse.”
Low’s startup was acquired by San Francisco-based Zendesk in 2014 for nearly US$30 million. He thinks that Southeast Asia’s ecosystem has come a long way from the time when raising US$1 million was considered “the talk of the town.” Nowadays, such funding can “happen every other Tuesday” even amid the current tech winter.
Indeed, there’s plenty of VC dry powder in Southeast Asia that have yet to be ignited.
Data from Preqin indicates that as of March 2023, ASEAN-focused VC dry powder totaled US$7.4 billion. This exceeds the nearly US$6 billion that the region’s startups raised from seed to series B stages in 2021, when VC funding peaked, according to the January Capital and Alternative.pe report.

Industry sources told Tech in Asia that deal activities could intensify in 2024 as some VC firms may also be waiting for startup valuations to fall further.
Another positive sign is that seed-stage funding continues to be robust in Southeast Asia. January Capital deals data shows that deals in this category are at an all-time high both in terms of volume and dollar value of deals. This may signal optimism that later-stage investors will return to the table.
Greener pastures beyond Southeast Asia?
The next wave of unicorns could adopt a different playbook than earlier batches.
For instance, Indonesia’s eFishery and chiplet specialist Silicon Box – the “fish and chips” of Southeast Asia’s unicorn club, if you will – are taking an early approach to global expansion. Their aggressive strategy stands in contrast to the more regional focus adopted by Grab and GoTo.

EFishery, which claims it has been profitable since 2018, announced its official expansion into India in October 2023.
It is too early to judge the company’s impact in the country, but CEO and co-founder Gibran Huzaifah appears to prioritize sustainable growth over aggressive expansion. For now, eFishery is concentrating on Andhra Pradesh, a state responsible for 35% of India’s aquaculture output.
Low of Starstorm Ventures also believes that Southeast Asian startups aren’t obligated to expand across the region. He pointed out that his previous startup, ZopIM, primarily served customers in the US before it was acquired.
Additionally, although Southeast Asia has approximately 335 million smartphone users, he cautions that the revenue per customer may not be sufficient for certain business models to thrive.
With their high per-capita incomes, markets such as Singapore are more similar to the US than Indonesia. Notably, companies like gaming-chair maker Secretlab and furniture retailer Castlery have successfully penetrated the US market.

Back home, the challenges of scaling across Southeast Asia’s fragmented markets have become more pronounced during market downturns.
For instance, Singapore-based PropertyGuru withdrew from Indonesia in 2023 and recently shuttered some branches in Vietnam as it struggled amid a stagnant local real estate market.

Delivery Hero was unable to offload its Foodpanda unit to Grab as the German tech giant strove to make its food delivery business in Southeast Asia sustainable.
There are greener pastures beyond Southeast Asia for your business model. You just have to go out and find it.
However, Favour Capital’s Fang cautioned against comparing the region with the US and China. “Southeast Asia is characterized by market-led innovation, rather than being innovation-led like the US and China,” he says.
In countries like Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines, innovation often involves adapting technology to existing models as well as local needs and inefficiencies, Fang explained.
Still, Southeast Asian startups focusing on “market-led innovation” should not limit themselves to expanding solely into neighboring countries.
In his keynote address at the 2023 TIA Conference, 500 Global’s Ng lauded eFishery for taking the unconventional step of venturing from Indonesia to India. The global VC firm first invested in eFishery during its series A round in 2018.
“There are greener pastures beyond Southeast Asia for your business model,” he remarked. “You just have to go out and find it.”

Singapore-based TreeDots, an online marketplace that lets users purchase surplus produce at lower prices, has laid off some of its employees, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Tech in Asia.
The job cuts were announced to staff during a town hall meeting on March 1.
The East Ventures-backed company operates in Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia, but it has employees across the world. While both sources said around 20 people were retrenched, TreeDots co-founder Tyler Jong said only 13 out of over 200 employees were dismissed.
The move affected the tech and R&amp;D departments, he added. Out of the 13 employees, 10 were from TreeDots’ Indonesia team. The other three were from teams in Singapore, Myanmar, and India.
Speaking with Tech in Asia, Jong clarified that the cuts came as the company is transitioning its tech team from a group structure to one that is more country-based.
“The reason why we have people laid off in the Indonesia level or other countries is actually the same. Tech is working at a group level at this stage. Moving forward, we change our approach,” he says. TreeDots’ next phase entails experimenting with different things in various markets.
He added that this team structure may change in the future and that the company may rehire for specific parts of the business.
Founded in 2017 by Jong, Nicholas Lim, and Jiacai Lau, TreeDots also provides logistics services, helping companies transport fruit and vegetables, meat, and other food products. Its most recent fundraise was in 2011, securing US$11 million in a series A round co-led by Amasia and East Ventures.
In 2022, TreeDots shut down its B2C group-buying service, citing challenges in synergies with its B2B business.
But by March 2022, the company said it had saved more than 2,500 tonnes of food waste. That year, Singapore generated around 813,000 tonnes of such waste.
TreeDots wants to save up to 2 million tonnes of food waste by 2025.

TikTok may lose access to its largest market worldwide, with the US House of Representatives planning a vote on a bill requiring ByteDance, the short-video platform’s parent company, to sell TikTok within six months or face a ban, Reuters reported.
Lawmakers advanced the bill proposal after a confidential briefing on the national security risks from TikTok’s Chinese ownership.
Meanwhile, TikTok insists it has not and will not share US user information with the Chinese government. The company is also unsure whether China would approve of a sale and if it can be achieved within the six-month timeframe.
Should the bill be approved, it would give ByteDance 165 days to separate from TikTok. Failure to do so would ban app stores like those operated by Apple and Google from hosting TikTok and other ByteDance-owned apps legally.
If the bill is passed, it could set a precedent for handling security concerns over other China-linked apps. When asked if the bill would affect messaging platform WeChat, Mike Gallagher – a member of the US House of Representatives and the head of its select China committee – said that “going forward, we can debate what companies” the bill can apply to.
This isn’t the first time the US government has made efforts to ban TikTok. In 2020, former president Donald Trump tried to ban both TikTok and WeChat in the country.

Hello reader,
Happy International Women’s Day!
Every year, Tech in Asia’s International Women’s Day campaign is led by none other than my colleague Stefanie Yeo. She’s always been a fantastic project leader, and I’m continually impressed by how much she can get done. (I mean she’s disciplined enough to go for 8 am runs basically every day – I could never.)
For this year’s campaign, we came up with a whole slate of exciting and interesting content, including a deeply personal piece by our COO Maria Li and a mini mockumentary series, which you can find on our social media pages.
Today’s premium story – a fantastic and in-depth diagram of all the female founders and leaders in Southeast Asia’s biggest startups – is part of this year’s campaign too. It’s a really good showcase of just how critical everyone is in our regional tech scene.
At the risk of coming off like I’m virtue signaling, here’s a quick shout out to all the women out there who keep the world going round.
Today we look at:

The women calling the shots in Southeast Asia’s tech scene
A carbon project startup’s seed round
Other newsy highlights such as JD.com’s fourth quarter results and Bukalapak halting its buy now, pay later offering

It’s raining women

Hallelujah, because without these women, who knows where some of the startups on this list would be? Here’s a look at some of the women that work tirelessly behind (and in front of) the scenes at major companies like GoTo to Lazada.


Fantastic Four: Lazada, which tops this list for most funding in the last two years, has four major female leaders: chief people officer Lillian Jang, group counsel and ESG leader Gladys Chun, chief customer officer Brigitte Daubry, and group COO Kaya Qin, who is also CEO of Lazada Vietnam. 

At the apex: We’ve got several CEOs on the list, including: Insider co-founder Hande Cilingir, Su Mei Toh of Anext Bank, and more. 

The more the merrier: Several companies have three or more women in top leadership positions, namely Lazada, Insider, Tyme, TNG Digital, Astro, and Anext Bank.

Startup spotlight
A thriving company

Yet another startup that’s become a victim of “vowel replacealitis” – where founders  change or remove vowels in the name of their firm – is Thryve.Earth. All jokes aside, though, the company has reason to celebrate: It’s recently raised US$2.6 million in a seed funding round.
Let’s see what it’s up to.


The core business: The Singapore-based startup is a carbon project developer that uses a tech stack to assess, design, and implement its projects. 

Planting new capabilities: Thryve said that the new funds will help the construction of tools to de-risk and streamline project assessment, as well as design and implement carbon initiatives.

Across the globe: Additionally, the fresh funds will enable the company to grow its team and expand into other markets in Asia and Latin America.

Ryde has started trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) with the ticker “RYDE,” marking the first time a Singaporean ride-hailing company has debuted on the NYSE.
Its stock debut price was US$4 per share, which shifted between US$4.2 and US$4.6 in its second trading day.
The company raised a total of US$12 million in gross proceeds, though it previously aimed to secure US$17 million through the IPO. Terence Zou, Ryde’s CEO, said that the firm plans to use the proceeds to expand globally and upgrade its tech.
Founded in 2014, Ryde is one of the few companies with a full ride-hailing license in Singapore, joining the likes of ComfortDelGro, Grab, Gojek, and Tada Mobility.
Ryde’s revenue for 2022 grew 42% year on year, while its pre-income tax losses widened from 20% of revenue in 2021 to 56% of revenue in 2022.
It last raised funding as a private company in April 2023, securing around US$2 million from family office Octava.

Now operating at a profitable level, Razer‘s fintech arm is getting a new look and feel – rebranding from Razer Fintech to Fiuu.
This move marks a pivot toward independence and a sharper focus on the digital payment sector, the company said in a statement. It would help Fiuu inch away from the gaming-focused reputation that the name Razer would imply.
The rebrand follows the company’s recent partnership with Philippines-based buy now, pay later firm BillEase.
Fiuu will also see changes to its leadership. Lee Li Meng will become the firm’s executive chairman, with Eng Sheng Guan taking over as CEO. Eng previously served as the executive director of Razer Merchant Services, Fiuu’s B2B payments unit.
Razer said that under Lee, Fiuu has generated “exceptional growth,” with revenue doubling over the past four years. The company also said that the fintech firm recorded more than US$6.6 billion in total payment volume for the 2023 financial year.

“I believe, therefore I can,” the old adage says – and it’s a mentality that is said to be lacking in women and creating the gender wage gap. 
The dominant narrative frames the gap as a result of women’s lack of confidence compared to men when it comes to pursuing higher paying roles and salaries.
The commonly suggested antidote has been that once we boost women’s relevant skill and education levels (such as bringing more women into STEM roles), and relatedly their confidence levels, the pay gap would solve itself.
So why does the gender wage gap stubbornly remain, even when women have comparable education, skills and work experience? 
Research suggests that the opposite narrative might be true: The pay gap does not stem from a self-esteem issue but a systemic one. 
As the graphs above show:

The wage gap stubbornly persists despite equalizing confidence-related factors.

Another significant pattern is that wages decrease whenever female concentration rises, across multiple industries. There is evidence that suggests this is caused in part by the perception that women’s entry into an occupation causes declines in its prestige.

We also see that the income gap can have a significant impact on a person’s mental health and confidence. 

While the data doesn’t rule out the possibility of confidence affecting the wage gap, we can’t deny that systemic factors beyond an individual’s confidence and even competence levels are a primary driver. 
To understand this is a huge deal. 
It allows one to re-evaluate objectively when they feel a lack of confidence, and acknowledge that what they feel may not signal a problem or lack within themselves but a systemic one, which they can then change with the right approach.

While the original statement is usually used in an investing context, it brings up a pertinent question in general: If a layperson feels confident enough to give “expert” advice, can that topic still be considered cutting-edge?
Take AI, for instance. The industry has blazed a trail through 2023 following the surge of sub-verticals like genAI. Now, it seems like almost everyone has something to say about what the tech should be doing and how critical it’s going to be in the coming years.

Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI / Photo credit: Y Combinator

As such, almost every stakeholder in the tech sector will be wondering if AI is something worth devoting resources to. How can they sort through all the noise to figure out what’s worth listening to?
That’s where SuperAI comes in. Hosted by the organizers of global Web3 conference series Token2049, the event will bring together key opinion leaders to share their perspectives on the sector.
The following interview with Alex Fiskum, co-founder of SuperAI, has been edited for clarity and brevity.
What are your thoughts on how quickly AI has risen to prominence over the last year?
Across industries such as financial services, biotech, and education, the recent leap in AI is opening up new frontiers of innovation and applications. I believe that it’s a true game changer that has fuelled unprecedented interest, investment, and opportunities – all of which is culminating in the next wave of AI disruption, which we’re hoping to unveil at SuperAI.
Please provide an overview of what SuperAI will be about
SuperAI will be held in Singapore from June 5 to 6 this year.

It’s a new conference series dedicated to the AI industry and aims to be a milestone event in the realm of tech innovation. Attendees will get to connect with and hear from renowned thought leaders and industry experts who will exchange insights on the current state and future trajectory of AI, exploring its impact across geographies and business sectors.
Who is the target audience and why should they attend SuperAI?
SuperAI is a platform for people from all walks of life – including industry leaders, heads of state, entrepreneurs, renowned researchers, and curious minds, regardless of whether they’re early-stage pioneers or established leaders. We believe that all of them are eager to showcase and explore the transformative potential of AI.
Additionally, we’re confident that the event is something that interests people across the world, given that international registrations make up over 60% of our total participants so far.
Who will be speaking at the event?

Headline speakers include Edward Snowden, known for his whistleblowing efforts in 2013; angel investor and former CTO of Coinbase Balaji Srinivasan; Benedict Evans, independent analyst and former partner at Andreessen Horowitz; Raoul Pal, co-founder and CEO of Real Vision; Sophia, the humanoid robot from Hanson Robotics; and Ben Goertzel, founder and CEO of Singularity Net.
We’re looking to unveil more than 150 additional speakers in the months leading up to the event.
What was the selection process like and how did you end up with this lineup?
Our selection process was simple: To include diverse perspectives from the most influential and established opinion leaders in the AI ecosystem. All speakers possess demonstrated expertise and acumen at the forefront of their fields. This will offer SuperAI attendees a comprehensive range of insights that will showcase how AI will continue to change the world.
What are some topics for the event that you’d like to highlight and why did you select them for discussion?
The top few that come to mind are large language models, genAI, robotics, decentralized AI, and the intersection of AI with Web3.
Apart from those topics, we’re also going to be looking at the integration of AI into fintech, healthcare, and cybersecurity, as well as its impact on the future of work. Moving forward, it will be crucial to bridge accessibility and education gaps to level the playing field.
How can this event help improve Asia’s AI ecosystem?
There will be panels, presentations, live demos, and exclusive networking sessions, which will offer illuminating insights from the world’s foremost AI innovators, evoking inspiration and excitement on what’s ahead for the industry at large.

Sunday CEO Cindy Kua / Photo credit: Sunday

Singapore-registered Sunday Ins Holdings, the holding firm for Thai insurtech firm Sunday, is strengthening its position in Southeast Asia with the acquisition of a 99% stake in KSK Insurance Indonesia.
The acquired firm offers car, property, and cargo policies with a strong presence in key Indonesian regions, including Jabodetabek, Bandung, Surabaya, Medan, and Bali.
With the acquisition, KSK Insurance will gain access to Sunday’s tech, including its AI-powered risk assessment platform. The deal will also help Sunday broaden its distribution reach in the archipelago’s insurance market.
The deal took place in January, following approval from Otoritas Jasa Keuangan, Indonesia’s financial services authority. 
There were reports last year saying that Sunday was mulling an IPO in New York. However, Ryuji Wolf, group CFO of Sunday, told Tech in Asia in a previous interview that a financial debut may be a few more years away for the company.
However, the executive added that regional expansion was in the cards for the company – with markets like Vietnam and the Philippines as potential targets.
Sunday first launched in Indonesia as a registered insurtech firm and licensed broker in 2022. It operates as a full-stack carrier, which means that in addition to distribution and claims, it also underwrites the policies it sells.

Photo Credit: Rukita

Like in many other industries, proptech firms are pivoting their strategies to focus on profitability as VC investments become harder to find. For Indonesia-based Rukita, profitability came after being in operation for four years
Founded in 2019, Rukita offers affordable rental options catered to the archipelago’s burgeoning middle class and millennials.
Now, the company said it has turned EBITDA positive, currently managing over 1.4 million rooms with more than 3 million unique users a month visiting its platform.
Now it has secured US$15 million in a series B1 funding round to further drive its growth. New investors in the company include MPower Partners, BNI Ventures, and Openspace Ventures.
Rukita – which was part of the second cohort of Surge, Peak XV’s accelerator program – aims to use the fresh capital to continue developing its tech, expand its services, and attract top new talent, among other initiatives.
In March 2022, Rukita acquired room rental marketplace Infokost. The acquired firm was previously owned by GDP Ventures, the investment arm of Indonesian conglomerate Djarum Group.
Rukita isn’t the only one making moves in Indonesia’s proptech ecosystem. In December 2023, Bank BTN and Mandiri Capital Indonesia (MCI) launched the BTN Fund, poised to invest in a wide range of property-related technologies including proptech, mortgage tech, and construction tech.

After a productive start to its 2024 financial year, Singapore-headquartered Carro has acquired Hong Kong-based Beyond Cars, a used-car platform.
This marks Carro’s latest market entry, adding to its presence in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Japan, and Taiwan.
Following the acquisition, Beyond Cars CEO Garry Yu and COO Luke Yip will maintain their leadership roles within the Hong Kong business. Carro also looks to develop insurtech, financing, and aftersales services for its operations in the city.
Founded in 2016, Beyond Cars offers end-to-end vehicle transaction services such as consignment, financing, and insurance. The company has been profitable for three years and is projected to see a compound annual growth rate of over 50% in the next three years.
Recently, Carro’s Malaysian unit MyTukar confirmed it was eyeing a license that would allow it to conduct commercial vehicle inspection and transfer of vehicle ownership services in the country.
Carsome, one of Carro’s biggest competitors in the used car space, is also reportedly looking to acquire the same license.

We break down the big and messy topics of Asia’s tech and startup community. Get the newsletter in your inbox everyday with a premium subscription.
Hello reader,
I’m a firm believer in pursuing different areas of interest. For example, I might read and write a lot about tech because it’s part of my job, but I also like sports, video games, and history.
I’ve found that at the macro level, there are actually many similarities between these disparate fields. The rise and fall of tech firms mirrors that of basketball teams and imperial dynasties, for example. Alternatively, some of the most memorable video game stories take inspiration from myths and historical events.
Reading widely can help people see patterns and get a feel for the ebbs and flows of life, methinks. Not that it will allow us to predict the future to a T, but knowing that lean periods often follow abundant seasons keeps us humble and focused. And knowing that good times will come after bad can provide some much-needed comfort.
For Sea Group, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster recently, with both highs and lows. Today’s premium piece looks at the Southeast Asian tech major’s key financials over the last few years.
Today we look at:

Sea’s financial situation, in graphic form
Why Alibaba is investing even more money into AI
Other newsy highlights such as Temasek’s reported interest in backing OpenAI and application season for virtual banking licenses in Thailand


Premium summary
Be aware and adjust accordingly

Image credit: Timmy Loen

If being managing editor of Tech in Asia Studios has taught me anything, it’s the value of being flexible enough to pivot on short notice over planning out everything 100%. Circumstances change all the time in the startup world, and getting too stuck on a course of action is tantamount to setting yourself up to fail.
That looks like what Sea Group is doing. While its numbers don’t look as amazing as they did when the firm could afford to hire football star Cristiano Ronaldo for a (cringe-tastic) ad, changes are afoot to secure its future.


Dipping, but for a reason: The firm’s cash and cash equivalents have been steadily plummeting since Q3 2021. However, this is because it’s putting a lot of money into short-term and liquid investments to earn interest.

Not as entertaining: Its digital entertainment division, led by gaming arm Garena, used to be Sea’s unassailable source of revenue, but that has seen a decline over the past couple years.

A pivot on the cards? On the bright side, revenue from Sea’s digital financial services has been growing. Is this the company’s next cash cow?

Startup spotlight
Big money from Alibaba for this AI startup

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Soon after pumping money into Moonshot AI, Alibaba has led an over US$600 million funding round for Chinese startup MiniMax.
Going all in on AI, huh?


Big money, big money: The deal brought MiniMax’s valuation to over US$2.5 billion.

What it do, baby: MiniMax specializes in social AI, developing AI companions and virtual characters for interactive experiences.

An ecosystem play: Alibaba is also trying to integrate AI – including its in-house model Tongyi Qianwen – across its diverse operations, which include entertainment.

1️⃣ Temasek x OpenAI
Temasek Holdings appears to be putting money where the money already is. The Singapore-based investment firm reportedly in early-stage talks with OpenAI. Should the deal materialize, Temasek would be the ChatGPT developer’s first state-backed investor.
Tech in Asia reached out to Temasek to ask about the deal, but it declined to comment “on market speculations.” OpenAI has yet to respond to our request.
2️⃣ Sawadee krub, virtual banking
Thailand’s Finance Ministry said the country is opening applications for virtual bank permits for the next six months, Reuters reported.
The move is aimed at extending financial services to those who lack or have limited access to banks. Half of Thailand’s population has no access to financial products, while 18% remains underbanked, according to a report from financial services firm Macquarie in May 2022.

Fashion ecommerce firm Pomelo Fashion posted a 34% year-on-year revenue jump for 2022, according to its financial statements obtained from Alternatives.pe, which tracks regulatory filings in Singapore.
The Thailand-based firm’s revenue amounted to US$38 million, while its losses narrowed by 5% to US$31.9 million in 2022.
Such results indicate that the company remained strong even as offline activities were gradually resuming at the time – and that Pomelo had been able to stand toe to toe with the likes of Shein.
Despite the revenue boost and reduced losses, Pomelo’s total expenses rose 13% to US$70.5 million in the period. Most of these expenses were contributed by inventories, employee benefits, and marketing costs.
Without going into specifics, CEO and co-founder David Jou told Tech in Asia that Pomelo made “significant bottom-line improvements” in 2023 while narrowing its losses by over 65%.
In 2022, Pomelo laid off 55 of its staff – or around 8% of its headcount – in an effort to get the company on track for “more sustainable growth.”
Market-wise, around 80% of Pomelo’s revenue in 2022 came from its core market of Thailand. Sales in the country had a 61% increase compared to the previous year.
However, a different situation was found in its other markets. In Singapore, the company’s revenue barely increased – from US$3.7 million to US$3.8 million. There were also declines in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.
Meanwhile, the company managed to reduce cash used in operating activities by 26% in the period.
Pomelo was reportedly eyeing an IPO in 2022, but the plan has yet to materialize. Founded in 2013, the firm has raised a total of US$125 million in disclosed funding, according to the Tech in Asia database.

Governments across the globe are taking an increasingly proactive approach toward regulating AI, and Indonesia is following suit. Nezar Patria, the deputy minister of communication and information, told  Tech in Asia Indonesia that his ministry is preparing more comprehensive AI regulations, which it looks to launch by the end of 2024.
However, it’s currently unclear whether Indonesia is also setting up a national investment fund akin to neighboring Singapore’s. According to the ministry of communication and information, the regulations will primarily set out sanctions targeting AI misuse.
Those sanctions relate to existing laws, including those on personal data protection, copyright, as well as electronic information and transactions. Patria added that the ministry plans to work with UNESCO to ensure adherence with global standards.
The announcement comes a month after ASEAN launched its own AI governance framework, which seeks to establish “common principles” and “best practices” for trustworthy AI solutions among its 10-member bloc.
Budi Arie Setiadi, Indonesia’s minister of communication and information, previously issued a circular letter in December 2023 containing guidelines around AI ethics. The country’s national innovation research agency had also released a national AI strategy in August 2020.
Meanwhile, OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman received Indonesia’s first golden visa last year, ostensibly to help advance the country’s AI ambitions.
That said, it is Singapore – armed with a US$742 million investment – that is fast becoming Southeast Asia’s AI leader. According to nonprofit organization AI Singapore, its large language model (LLM) Sea-Lion is the first open-source LLM specifically focused on Southeast Asian languages and contexts.

Dear readers,
I’m willing to bet US$100 that you’re preoccupied with something: growth.
We all want growth, whether in our careers, our character, our team goals, or our bitcoin holdings. Numbers going up beats numbers going down.
Personally, I’ve been focusing on one thing: growing Tech in Asia’s subscriber base by making a more compelling product.
Since our buyout by SPH Media, we’ve pumped out more impactful investigative stories, released Glasswall, and given our subscribers access to exclusive stories from The Business Times.
We’re not stopping there. I’d like to introduce a new product we’re testing: subscriber-only meetups.
For one evening, we’ll soak ourselves in a bit of Silicon Valley history: joining us in a fireside chat is none other than Sean Ellis, the man who coined the term “growth hacking.”
You can check out the details and RSVP here to the event, which will be held in Singapore.
Core subscribers can join the meetup at no extra charge, but there’s a one-off ticket price for non-subscribers.
Sean, of course, didn’t just coin the phrase. He’s one of its leading promoters and practitioners, having helped familiar brand names like Dropbox and Eventbrite propel into viral growth.
I’ll be moderating the fireside chat. If growth is something you’re preoccupied with, do join us for this. We’ll be sure to dive deeper into growth-hacking best practices, frameworks, and tactics.
To prepare for this, I’ve picked up his book, Hacking Growth. It recounts the unconventional tactics that well-known startups have adopted to hit exponential growth.
For example, Airbnb found a way to drive huge traffic to its site by automatically cross-posting its listings onto Craigslist. The latter soon shut this “integration” down, but it didn’t matter: Airbnb had already gathered momentum.
We’ll talk about these fascinating stories and more in the fireside chat. I’ll allocate plenty of time for audience questions too – so do come prepared as well.

Hi there,
I’ve been learning a lot about postpartum care and things like when to start a baby on solids from a friend who’s a certified nutrition consultant for moms and babies.
In the past year, she’s created an online community for time-starved moms juggling the demands of raising a child and managing work and their households. She dishes out tips around managing recovery after pregnancy, restarting fitness journeys, and caring for babies, which has led to the community’s growth.
I’m not a parent, but I can only imagine what a dizzying journey it is – riding the highs of watching a little human grow, punctured with anxiety, stress, and exhaustion.
With all that parents have to juggle, it’s no wonder the mom and babycare sector in Southeast Asia is booming. It’s expected to be valued between US$26 billion and US$29 billion by 2027, my colleague Samreen writes in this week’s Big Story.
Still, that’s less than half of India’s babycare sector, where players like FirstCry, soon to IPO, sell a range of home-branded products – which include apparel, diapers, feeding and nursing items, as well as toys – both online and in its over 900 stores in the country.
Competition from strong horizontal ecommerce marketplaces like Shopee and Lazada, the operational challenges of scaling across different markets, and limited capital vis-a-vis their India-based counterparts, are just some of the limitations that Southeast Asian babycare players face.
Mom and babycare platforms aren’t the only ones facing challenges. In this week’s Hot Take, I look at cashback and rewards platform ShopBack’s retreat from the buy now, pay later space and discuss why – despite what the move suggests – we likely aren’t seeing the end of BNPL just yet.

THE HOT TAKE
ShopBack discontinues BNPL service, but is it any surprise?

Photo credit: ShopBack

Here’s what happened:

Last week, Singapore-headquartered ShopBack announced that it will be discontinuing its BNPL service, PayLater, from March 22.
The Temasek-backed cashback platform said the move to shut the service was part of a periodic review of its business units.
PayLater will also be discontinued in Malaysia.

Here’s our take:
In just over three years since I first covered the emerging BNPL trend, the fever pitch that spurred the emergence of new entrants and numerous M&amp;As in Singapore is losing its legs.
Like ShopBack, platforms such as Grab and Fave launched pay-later features to complement their offerings. Fave discontinued its BNPL service in September 2022, however.
For ShopBack, its PayLater product – which it acquired as part of the Hoolah deal – was a short-lived endeavor, lasting under two years.
PayLater was meant to add a payments layer – and potential revenue stream – on top of ShopBack’s existing ecommerce offerings, which include cashback, deals, and vouchers to shoppers both online and at physical retail stores.
The BNPL service would have given ShopBack a chance to capture a shopper’s end-to-end journey from discovery and shopping to payments, instead of channeling it to a third-party brand’s site to complete the transaction.
In theory, if ShopBack could convince the over 8,000 brands it works with to adopt BNPL on top of its cashback offering, it could drive increased sales for both the brand and itself. Merchants that offered PayLater as a payment option saw a 20% increase in average basket size, the firm previously said.

PayLater likely struggled for the same reasons that many other BNPL firms did: rising interest rates, slowing ecommerce growth, and intensified competition squeezing margins.
In an already saturated market like Singapore, expanding the pie could entail targeting less creditworthy customers and lead to a rise in bad debt down the line.
Managing delinquencies at scale in a rising interest-rate environment will squeeze margins even further, notes Dylan Tan, co-founder and CEO of now-defunct BNPL service Split.
In its financial year ending March 2023, ShopBack posted a 20% year-on-year decline in revenue. Income from the sale of vouchers fell by more than 50% over the same period.
Its BNPL business posted a revenue of US$3.4 million for FY 2023 – less than 4% of total revenue. That said, ShopBack launched PayLater in July 2022 and was not available for the full 12 months of the period.
To many skeptics, ShopBack’s closure of PayLater doesn’t come as a surprise and is in line with a trend of hard times falling on BNPL firms.
Still, it’s unlikely that we’ve seen the end of BNPL just yet.
In the six months ending December 2023, Australia-based Zip reported positive cash earnings of A$30.8 million (US$20.1 million), driven by transaction volume growth in the US and improved credit losses in its core markets.
Transaction volumes grew 9.6% to A$5 billion (US$3.3 billion) year on year, while bad debts remained under control at 1.9% of sales.
Zip has managed to stay afloat by paring back growth in Europe and the Middle East, levying more merchant or customer fees where required and making cost improvements, laying off up to 20% of its staff. In 2022, the firm had also raised A$200 million (US$130 million), giving it some buffer to tide itself through the storm.
Surviving BNPL firms now stand to benefit from the decreased competition. “The BNPL players that are left will have the advantage of being able to operate in a significantly more rational market. We might not see astronomical growth, but we are seeing profitable growth,” Tobias Yao, portfolio manager at Wilson Asset Management, told the Australian Financial Review.

The East Ventures-backed company’s revenue reached US$8.9 million in the 15-month period between January 2022 and March 2023 (FYE 2023). This is a sharp increase from its earnings of just US$14,800 for 2021, according to Alternatives.pe, which tracks regulatory filings in Singapore.
At the same time, Qapita’s total costs stood at US$14 million in FYE 2023, an over 10x surge compared to 2021. This led to a post-tax operational net loss of US$5.4 million for the most recent period.

Led by Ravi Ravulaparthi, who founded the company in 2019 along with Lakshman Gupta Kanamarlapudi and Vamsee Mohan Kamabathula, Qapita provides capitalization table and employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) management services, with clients from over 40 countries. It also has offices in India and Indonesia.
Speaking with Tech in Asia, Ravulaparthi says much of the company’s revenue comes from its equity management services, comprising 80% in the 2023 calendar year. The rest comes from its marketplace, which facilitates transactions in private market securities.
He adds that the revenue growth in FYE 2023 was a result of the company becoming a market leader in India, with 45% of unicorns in the country using Qapita’s products.

The ESOP Direct takeover
Qapita competes with both regional and global players, including Mumbai-based Trica and Australia-based Cake Equity.
In July 2022, Qapita acquired Indian stock plan management firm ESOP Direct, allowing the former to scale significantly. This has translated into the Singapore-based startup’s top-line growth.
“Before the acquisition, we were very small,” says Ravulaparthi. “The acquisition also helps us in terms of fighting competition in the Indian market.”
The combined entity of Qapita and ESOP Direct has over US$12 billion in employee equity under management, reaching 130,000 employee owners.
See also: Digital wealth platforms report growing AUM, but have yet to see profits
Given that ESOP Direct primarily serves listed companies, the acquisition allowed Qapita to oversee capitalization tables and ESOPs across the spectrum, from early-stage startups to post-IPO enterprises.
To date, Qapita has served more than 1,900 private companies and over 100 listed firms, surging from the 1,200 customers it reached after the ESOP Direct purchase. Among its clients are Singapore-based MSME lender Funding Societies, Indonesian healthtech platform Halodoc, and Indian grocery delivery app Zepto.
Moreover, Qapita’s LinkedIn page says the firm has 324 employees. Following the ESOP Direct deal, its headcount was at around 220.
On its balance sheet, Qapita recorded goodwill on consolidation amounting to US$17.9 million, likely associated with the acquisition.
Profitable by March 2025
As of March 2023, Qapita had a cash reserve of US$13 million, in contrast to the US$1.8 million worth of cash used in operations.

The company had raised funding in 2022 just before the ESOP Direct acquisition, says Ravulaparthi.
According to data from Singapore’s Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority, Qapita recently raised US$17.2 million in pre-series B funding from investors such as East Ventures, MassMutual Ventures, and Cercano Management.
However, Ravulaparthi clarifies that almost all of the amount for this round came before the ESOP Direct acquisition in the form of convertible notes, which were converted into equity in 2024. Part of the 2022 funding was used for the ESOP Direct deal.
The CEO is confident that Qapita doesn’t need to raise more money to be profitable – a milestone it looks to achieve by March 2025.

The company said it’s tapping into the private securities market in Southeast Asia, which could potentially be worth up to US$1.5 trillion in the next five years.
Ravulaparthi tells Tech in Asia that Qapita is also expanding to the US, where it already has a few companies on its platform.
In a 2023 interview with Singapore-based insights and solutions firm HRTech, Ravulaparthi highlighted Qapita’s relevance in an era where people are less inclined to remain in one job for an extended period.
Positioning itself as an HR tech support firm, he said that Qapita helps businesses remain “attractive” by incentivizing employees through ESOPs, the process of which can be “complex and time-consuming, especially for smaller companies.”","The Singapore-based equity management platform aims to be profitable by March 2025, CEO Ravi Ravulaparthi tells Tech in Asia.",Gabriel Budi Sutrisno,Editing by Simon Huang and Lorenzo Kyle Subido,open,2,,https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/1658838394_From-L-to-R-Vamsee-Mohan-Ravi-Ravulaparthi-Lakshman-Gupta.jpg,false,"",false,true,true,true,false,3,,709,Qapita’s revenue jumps to $8.9m in FYE March 2023,"The Singapore-based equity management platform aims to be profitable by March 2025, CEO Ravi Ravulaparthi tells Tech in Asia.",,,"","",""

Corporate gifting appears to be an under-the-radar but potentially lucrative space. A smattering of startups from countries such as the US and Vietnam are helping companies provide tokens of appreciation – whether to customers, employees, or other partners – through tech-enabled solutions.
Another Southeast Asian player in the space is Untukmu AI, whose founder Pang Xue Kai previously co-founded and led Indonesian crypto app Tokocrypto. As its name suggests, Untukmu AI uses AI functions to help corporations and individuals find personalized gifts from the vendors listed on its platform.
The company has raised an undisclosed amount of seed funding led by 1982 Ventures and several angel investors. While based in Singapore, the company is focused on the Indonesian market.
Pang, who also serves as the company’s CEO, founded Untukmu (meaning “for you” in Bahasa Indonesia) last year alongside Pang Xue Cong. Aside from its main features, customers can also use tools such as a gift tracker, a budget tracker, and an events calendar – all integrated with social media to streamline the gifting process.
In a statement, the company claimed that Indonesia’s personal gifting is worth US$20 billion. Since launching its app in January 2024, Untukmu has garnered over 10,000 registered users on its platform, the company added.
With the fresh funds, it aims to expand into healthcare, travel, financial, and lifestyle industries, while also using blockchain and crypto tokens to reward users.
Pang Xue Kai co-founded Tokocrypto in 2018 before stepping down in late 2022, after the company was fully acquired by Binance.

839750,2024-03-07T05:00:10,2024-03-12T15:24:55,Speed bumps ahead as Malaysian state investors grapple with startup funding,speed-bumps-ahead-malaysian-stateowned-investors-grapple-startup-funding,publish,post,https://www.techinasia.com/speed-bumps-ahead-malaysian-stateowned-investors-grapple-startup-funding,"Malaysia’s institutional investors are gearing up to fulfill their mandate to invest in startups and tech firms.
Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim gave the mandate as part of the government’s high-tech push. These state-owned entities are some of the largest investors in the country, and two of them have already answered the call by launching their own funds.

Sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional is the most matured among state-owned financial institutions when it comes to startup investments. / Photo credit: Khazanah Nasional

These firms – also known as government-linked investment companies (GLICs) – typically are conservative in nature, as they are either unit trusts or pension funds. But some of them have already been setting aside small sums, roughly 1% of assets allocated, for tech investments.
But that doesn’t mean that local startups can expect things to change anytime soon, as we found gaps between policy and practice.
‘Notoriously slow and difficult’
Despite these GLICs being deployed to invest in startups, meaning greater funding sources, there are some nuances.
For starters, all these funds report to the prime minister and finance minister in one way or another. Both officials sit on the board of Khazanah Nasional and Permodalan Nasional – two of Malaysia’s state-owned investors – while the other GLICs report to the finance minister as per the law.
In today’s context, Prime Minister Anwar is also the finance minister, but he has appointed another finance minister, Amir Hamzah Azizan, to assist him in running the ministry, including evaluating startup investments.
Another official key to the government’s tech policy is Economic Affairs Minister Rafizi Ramli, who has been pushing for greater investments into startups.
Given the leadership structure of these GLICs, policies of the day will have a bearing on how and where these firms invest. One of the sticking points with Malaysian GLICs, as compared to Singapore’s Temasek, is that they’re guided by affirmative action policies.
This includes a heavy concentration on local startups – more importantly, on those led by bumiputera entrepreneurs.

Malaysia’s Retirement Fund Inc. (KWAP) is an investor in Indonesian startup eFishery. / Photo credit: eFishery.

The term “bumiputera,” translated as sons of the soil, refers to the Malays, the country’s majority ethnic group.
Sources working in these funds tell Tech in Asia that exemptions can be made from time to time if GLICs take an interest in overseas companies or firms led by non-bumiputera Malaysians.
But the thing is, startups in general have to go through a tedious process to secure funding from GLICs, even with affirmative action policies in place.
What happens is that a fund will have to submit their investment recommendations to the Finance Ministry for approval. At the ministry, a dedicated panel will scrutinize the investment – including draft term sheets – and brief the minister.
The ministry will either approve the investment or push it back. If the latter happens, then the fund will have to either drop the investment or negotiate with the ministry.
This entire process, according to the sources we spoke to, can take months and has been among the reasons many large Malaysian startups have missed out on funding rounds.
A Malaysian startup founder tells Tech in Asia on the condition of anonymity that he missed out on the term sheet with a foreign investor twice because one of the GLICs took too long to decide whether it should lead the funding round.
Despite the mandate for GLICs to invest in tech, two officials working in these institutions warn us that realizing those ambitions are easier said than done. While there’s a need to spur the local startup community, they’re finding it difficult to scour for deals, whereas neighbors like Indonesia or Vietnam offer more opportunities.
At the same time, these officials say, there are orders to realize this policy directive. Last year, a moratorium was placed on GLICs, barring these entities from investing in overseas firms until the government sorted out investment policy and direction.
But the Malaysia-based founders we spoke to are looking forward to what they deem as more available sources of funding.
That said, a lawyer who works with both state-owned entities and startups caution that founders shouldn’t approach these institutions if they’re looking for a rescue, as approvals are “notoriously slow and difficult.”
Sovereign mover
Perhaps among the list of GLICs, sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional is the most experienced and the least risk-averse. Facilitating its startup-tech journey is Dana Impak (English for “Impact Fund”) with an allocation of 6 billion ringgit (US$1.26 billion) across five years. The money is coming from Khazanah’s own books.
Khazanah’s strategy has been to invest directly in mature startups and invest as limited partners (LPs) in funds targeting early-stage startups. A recent direct investment is its injection into Malaysian insurtech firm PolicyStreet, while an example of the latter would be partnerships with VC firms Gobi Partners and 500 Global, and Singapore-based accelerator Antler.

For direct investments into tech and startups, Khazanah has a specific unit that would sift through proposals either prepared in-house or made by startup founders. The unit would then raise proposals to the fund’s investment committee, who would bring them up to the Khazanah board for deliberation and approval.
Under the current government, Khazanah also oversees Mavcap – Malaysia’s oldest state-owned VC firm – and Penjana Kapital, another government VC.
The other kids on the block
Aside from Khazanah, another fund that has some tech exposure is civil servants’ pensions fund Retirement Fund Inc. (Also known by its Malay acronym KWAP).
KWAP recently launched its 100 million ringgit (US$21 million) Dana Perintis fund.
The money has been used for two initiatives: direct investments into two homegrown startups, Lapasar and Bateriku, and funding Kuala Lumpur-based VC firm Vynn Capital as well as Antler.
KWAP also made two notable direct investments in the past. The first was a US$30 million investment in ride-hailing giant Uber. The second, and a more recent one, was in Indonesian aquatech giant eFishery.

What’s unique about KWAP is its steady stream of capital, courtesy of annual allocations from the government. The money is then deployed into investments and the returns are distributed to civil servants.
The two other funds throwing some capital into the tech scene are asset manager Permodalan Nasional and private workers’ pensions fund Employees Provident Fund (EPF).
Permodalan Nasional is the most exposed to the policies that cater to the ethnic majority.
The asset manager was created to grow the wealth of bumiputera Malaysians by offering them unit trust funds promising steady returns. There have been funds for non-bumiputera citizens, but those are few and far between.
The company’s notable investment is in used-car marketplace Carro. Another Permodalan Nasional investee, Bursa Malaysia-listed conglomerate Sime Darby, is also an investor in Carro.
Permodalan Nasional has a dedicated investment panel that deliberates on whether the fund should invest in tech firms and how to go about them.
It is also the first GLIC whose investees are investing in a relevant industry as well. Sime Darby, for instance, has an established auto business.
EPF, meanwhile, is the newest entrant to the tech and startup space. This is Malaysia’s largest fund with assets north of 1 trillion ringgit (US$210 billion).
At the time of writing, it has yet to make a direct investment into a tech startup, but it has partnered with 500 Global to play an LP role.
But as said by one of the GLIC sources we spoke to, to truly move the needle, these large institutions will need a proper investment strategy, or they risk cannibalizing by investing in the same set of VCs, industries, and startups.

Thryve.Earth, a Singapore-based carbon project developer, has secured US$2.6 million in a seed funding round led by Temasek-backed VC firm Openspace, bringing the total funds raised by the company to US$3.4 million.
The fundraise was also joined by existing backer Capital Code, an investment management firm focusing on the agri-food sector, and strategic angel investors.
Thryve said that the new funds will facilitate the construction of tools that will de-risk and streamline project assessment as well as design and implement carbon projects.
It will also enable the company to grow its team and expand into other markets in Asia and Latin America.
Thryve is a full-stack project developer headquartered in Singapore with operations in Indonesia, Brazil, and select regions in Africa. It uses a tech stack to assess, design, and implement carbon projects. Technologies leveraged by the firm include remote sensing, machine learning, and advanced modeling.
The company said it has engaged with more than 500 field organizations and landowners across its current markets over the past 18 months to identify “promising project development opportunities.”
“We recognized from the outset that finding projects is only one half of the equation; getting them financed is the other,” said Thryve co-founder and chief project officer Ron Steinherz. “It’s why we’ve put a lot of effort into understanding what financiers need for allocating capital, and then developing scalable tech-enabled solutions to drive value and bridge the financing gap.”
Thryve has also begun servicing more than 400,000 hectares of land for agroforestry, afforestation and reforestation purposes. This has resulted in the potential for more than 3.6 million carbon credits annually, said the company.
Highlighting the finance sector’s transition toward a low-carbon economy, Jaclyn Seow, Openspace’s director of ESG, believes carbon markets have emerged as an “inevitable cornerstone.”
“The principles of verifiable high quality, the ability to adapt to evolving methodologies, and robust stakeholder engagement serve as pivotal differentiators. Thryve exemplifies these principles and are firmly establishing themselves as leaders in this space,” she said.

839702,2024-03-07T01:55:58,2024-03-08T08:57:21,"FirstCry tops in India baby ecommerce, but SEA players face a fragmented region",firstcry-leads-baby-care-ecommerce-india-consolidating-sea-cry,publish,post,https://www.techinasia.com/firstcry-leads-baby-care-ecommerce-india-consolidating-sea-cry,"Melissa Goh contributed to this report.
Necessity is the mother of invention. That was true for FirstCry, which was co-founded by Supam Maheshwari and Amitava Saha in 2010.
Following the birth of his baby, Maheshwari realized that there was a “dearth of variety and quality [baby care products] in the Indian market.”

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Now, FirstCry has become a leader in India’s thriving baby care ecommerce sector and is all set to raise US$219 million from an IPO that is expected to take place after the April to May general elections in India.
The upcoming listing is expected to value the 14-year-old startup – where Japanese tech investor SoftBank holds a 26% stake – at up to US$3.7 billion.
However, running a profitable baby ecommerce business amid the “fiercely competitive” market is hardly child’s play.
This is even more evident in Southeast Asia, where customers are used to purchasing baby care goods from horizontal platforms like Shopee and Lazada. Operational obstacles, a smaller market size, and lack of access to capital create more hurdles for baby ecommerce companies looking to scale in the region.
Digging deeper
Despite recording revenue of US$691 million for the financial year ending March 2023 (FYE 2023), which was over 3x more than in FYE 2021, FirstCry’s bottom line has deteriorated.
Adjusted EBITDA was 14% lower than two years ago, and the company’s post-tax profit actually became negative.

One reason for this has been FirstCry’s aggressive spending on advertising and sales promotions, which increased more than twofold compared to FYE 2021, though it declined as a percentage of revenue from 10.2% to 7.4% over the two-year period.
Indeed, the company warned in its draft red herring prospectus that it may “incur sustained advertising and promotional expenditures or offer more incentives” than anticipated to attract customers.
Although Maheshwari did not respond to our questions on how the firm intends to narrow losses or its strategy to maintain market leadership, the prospectus offers some clues.
The document mentions that one of FirstCry’s biggest strengths is its omnichannel approach.
To be sure, the company understood the online-offline strategy very early and launched its first physical store in 2011. It now has nearly 936 stores in India. Tech in Asia understands that the ecommerce firm uses contact details that it collects from offline shops to send tailored coupons and offers to customers as a strategy to enhance online sales.
Another advantage is its diverse range of home-branded products, including apparel, diapers, feeding and nursing items, and toys – all produced through a network of over 800 contract manufacturers. Controlling the manufacturing of private labels such as Babyhug and Babyoye help the company “improve our gross margins.”
Private labels could also be the key to FirstCry’s profitability, as items from these brands cost 40% to 50% less to manufacture and produce as compared with those from established names.
Finally, FirstCry’s delivery requirements are covered by Xpressbees, which began as FirstCry’s logistics arm in 2012 and was spun out in 2015.

Aside from quality control, having a partner delivery service like Xpressbees allows FirstCry to have more power over operational costs.
Billion-dollar baby
India’s baby care sector is expected to reach US$56 billion to US$60 billion by 2027, according to estimates that Redseer Strategy Consultants shared with Tech in Asia.
In contrast, the market in Southeast Asia is half the size, expected to be around US$26 billion to US$29 billion by 2027.
Analysts Tech in Asia spoke with agree that the region lacks a market leader, unlike in India.
A slowing birth rate in Southeast Asian countries – including the most populous Indonesia – is a major hurdle for players in the region. The archipelago is likely to lose its title as the world’s fourth most populous nation by 2045, while birth rates in the Philippines, Vietnam, and Thailand have plummeted in recent years.
See also: Baby boom: SEA’s mom and babycare startups meld content with commerce
While India’s fertility age is also dropping sharply, over half of its population – nearly 700 million people – is still below the age of 30. This translates to more births and a larger market for baby ecommerce in the coming years.
In comparison, Indonesia has 125 million people below the age of 30, which is less than half of its population. Other Southeast Asian countries like Vietnam and Thailand are some of the most rapidly aging in the world.
These dynamics are just some of the challenges for baby ecommerce players in the region.
SEA of challenges
There are several prominent baby ecommerce players in Southeast Asia, such as Concung in Vietnam, Edamama in the Philippines, and Lilla by Sociolla in Indonesia.

However, none of them have been able to consolidate their positions in the region in the way Shopee or Grab has done in their respective sectors.
Each player has recall value in its own country, but not in the wider region.
“Scaling into different markets of Southeast Asia is quite difficult because the operational setup is different,” Roshni Mahtani Cheung, founder and group CEO of Singapore-based The Parentinc, tells Tech in Asia.
For example, there’s no one bank account that you can use in each of these markets, she explains.
Southeast Asian ecommerce players focused on a single vertical such as baby products have also been challenged by horizontal ecommerce players such as Shopee and Lazada. This is unlike in India, which has seen more balanced growth between horizontal and vertical players.
“Vertical players in Southeast Asia have not received a similar level of capital like India,” Roshan Raj, partner at Redseer Strategy Consultants, tells Tech in Asia. In fact, of the 109 baby ecommerce startups founded in Southeast Asia in the past 10 years, 102 have been unfunded, data sourced from Tracxn shows.
This resembles a classic chicken-and-egg dilemma, where a shortage of growth potential hampers funding, which in turn stunts growth.
One of the exceptions is Concung, which raised US$90 million in 2022 and currently runs over 700 stores across Vietnam. While it holds roughly 62% of the baby essentials market in Vietnam, this may also be a drawback.
Baby essentials include items like diapers and milk formula, which have lower profit margins than products like baby fashion, which FirstCry focuses on, notes Satish Meena, an India-based analyst with Datum Intelligence.

According to Meena, margins in the clothing sector range from 30% to 60%, compared to the 20% and 40% of baby essentials.
Concung CEO Anh Tiến Lưu has not responded to Tech in Asia’s inquiries seeking details of the firm’s market strategy and revenue breakdown.
In India, horizontal ecommerce players such as Amazon and Flipkart are seeing growth in the baby essentials category, but they still lag behind FirstCry, which offers a more tailored shopping experience.
Still, FirstCry will have to watch its back, as large horizontal players are gaining traction in the baby care sector.
In 2023, there was a 40% to 50% year-on-year surge in demand for baby playmats, travel carriers, strollers, and pacifiers on Amazon India, Nishant Raman, director of core consumables at the company, tells Tech in Asia. Amazon India will soon be launching an international baby store as well, he says.

At Flipkart, too, the baby care segment has seen a 1.5x rise in revenue in the last two years with sub-categories like baby gear, baby feeding, and baby bedding essentials seeing substantial growth,” says Manjari Singhal, the FMCG and general merchandise head at Flipkart.
Despite competition, both vertical and horizontal players continue to evolve in India and Southeast Asia, but a FirstCry-like dominance in the latter region is a far cry for now.

1. Revenue growth:
Net revenues for both Q4 and the full year of 2023 grew compared to the same periods in 2022, reaching US$43 billion and US$153 billion, respectively. These indicate an increase of 3.6% and 3.7% from the corresponding year-ago periods.
2. Q4 profitability down, but higher in full-year 2023:
Income from operations for Q4 of 2023 was at roughly US$300 million, a 58% drop from Q4 2022. For the full year, it rose 32% to US$3.7 billion on a year-on-year basis.
The Q4 hit in profitability was due to unallocated items doubling. This includes share-based compensation, the effects of business cooperation arrangements, and the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets.
Meanwhile, JD.com reported US$8.4 billion in positive operating cash flow and US$5.7 billion in free cash flow for the full year of 2023. These amounts indicate that the company is generating sufficient cash from its operations while still having the ability to invest in growth opportunities.
3. New share repurchase program:
JD.com’s board of directors has approved a new share repurchase program, which will take effect when the current one expires on March 17. The new program authorizes the company to repurchase up to US$3 billion worth of shares over the next three years through March 2027.

Photo credit: Bukalapak

As of February 29, 2024, Indonesian ecommerce giant Bukalapak has discontinued its buy now, pay later offering, BukaCicilan. The move adds to a string of exits in the BNPL segment in recent months.
Bukalapak’s decision aims to streamline installment payment options for customers, Desy Hartono, the company’s vice president of financial solutions, told Tech in Asia Indonesia.
Hartono said that users will now be encouraged to apply directly with BNPL providers like Kredivo – an approach that would be more convenient for Bukalapak customers.
BukaCicilan was a feature that was launched in collaboration with Akulaku Finance Indonesia in October 2018.
However, Bukalapak stressed that the closure of BukaCicilan is unrelated to the temporary operating restrictions that were imposed on Akulaku by Indonesia’s Financial Services Authority in October 2023.
Akulaku’s BNPL activities were reinstated as of March 4, 2024.
It’s certainly been a turbulent few months for the BNPL sector, with Singapore-based ShopBack discontinuing its PayLater service, while Atom exited Vietnam. Fellow BNPL player Pace also filed for liquidation in November and India’s ZestMoney underwent a distress sale after a failed acquisition.

Consumer demand and behavior have been changing rapidly over the past couple of years, especially with the coming and going of the Covid-19 pandemic.
To help businesses come out with products that customers can resonate with, Singapore-based SaaS platform Ai Palette has turned to AI. One of its offerings, an F&amp;B-focused virtual assistant named FoodGPT, allows its clients to see emerging consumer trends in real time.
Tin Men Capital, a VC firm from Singapore, has recently pumped US$4 million into Ai Palette, bringing the total raised in its series A1 round to US$5.8 million.
Founded in 2018 by Somsubhra GanChoudhuri and Himanshu Upreti, Ai Palette focuses mainly on the F&amp;B industry.
Using natural language processing in over 18 languages, it pinpoints unmet consumer needs with the help of predictive analytics.
As the AI in F&amp;B market is expected to grow 5x to US$49 billion globally by 2029, Ai Palette hopes to tap into this opportunity through its expansion. The company – which counts industry mainstays like Nestle and Kellogg’s as clients – aims to expand its beauty and nutraceutical offerings and enter markets in North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific.

Hello reader,
In what feels like another life, my first job in Vietnam back in 2015 was as an elementary school teacher.
To put it mildly, teaching was not my calling. Fortunately, the job did teach me how to adapt to whatever the kids, my employers, or anyone else would throw at me.
For instance, experiencing a rolling blackout in the heat of the summer at a school on the outskirts of Hanoi was an eye-opener. I was already drenched in sweat when the ceiling fans slowly stopped spinning, leaving me stuck in a room full of 10-year-olds who were getting increasingly hot and agitated.
I got through the rest of that day with only a minor heat stroke and thought I’d never experience something like that again. Unfortunately, almost 10 years later, occasional rolling summer blackouts are still part of life in Vietnam.
Part of the government’s plan to keep the power flowing is to push for more renewable energy. As today’s premium piece explores, this has led local startups to look into developing homegrown battery technologies.
Today we look at:

Powering Vietnam

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Vietnam’s latest power development plan aims to shift the country’s power generation mix away from coal and toward renewables like hydrogen and ammonia.
For this plan to work though, the ever-thorny problems of the high costs of storage systems and batteries will need to be addressed. Homegrown batteries may be part of the solution.


Cutting costs: Cenergy is one example of a Vietnamese startup that aims to make a big impact on the country’s renewables market. The firm is developing vanadium redox flow batteries, which have several advantages over their counterparts such as higher energy, longer lifespan, and no problems of overcharging.Trinh Viet Dung, Cenergy’s CTO, says setting up large-scale production in Vietnam and locally sourcing materials could cut costs by 30%, which could be particularly attractive for industrial clients.

VinFast charging on: Electric vehicle batteries are also an area of interest for Vietnamese firms, with EV maker VinFast leading the way locally. So far, the company has mainly imported battery cells for its vehicles, but with the acquisition of battery-maker affiliate VinES last October, VinFast will start producing lithium ferro-phosphate battery cells by the third quarter of 2024 via a joint venture with China-based battery maker Gotion.

Heating up: Ho Chi Minh City-based startup Alterno is exploring a different segment: thermal energy storage for heating. The company uses a mixture of sand and its “trade secret” ingredients for high-temperature thermal energy storage of up to 600 degrees Celsius captured from renewable sources.

Smooth sailing for Sea

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Tech giant Sea Group has posted its first positive annual net income, raking in US$163 million for 2023.
The firm recorded US$13 billion in revenue for the year, up 5% from 2022.


Shopee sales swell: Sea’s ecommerce arm saw sales for 2023 hit US$9 billion, up 23% from the year prior. This was partly driven by a 7% increase in Shopee’s gross merchandise value, which stood at US$79 billion for the year.

Gaming struggles: Garena, Sea’s gaming unit, faced declining revenue of US$2.2 billion in 2023, down 44% year on year. The firm’s revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was US$511 million, its lowest quarterly figure for the year.

Swimming in money: On the other hand, SeaMoney, the group’s financial services business, enjoyed a bumper 2023. Revenue for the year hit US$1.8 billion, 44% higher than in 2022.

1️⃣ Dirty money
An Indian regulator has found a money laundering scheme linked to Singaporean shell companies and fintech firm Nium, The Straits Times reported. The Enforcement Directorate alleges that shell companies in India are using fake invoices issued by shell companies in Singapore to pay for software and other services, with Nium India being used as a conduit for these transactions.
2️⃣ Don’t call it a comeback
Akulaku’s buy now, pay later services are back in operation after Indonesia’s Financial Services Authority (OJK) lifted the restrictions it had slapped on the offering. The OJK limited Akulaku’s operations in October 2023 over alleged violations of supervisory obligations related to BNPL services.
3️⃣ Food for thought
Foodtech firm Eat Just has suspended operations in Singapore, The Straits Times reported. The American firm behind plant-based egg substitute Just Egg and cultivated meat brand Good Meat is facing a US$100 million lawsuit from its bioreactor manufacturer in the US.

After hitting its first profitable year in 2023, Sea Group expects to be in the black for 2024, and it’s looking at Shopee to drive it.
Overall, Sea expects its ecommerce arm to grow in the high teens for the full 2024 year, chairman and group CEO Forrest Li said in the company’s latest earnings call. But Indonesia, where Shopee is the “clear market leader,” had particularly good numbers in Q4 2023.
“Compared to a year ago, we gained sizable market shares,” Li added. “We are going to execute even better over this year, given the foundations we built during the last year,” especially on aspects like service quality and price competitiveness, he added.
A major growth driver for Shopee in Southeast Asia’s largest market has been livestreaming. While it accounted for roughly 15% of total Shopee orders in the region in December 2023, the percentage is even bigger in Indonesia.
Meanwhile, Shopee has been improving the unit economics for livestreaming over the past few months, Li said. The feature’s retention and repurchase rates have been trending up, while attracting new users, though it’s still not as high as the rest of its regular ecommerce transactions.
“This also enables us to compete effectively with our competitors,” he explained. “If you look at a year ago, we probably don’t have this ecosystem. We have to invest to build this ecosystem.”
Answering a question about Shopee’s battle for market dominance with TikTok Shop, Li conceded that Sea’s platform has benefited from Indonesia’s ban on its rival. However, he believes it’s not the sole reason for Shopee’s Q4 success.
“We’ve seen similar growth trend continued in Q1 as well, even as the landscape has changed,” he said, noting Shopee’s scale, local leadership and operating teams, and time-tested infrastructure as some of its key advantages over its competitors. “All in all, we’re pretty happy with what we see in Q1 so far.”
While much of Sea’s focus is on Shopee, it doesn’t expect digital entertain arm Garena to lag behind. Yanjun Wang, Sea’s group chief corporate officer, said that Garena has been incorporating more AI tech into its development operations to expand its genre portfolio and content scope.
Commenting on Garena’s rocky performance throughout 2023, Wang said this can be attributed to the seasonality of the gaming space, with launches and esports events generating buzz at different periods.
But for its highest-earner Free Fire, Sea is “very positive based on the trends” it has seen so far, said Wang. The company expects double-digit growth for Free Fire year on year in 2024, both in terms of user base and bookings.

Temasek Holdings, a Singapore state-owned investment firm, is in early-stage discussions to back OpenAI, the Financial Times reported.
The talks come as Singapore looks to become an Asian AI powerhouse, having set aside roughly US$742 million for investments in the sector. Should the deal materialize, Temasek would be the ChatGPT developer’s first state-backed investor.
Temasek declined to comment “on market speculations” at Tech in Asia’s request, while OpenAI has yet to respond.
According to the report, the discussions evolved over several meetings between Temasek executives and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Initially, the investment firm showed interest in Altman’s VC fund, but the focus has shifted to OpenAI itself.
As conversations are ongoing, the potential investment’s size is yet to be determined. Nevertheless, the investment could help propel Singapore’s ambitions of widening its local AI talent pool and setting up AI centers with leading partner companies.
Despite its rapid revenue increase following the launch of ChatGPT, OpenAI operates at a loss. In 2022, the company doubled its losses year on year to US$540 million due to hefty research and development expenses.
One major obstacle for the firm is a scarcity in AI-focused chips. This is partly why Altman is wooing investors – including the government of the United Arab Emirates – in order to raise as much as trillions of US dollars for a “wildly ambitious tech initiative.”
OpenAI has seen a recent surge in valuation and continued interest from global investors, despite an ongoing investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission as well as a breach of contract lawsuit from Elon Musk, a co-founder of the AI firm.

The moral of the story is clear: Innovation is essential to the survival of any business.
That’s a notion that Vijay Chandrasekhar, co-founder and CEO of Singapore-based solar cell startup Cosmos Innovation, is acutely aware of. The firm develops advanced solar cell technologies to enhance renewable energy efficiency and sustainability for the solar and semiconductor industries.
“We are seeing some of the most disruptive technology and geopolitical market shifts of our time,” says Chandrasekhar. “Businesses that stay nimble and rapidly evolve will be able to capture new emerging opportunities and thrive.”
Overcoming a pandemic
Chandrasekhar and his co-founder Joel Li learned this lesson early on. In the first few months of Cosmos Innovation’s launch, the company had its first big hurdle: surviving the pandemic.
“Covid-19 hit immediately after we closed our first seed round of financing with leading Silicon Valley investors,” recalls the CEO, who witnessed the seismic shifts the pandemic caused in the tech and startup world. For a startup like Cosmos Innovation, which had limited resources to fall back on in the event of a crisis, the situation could’ve easily spelled doom.

However, amid the turmoil, Chandrasekhar also spotted an opportunity: He believed that the company needed to develop its AI process optimization platform for solar cells. He was right. With the upgrade in its tech, the firm achieved up to a 10x improvement in development time and major improvements in target performance metrics.
That said, developing the AI technology was expensive, given the time and resources required to collect proprietary data sets and build up the unique AI capabilities required.
That’s why Cosmos Innovation sought a partnership with the Agency for Science, Technology, and Research (ASTAR), a public sector agency in Singapore that aims to advance scientific discovery and develop innovative technology.
Through the agency’s Growing Enterprises through Technology Upgrade (GET-Up) program, Cosmos Innovation gained access to R&amp;D lines and key experimental data. ASTAR’s Institute of Microelectronics also enabled the firm to build its AI process optimization capabilities rapidly. On top of this, the company could tap into a deep bench of top AI talent via the agency’s Institute for Infocomm Research.
These avenues “played a critical role in helping us build up our AI capabilities in the early days,” says Chandrasekhar.
The company’s AI proof points, which were built during its partnership with ASTAR, enabled the CEO and his team to attract a set of global investors for the firm’s series A round. Today, it counts Temasek Xora – the early-stage arm of Temasek – Innovation Endeavors, Two Sigma Ventures, DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis, and MIT researcher Tomaso Poggio among its backers.
The firm has since transitioned to focusing on next-generation solar cells as its core product, and it’s built the world’s first self-learning fab – a factory for making advanced electronic products – in Singapore to accelerate the commercialization of these solar cells.
But Chandrasekhar makes it clear that the GET-Up program still offers vast benefits to the firm even now, particularly in areas where cutting-edge AI capabilities play a crucial role in solving last-mile engineering challenges.
Gaining global recognition
Chandrasekhar isn’t alone in understanding the importance of innovation in overcoming business hurdles. Tan Ser Hean, managing director of Abrasive Engineering, knew it was paramount to stay ahead when the company faced roadblocks in its global commercialization ambitions in 2017. The Singapore-based firm manufactures surface treatment equipment used by companies in the basic metal working industry, the electronics sector, and other segments.

“We encountered challenges in streamlining product development, reducing time to market, establishing credibility, and accessing funding for research and development,” explains Tan.
Seeking an innovative solution, Abrasive Engineering turned to ASTAR’s GET-Up program.
“[ASTAR’s] Operation and Technology Roadmap initiative provided us with a strategic review of our current business operations and technology capabilities,” he explains. This allowed the firm to anticipate future challenges and capture new market regions, sectors, and products.
The company was also given access to ASTAR’s research pool, cutting-edge R&amp;D tools, state-of-the-art facilities, and crucial government funding, which allowed Abrasive Engineering to tackle its concerns head-on.
Tan says the impact can be seen in hard numbers.
“Financially, the program resulted in the generation of intellectual properties and a remarkable US$2.2 million increase in revenue within four years,” he points out. Tan adds that the company also expanded into new regions and secured purchase orders worth US$2 million for its projects.
Continuous innovation
Having made significant headway in developing its AI platform technology, Cosmos Innovation is already planning its next step in capturing the solar cell market.
“We plan to go beyond the R&amp;D phase and scale to pilot lines, subsequently building AI-first gigafactories in the coming years,” says Chandrasekhar.
Abrasive Engineering’s Tan also revealed that the company is striving to continue with its global expansion by growing its product line.
That said, he is keenly aware of how resource-intensive Abrasive Engineering’s ambitions will be, so continuing its partnership with ASTAR will be crucial to achieving its goals.
“We strongly believe our collaboration with public agencies such as ASTAR enables us to stay at the forefront of advanced manufacturing, offering cutting-edge solutions that address industry challenges, enhance productivity, and keep us relevant in the future economy,” he says.

Abrasive Engineering and Cosmos Innovation are just two of more than 2,000 budding businesses that ASTAR has partnered with through the GET-Up program, which last year celebrated 20 years of working with local enterprises to improve their global competitiveness.
Today, ASTAR continues to work with Singapore-based firms across all stages of development, providing them access to human capital, shared R&amp;D resources, and technology capabilities to achieve a competitive advantage.
“The journey ahead will require building an extensive set of new capabilities, and we are excited to continue partnering with the GET-Up program and ASTAR’s research entities on this journey,” says Chandrasekhar.

The Agency for Science, Technology, and Research (ASTAR) enhances scientific innovation and technology development to boost economic growth and societal well-being, bridging academia and industry, and fostering collaborations with the research community, public agencies, multinational corporations and local enterprises for impactful outcomes in Singapore and beyond.
Its Growing Enterprises through Technology Upgrade program is a proactive integrated approach that helps boost the global competitiveness of Singapore-based technology-intensive enterprises by equipping them with the necessary skills and expertise for the knowledge-based economy.

How did you get into marketing?
I studied marketing throughout my tertiary education, and consumer behavior was one of my favorite subjects – I found it fascinating how creative and fun marketing activations can be and how they eventually influence purchase decisions. I wanted to be involved in the creation of such campaigns.
In your view, what is the most underrated or underappreciated part of marketing?
People always say that sales is the one bringing in the money, and marketing is the one spending the money. But the reality is that revenue relies on marketing investment!
What’s your favorite marketing campaign of all time?
McDonald’s as a brand inspires me. The fast-food chain consistently comes up with fresh and fun marketing campaigns despite its established brand; no complacency here. In 2022, it launched a “scream for ice-cream” campaign in Singapore on the same day masks were made optional – it was very clever and timely.
Many other campaigns by McDonald’s have also gone viral here, such as the Hello Kitty plushies back in the 2000s and more recent collaborations with K-pop groups like BTS and NewJeans.
What are you most excited about for TIA’s events in 2024?
With two new signature events added to the slate, there’s much more synergy and cross-collaboration within the marketing team – and also with other teams – as we learn from how each other’s campaigns are progressing. Fun fact: Tech in Asia Conference Kuala Lumpur will be my first time leading the end-to-end marketing for a signature event – I’d previously been more involved in the events production side of things. Exciting times ahead!
Marilyn Koh, events marketer

How did you get into marketing?
In a prior role in ecommerce, I organized site activations for product launches or branded events and collaborated closely with businesses to develop compelling promotions aimed at driving engagement and sales.
This might all seem like a lot of behind-the-scenes work, but it was fulfilling and encouraging to see how experimenting with different strategies could not only increase KPI figures but also put smiles on attendees’ faces.
I wanted to delve deeper into the realm of marketing, and this led me to join Tech in Asia, where I actively bridge events and marketing in a dynamic role. It’s been a journey of discovery and growth, and I’ve loved every moment of it.
In your view, what is the most underrated or underappreciated part of marketing?
The amount of blood, sweat, and tears that goes into every single piece of marketing material you see out there. Each post is really thoughtfully curated.
On another tack, and as an events marketer, seeing the sign-ups flood in at the end of every campaign makes it all worthwhile!
What’s your favorite marketing campaign of all time?
The “Why So Serious?” campaign promoting the film The Dark Knight in 2007 left an indelible mark on me, so much so that I wrote an essay on it in university. The suspenseful storyline and real-life activations made for a truly immersive journey 🤯.
What are you most excited about for TIA’s events in 2024?
This year is all about going places! It’s also my first time leading marketing for a signature event, so I’m super stoked to dive into Saigon Summit and Vietnam as a whole, given the country’s rich history and vibrant culture!

I majored in marketing at university. I started my career in the research field, but I kept my interest in marketing and was surprised at how quickly whatever I had learned became outdated. I made the decision to immerse myself into the more “modern” side of marketing by joining Tech in Asia. Tech in Asia Conference 2018 was pivotal, as it was my introduction to marketing and to the tech industry.
In your view, what is the most underrated or underappreciated part of marketing?
I believe that operational excellence is often underestimated. While strategic planning provides the roadmap for marketing initiatives, it’s the execution that truly defines success – paying attention to the operational details leads to better outcomes.
What’s your favorite marketing campaign of all time?
Netflix’s campaign for the show 13 Reasons Why left a lasting impression on me. Despite the show’s dark subject matter, the campaign was innovative in bringing the characters to life beyond the screen – for example, Netflix made Instagram accounts for the characters and they were pretty convincing, looking just like the account of a typical high-schooler of the time.
Moreover, Netflix used the series as a platform to spark conversations about important societal issues like mental health and sexual violence, showcasing the streaming platform’s commitment to not only its business goals but also broader social impact.
What are you most excited about for TIA’s events in 2024?
I’m the marketing lead for Tech in Asia Conference Jakarta and Product Development Conference – also set to take place in Jakarta. Looking ahead at our agenda for 2024, I’m particularly excited about our focus on exploring new markets, addressing community challenges, and staying ahead of industry trends.

The crisis at Indonesia-focused Investree has opened a can of worms.
The prominent peer-to-peer lending startup was rocked by allegations of financial misconduct involving its former CEO and co-founder, Adrian Gunadi.

Investree’s US$231 million series D funding round, announced in October 2023 and led by Qatar-based firm JTA, has been cast in doubt, following revelations that the startup had secured a US$7 million “rescue package.”
However, Investree co-founder Lim Kok Chuan insists that JTA’s money is still on the way, citing a commitment letter from the investment firm.
But Tech in Asia found that questions were raised about JTA’s ability to follow through on investment agreements.
We also could not verify some key facts regarding JTA, including its CEO Amir Ali Salemizadeh’s claim of having a master’s in business administration from a well-known US university.
The troubles at Investree are part of a long string of reports about corporate governance and due diligence lapses among venture-backed startups that have cracked under pressure as capital became scarce.
Tech in Asia has reached out to representatives of JTA and its announced portfolio projects but did not get answers.
While Investree did not comment on its due diligence on JTA, both parties said in a joint statement that the “collaborative partnership is speeding ahead.”
Emails and messages sent to a few Investree shareholders also remained unanswered.
Waiting on the money
Investree, established in 2015 by Gunadi and Amir Amiruddin, who were joined by Lim in 2019, counts VC firms Kejora Star Capital and SBI Ventures Singapore as its major shareholders.
Things appeared to kick into high gear when Investree announced a massive series D haul in October 2023.
Participants in this round supposedly also included existing investors, namely MUFG Innovation Partners, the VC arm of a Japanese banking giant, and BRI Ventures, an investment firm backed by Bank Rakyat Indonesia.
But funding news sometimes does not live up to the hype. Deal talks can fall through, or the actual amount can fall short of what was announced.
JTA’s investment in the US$231 million round isn’t reflected in regulatory filings, Tech in Asia confirmed. The firm did possess about 3.4% of Investree’s Singapore entity, but the startup did not register any paid-up capital in exchange.
JTA was supposed to invest through a joint venture with Investree, the announcement stated.
According to Investree and JTA, the JV “has been actively engaged in obtaining the necessary approvals for fund disbursement,” including legal and financial compliance, since 2023. 
A closer look
Salemizadeh’s LinkedIn profile states that he has been JTA’s CEO for 14 years and holds a PhD in strategic management from Iran’s Mashhad University. Tech in Asia reached out to the university for confirmation, but the email remains unanswered.
According to his Facebook page and one of JTA’s websites, Salemizadeh obtained an MBA from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). Tech in Asia checked this with the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC), an academic verification service based in the US.

We could not find any record of Salemizadeh attending or graduating from the university, even though we used a few possible name combinations in our search.
One possible reason for this is that he never enrolled at the university, although NSC does mention that he might have chosen to keep his records private.
Salemizadeh’s enrollment might also have occurred before CMU became involved with the NSC, or the university might have blocked the release of his records.

As for JTA itself, its website says the firm provides “investment solutions” across eight themes and has six subsidiaries across different industries.
The JTA website also prominently displays several honors from The Bizz Awards, which calls itself “one of the world’s most important business awards.”

Of the eight investments that JTA listed on its website, four of them – Investree included – are from Southeast Asia. The other three investments are in the projects of IBN Corp., a Malaysia-based property developer. IBN’s director, Branden Ng, is apparently the country manager for JTA in Malaysia as well.
Tech in Asia contacted IBN for comment, but the company did not respond. We have also reached out to JTA’s other portfolio companies: Quetta Gladiators, a sports franchise based in Pakistan, and NSATech, a Qatar-headquartered AI startup.
While a message to NSATech founder and CEO Hussain Nikkar did not elicit a response, a Quetta Gladiators executive declined to comment on the project, saying it is confidential and in development.
A former JTA freelancer speaks
Reza Zandieh, who says he was a Germany-based freelancer for JTA, tells Tech in Asia that he had brought over 15 projects to the investment firm between June 2020 and December 2022. However, he says that JTA did not end up investing in any of them.
In fact, Zandieh claims that aside from losing many business relationships, he and other freelancers also lost more than US$10,853 over two years while bringing potential deals to the firm.
He then alleges that JTA asked for US$80,000 from him to co-finance a project. He backed out after having doubts about it.
According to JTA’s website, the firm’s management team consists of seven people. Tech in Asia contacted each of them except for Ali Bagheri – a new employee – on LinkedIn, seeking details about their roles in JTA.
Bassim Aboobacker, who is listed as JTA’s assistant to the advisory board, referred us back to the firm’s website. He ignored the questions that we had sent him.
Tech in Asia had also called the JTA office in Qatar. Bagheri, who is executive assistant to the CEO, picked up and said Aboobacker would contact us later. We did not hear back from him.
Large sums in a dormant company?
JTA’s Salemizadeh also claimed to possess 950 million British pounds (US$1.2 billion) in the bank account of the firm’s dormant UK entity, according to 2021 and 2022 filings with the Companies House.

Photo credit: UK’s Companies House website

It’s unclear why an entity with no business activity would have such a large sum of money. Ex-JTA freelancer Zandieh claims he did not receive any proof of the bank account despite asking the firm for it.
For Investree, a lot is riding on Doha-based JTA coming through with the investment. The startup is also facing other issues. For one, it recently admitted that setbacks in the repayment of loans on its platform is leading to delays in the return of funds to creditors. However, it is optimistic that the JTA partnership will help rectify “the pressing matter in Investree Indonesia.”
Meanwhile, Indonesia’s Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (OJK) is conducting an in-depth probe of Investree. The financial regulator will also coordinate with law enforcement “if there are indications of criminal violations.”
Update (March 6, 12:40 p.m. SGT): This article was updated to include comments from a joint statement issued by Investree and JTA.

Investments in AI have been mounting, and Alibaba has been quick to the jump to become one of China’s dominant forces in the space. In its latest move, the ecommerce major led an over US$600 million funding round for Chinese startup MiniMax.
The deal brought MiniMax’s valuation to over US$2.5 billion and marks Alibaba’s second major AI investment just this year – after recently leading a US$1 billion round for Moonshot AI, which valued it at US$2.5 billion too.
MiniMax is a China-based AI startup that specializes in social AI, developing AI companions and virtual characters for interactive experiences.
Currently, the startup offers two AI character role-playing apps: Talkie for international markets and Xing Ye for China.
Notably, in June last year, MiniMax raised US$250 million from a Tencent-backed entity, among others.
For its AI ambitions, Alibaba is also implementing a comprehensive plan aimed at fostering growth of independent business units, ranging from cloud computing to logistics, Bloomberg reported. 
A key focus of this initiative is the revitalization of the cloud business. According to Bloomberg, the cloud unit currently serves approximately 80% of the China’s tech companies and hosts 50% of the country’s generative AI firms.
Alibaba is also trying to integrate AI – including its in-house model Tongyi Qianwen – across the company’s diverse operations, which include entertainment.

Hello reader,
Conflict resolution is hard, which partially explains why lawyers get paid so well.
Some friends and I recently had to try and mend some old wounds with an opponent in the amateur football league I’m part of. In the end, we weren’t entirely successful in getting everyone to leave the past in the past, but I still learned a thing or two.
We went in with an olive branch extended but were also politely firm about the red lines we couldn’t cross, which I think was a good approach. I also learned that despite the best intentions of everyone involved, some things can’t be fixed.
It seems two of the co-founders of Cake Group might be a little closer to resolving their conflict, with former CTO U-Zyn Chua thinking of purchasing the crypto firm outright. It likely wasn’t easy to get to this point, but the question remains as to how badly both sides want to put this whole saga to bed.
Today we look at:


The latest legal twist in the Cake Group saga 
Another quarter in the black for PropertyGuru
Other newsy highlights such as East Ventures and Temasek Foundation kicking off the second edition of their climate tech competition, and Wise pausing support for its e-wallet in Indonesia.


Premium summary
Taking the cake?

Image credit: Timmy Loen

After asking the Singapore High Court to wind up the company in December 2023, former Cake Group CTO U-Zyn Chua is mulling buying the firm.
At a recent court hearing, a potential deal was announced, which would see Chua buy out the crypto firm’s CEO and co-founder Julian Hosp’s interest in the company.


Why can’t we be friends?: The deal, whose terms weren’t announced, could end months of in-fighting between Chua and Hosp, which began after a round of layoffs at the firm in November last year. Chua said he was opposed to the layoffs and claimed that Hosp carried out the job cuts unilaterally. Soon after, Chua filed the winding-up application and resigned from his post. 

Boom to bust: Cake Group enjoyed a meteoric rise, with revenue and operating income hitting US$631 million and US$203 million, respectively, in 2021. However, as with much of the crypto market, the demise of Terra Labs in 2022 hit Cake Group hard, with revenue falling by more than half to US$266 million and profit down to US$23.5 million.

Mistakes were made: In an email sent to employees last November, Hosp said the company grew its costs too quickly and underestimated the impact of the crypto market slowdown. He is resisting the winding-up application.

PropertyGuru recorded a net income of around US$820,000 for the fourth quarter of 2023, bouncing back from a loss of about US$3.9 million in the same period in 2022.
It was the second consecutive quarter in the black for the online property portal.


Loving life in the Lion City: PropertyGuru said its strong performance in Singapore helped to offset challenging conditions elsewhere. Marketplace revenue for Q4 was up 4.1% year on year at US$29.7 million.

Tough sledding in Vietnam: On the other hand, Vietnam has been a tough market for PropertyGuru of late amid consumer-credit concerns, though it did record positive adjusted EBITDA in all its markets. The company is also closing two out of nine branches relating to its marketplace business in Vietnam.

No buyback: CFO Joe Dische said PropertyGuru is not mulling a share buyback program. Instead, the money raised from the firm’s listing in 2022 is for potential M&amp;A deals.

Thailand’s Finance Ministry said the country is opening applications for virtual bank permits for the next six months, Reuters reported.
This decision is aimed at extending financial services to those lacking or having limited access to banks. According to a report from financial services firm Macquarie in May 2022, half of Thailand’s population has no access to financial products, while 18% remains underbanked.
The ministry specified that prospective banks need adequate business experience and funds to operate a commercial bank. Thailand’s officials have not placed a limit on the number of permits to be issued, however.
Several major banks in the country have previously expressed their intention to establish a virtual bank, such as SCBX, which partnered with KakaoBank to pursue the license. This collaboration mirrors moves by players like Grab and Singtel, as well as Standard Chartered and FairPrice Group in Singapore to form GXS Bank and Trust Bank, respectively.
The Finance Ministry and Bank of Thailand will have nine months to review applications, with approved virtual banks set to be given a year to set up and begin their services. The final verdict will be based on what fits the existing system of Thai financial institutions, the ministry said.
Previously, the Bank of Thailand has conducted two public consultations to formulate the licensing framework for virtual banks. Based on its website, the country’s central bank described that virtual banks “offer services mainly through the digital channel” and are not allowed to establish physical branches.

Hi there,
Recently, I was rewatching The Hobbit trilogy. I enjoy watching prequels, mainly because of my curiosity about characters’ pasts.
As a journalist, one of the things I find most interesting is the career paths and decisions people have taken. Even with many of the colleagues I have worked with, the paths they have taken are very different from my own. While some made conscious decisions to pursue their professions, others had accidentally stumbled into them.
That’s why I find our first Big Story interesting. My colleague Peter visually maps the journey of nearly 80 founders and co-founders of unicorn startups across Southeast Asia to see if any of them shared common traits during their journey to the billion-dollar club.
Interestingly, one of the points that emerged is that 58% of the unicorn founders had attained a postgraduate degree. This – and the tough competition for funding – could help explain why we recently came across some founders in the region lying about their academic qualifications.
In the second Big Story, my colleague Scott digs into the financials of Block Solutions, the parent firm of the popular blockchain explorer Etherscan. While many crypto and Web3 startups have been struggling since last year, the Malaysia-based company is one of the few that have managed to carve out a successful path.
Block Solutions’ net profit has grown by 33x over the last four years. But unlike other crypto firms that make money from staking, trading, or mining cryptocurrencies, the company relies on a traditional method – advertising – to fuel its growth.
In AI Odyssey, I look into Ola’s launch of its large language model Krutrim AI. But first, our Big Stories.

AI ODYSSEY
Promising AI projects we’re noticing
Ola gets its fingers burnt in genAI launch gaffe
Despite all of humanity’s prowess at recording history, we humans keep making the same mistakes. It’s ironic how many quotes there are reminding us that “history keeps repeating itself.”
We saw this recently play out in the generative AI space. About a year after Google’s gaffe with factual errors during the release of its large language model (LLM) Bard, Indian ride-hailing and EV player Ola seems to have followed suit with the public launch of the beta version of Krutrim AI.
The level of hallucinations and inaccuracies with Krutrim AI was the talk of the town.

Image credit: Timmy Loen

The results fell far short of expectations, as senior executives at the company said last year that Krutrim AI would “outperform GPT-4 and Llama-2.”
Similar to when Bard was first released, it seems that the beta launch of Krutrim AI was rushed. Ola founder and CEO Bhavish Aggarwal had announced that the firm was joining the genAI race just two months earlier.
Even more embarrassing for Aggarwal and his company was that when users asked Krutrim AI who created it, the model replied: OpenAI.
Ola said that these problems were caused by a data leak at one of their open-source datasets and that it has since been fixed.
However, while the hallucinations slightly lessened after the fix, the genAI model still faced issues with its responses.
Krutrim AI’s reply to many queries was that “its current knowledge is limited.” It also couldn’t produce answers to questions about simple historical facts and math problems.
To Aggarwal’s credit, this is not the first time one of his products has gone up in flames at launch but ended up finding success later. He has managed to douse out the flames for Ola Electric to succeed in the EV space.
But what was probably the largest embarrassment for Krutrim AI was its inability to handle regional languages. The LLM was launched as India’s own model, which was said to be able to understand 22 Indian languages and generate content in about 10 of them.
However, the tests showed that the model wasn’t able to understand Assamese, which is one of the 22 official languages recognized by the Indian government and spoken by over 15 million people.
Besides English, the company says Krutrim AI can respond in languages such as Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Kannada, Gujarati, and even Hinglish – a colloquial blend of Hindi and English.
When tested, the model wasn’t able to give accurate responses in Hinglish or Hindi slang.
In comparison, the Sea-Lion LLM, which was launched by AI Singapore last month, seems to be far ahead in its responses in terms of its grasp of local languages and cultures.
When the main reason for regional LLMs to exist is to eliminate the bias that foreign models present, developers have to get the languages and cultural context right.
Not surprisingly, Krutrim AI’s glitches last week brought about questions about the US$50 million that it raised to become India’s first AI unicorn.
To be fair, this is only the beta version of the model, and the company expects to sort out these issues when it launches its Krutrim Pro version in the second quarter of this year.
But if it wants to be taken seriously in the AI race and adopted by businesses in India for enterprise use – which would be its best hope for monetization – the company will need to make sure that its LLM performs much better.

Global ride-hailing firm Bolt is hiring a country manager in Malaysia, suggesting that the company may expand to the country soon.
On its career page, the Estonia-based company stated it is looking for an exec to “lead and launch” its ride-hailing business in Malaysia.
According to the post, the country manager will be based in Kuala Lumpur and will work with teams from local operations and the company’s headquarters, as well as with the regional manager and stakeholders such as regulators.
Tech in Asia has reached out to Bolt for comments.
If the expansion pushes through, Malaysia will become the firm’s second market in Southeast Asia after Thailand.
According to a report from Mordor Intelligence, Bolt holds the second-largest market share for ride-hailing services in Thailand, operating in seven local cities. The firm appears to also have been chipping away slowly at Grab’s dominance in the market.
Bolt currently offers services with cars, motorcycles, and taxis in Thailand. However, in Malaysia, regulators prohibit ride-hailing services for two-wheelers.
For four-wheelers, Malaysia is still dominated by popular incumbents such as Grab and MyCar. Bolt will also face competition from other players like AirAsia Ride, EzCab, Maxim, and inDrive.
Founded by Markus Villig in 2013, Bolt said it has served more than 150 million customers across 45 countries. Its other Asian markets include Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Lebanon, and Nepal.
The company is also expanding into new markets across other continents. Recently, it entered the Egyptian market by launching in Cairo, following previous entries into Botswana and Zimbabwe.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED), an Indian regulator, has found a money laundering scheme linked to Singaporean shell companies, The Straits Times reported.
The regulator, which is an agency under India’s Ministry of Finance, said that shell companies in India are using fake invoices issued by shell companies in Singapore to pay for software and other services.
These transactions were funded through loans, gambling, and betting apps controlled by “Chinese entities,” the ED added.
Money from these activities was purportedly laundered through mule bank accounts in India, using payment aggregators for transactions. The agency alleged that Nium India, a subsidiary of Singapore-based fintech firm Nium, was used as a conduit for these illicit funds, which also included cryptocurrencies.
In response, the ED said it has frozen 1.2 billion rupees (US$14.9 million) tied to the Singaporean shell companies from Nium India’s accounts.
A Nium spokesperson told The Straits Times that the company is working with the ED, emphasizing the investigation revolves around certain transactions facilitated through its Indian arm by “alleged bad actors” in the country that do not involve its Singapore entity.
The development may prompt Indian regulators to tighten rules regarding payment aggregators in the country. Last year, the country had already made amendments to its anti-money laundering regulations to expand its scope.
Nium itself has recently obtained in-principal approval for payment aggregator licenses from the Reserve Bank of India. The spokesperson emphasized that the company is currently not licensed to collect funds.

This article is part of Inspiring Inclusion, Tech in Asia’s campaign for International Women’s Day 2024, which ties in with our larger initiative to support women in tech by shining the spotlight on their stories, the impact they’ve had, and their achievements.
The value of having women in leadership positions is well documented. For one, businesses with women at the helm are more profitable and open to transformation and change. They also have greater diversity among their teams, which in turn is correlated with greater innovation – an essential element in Southeast Asia’s rapidly evolving digital economy.
As part of our efforts to commemorate International Women’s Day and boost support for women across the tech ecosystem, Tech in Asia has created a list of women who run the show at the region’s top-funded companies. While we realize that funding may not be the best or only indicator of success, it’s certainly a helpful metric. Do also note that to keep the list of top-funded companies fresh, we’ve only included funding data from the past two years.
To identify these leaders, we leveraged the Tech in Asia database and culled information from LinkedIn as well as company websites and organizational charts. We chose to limit the list to founders and C-suite executives of these firms.
We hope that this list will not just be an inspiration but also a celebration of the many female leaders in our midst who are building vital, thriving businesses in Southeast Asia.

The Wagely Indonesia team / Photo credit: Wagely

After hitting 1 million salary disbursements since its launch four years ago, Indonesia-based Wagely announced it has secured US$23 million in new funding. This is the largest investment bagged by an earned-wage access (EWA) company in the country to date, Wagely said.
Capria Ventures, a VC firm specializing in the global south, is leading the equity portion of the round. A notable private debt fund, which is expected to help Wagely expand its services in Indonesia and Bangladesh, also joined the round.
Since its launch in 2020, Wagely has been helping employees across its two markets collect their earned wages immediately after a day’s work, if they so choose.
In 2023 alone, Wagely has seen substantial activity, with over US$25 million in salaries paid out through nearly a million transactions, reaching half a million workers.
Dave Richards, managing partner at Capria Ventures, hinted that Wagely could tap generative AI for use cases such as document processing and local language communication with workers. The VC firm is mostly focused on applied genAI investments and has US$188 million in assets under management.
Integrating genAI could beef up Wagely’s arsenal as it goes up against EWA peers GajiGesa and Gajiku, which have over 200 and more than 100 client firms, respectively.
The fundraise also comes roughly a week after Wagely named its founder Kevin Hausburg as CEO. He replaces his co-founder  Tobias Fischer, who held the top role for over four years.

Akulaku office / Photo credit: Akulaku

Indonesia’s Financial Services Authority (OJK) has lifted restrictions on the buy now, pay later (BNPL) service of fintech firm Akulaku, the company told Tech in Asia.
“Akulaku PayLater as our BNPL product [is] again active to distribute financing to users and customers as before,” the firm said.
This comes over four months after OJK limited the operations of Akulaku in October over alleged violations to the supervisory obligations that the regulator requires of BNPL offerings. These also involve regulations on risk management and good corporate governance.
At the time, the company said its focus was to ensure “strict compliance with all regulations” set by OJK.
The new ruling is significant, as BNPL startups are struggling to stay on their feet in Southeast Asia.
Just last week, Singapore-based ShopBack announced that it would be discontinuing its BNPL service, PayLater. Last year Atome had also exited Vietnam, while online payment platform Pace filed for liquidation.
Aside from BNPL, Akulaku’s services include virtual credit cards, wealth management offerings, and digital banking services through Bank Neo Commerce.
Founded in 2014, Akulaku has raised US$530 million in disclosed funding so far, according to Tech in Asia data. Backed by companies like Ant Financial, Akulaku is also present in Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam.

Sea Group posted its first positive annual net income of US$163 million for 2023, while clocking in US$13 billion in revenue for the year, up 5% from 2022.
However, the New York Stock Exchange-listed company remained in the red in the fourth quarter of 2023, although its net loss of US$112 million narrowed from Q3’s US$144 million.
Revenue for Q4 2023 was US$3.6 billion, 5% higher than a year ago – growth it mostly owed to Shopee.
Sales at the group’s ecommerce arm rose 23% for the year to US$9 billion, partly thanks to a 7% uptick in its gross merchandise value – which hit US$79 billion.
Shopee’s Q4 2023 revenue was US$2.6 billion, 23% higher than Q4 of the previous year. Adjusted losses were reported at US$225 million, which was an improvement from the previous quarter’s negative US$347 million.
The ecommerce unit’s adjusted EBITDA for the full year was negative US$214 million – improving significantly from negative US$1.7 billion in 2022.
These results came amid fierce competition in Southeast Asia, especially from TikTok Shop in Indonesia. However, Sea Group CEO and founder Forrest Li said that he expects Shopee to maintain its market share in the region this year, while returning to the black (in terms of adjusted earnings) in the second half of 2024.
Meanwhile, gaming division Garena continued to show a decline in revenue and adjusted earnings. The segment’s full-year revenue was US$2.2 billion, down 44% from a year ago. Adjusted earnings dropped 30% to US$921 million as well.
Additionally, Garena’s quarterly revenue of US$511 million and adjusted earnings of US$217 million were the lowest of the four quarters in 2023.
Li, however, said its self-developed Free Fire was the most downloaded mobile game in 2023, according to data from market research firm Sensor Tower. He also said Garena was looking to grow the game’s user base and bookings by “double digits” in 2024.
Top line at SeaMoney, the group’s financial services business, continued to grow strongly. Revenue for 2023 as a whole was US$1.8 billion, 44% higher than a year ago, with its Q4 revenue of US$472 million up by 24% year on year.
SeaMoney posted its first-ever year of positive adjusted earnings, at US$550 million for 2023. Adjusted earnings of US$149 million for the quarter also marked a 96% surge compared to the same year-ago period. However, it was lower than the US$166 million it had posted for Q3, as sales and marketing spend doubled during Q4.
Li maintains that Sea Group sees a “significant upside” in its markets in the financial services space, and intends to continue investing in user acquisition “both on and off the Shopee platform” while remaining “prudent on risk management.”

Photo credit: Eat Just

US-based Eat Just, the company behind plant-based egg substitute Just Egg and cultivated meat brand Good Meat, has suspended operations in Singapore, The Straits Times reported.
The development follows a report from late 2023, which said that Eat Just was grappling with a US$100 million lawsuit from its bioreactor manufacturer in the US.
Regarding the suspension, the company is evaluating “various processing conditions, the unit economics, and a larger strategic approach to producing in Asia,” an Eat Just spokesperson told ST. 
While Eat Just did not specify when it will restart operations, it emphasized plans to produce at least twice the quantity in Singapore this year compared to any previous year.
Just Egg, which had Singaporeans lining up during its three-day pop-up launch in 2018, also appears to be put on hold as its plans to build the largest plant-protein factory in Singapore’s Pioneer area have been shelved.
The plans were bankrolled by a US$120 million investment by Eat Just and Proterra Investment Partners Asia – a private equity fund manager with expertise in agritech and foodtech. Significant investments like these are needed in the industry, as cell-based meat production can sometimes be several hundred times more expensive than traditional meat, Fengru Lin, founder and CEO of alternative proteins firm TurtleTree told Tech in Asia in the past.
Eat Just’s US$61 million facility in Bedok seems to have suffered the same fate. Workers from neighboring offices told ST that two units were rarely in operation in the last six months.
Eat Just formally entered Singapore in 2020 after getting approval to sell its products locally. It is backed by the likes of Alibaba-backed private equity firm C2 Capital Partners.

Hello reader,
Back in the day, I used to dabble a little in investing in bitcoin, if you can even call it “investing.” It was mostly just a little bit of speculation if I’m being honest, seeing as how crypto token prices looked like they were going “to the moon!”
As we know, things took a turn for the worse around 2021 when the price of tokens began to fall. Unsurprisingly, I took most of my money out of the market and haven’t really thought about getting back into it.
That’s why I was rather surprised to see mentions of bitcoin starting to creep up once again recently. What, pray tell, could it be this time? Is bitcoin really making a comeback?
I know better than to try my hand again at what’s essentially just gambling, but it was interesting to see that bitcoin has been on a rather strong upswing. Still, it’s almost a paltry improvement when compared to the growth that Web3 firm Block Solutions has experienced since 2019. Today’s story takes a look at just how astronomical it’s been.
Today we look at:

Block Solutions’ 33x growth in profit 
A US$1.25 million pre-seed round for a text-free social app
Other newsy highlights such as Nium’s new license in Japan and SCBX acquiring Home Credit Vietnam

Line go up, good. Line go up, investors happy. Line go up, more money. LINE GO UP. It seems that seeing a graph like this triggers some kind of caveman response in me – someone’s getting rich?! How can I be a part of that? I often have to stifle this temptation (looking at you, Nvidia), so let’s try to stay focused as I go through Block Solutions’ financials.


Big numbers go brrrr: In the last four financial years, the company’s profit after tax grew by over 33x. Additionally, its revenue jumped by over 22x in the last five financial years. 

Golden goose goes brrrr: Much of its success comes from its main product, Etherscan, an Ethereum blockchain explorer that’s become one of the world’s most well-known free Web3 utilities. Over 14 million users visit the site each month, and it’s the 56th most popular website for investing in the US. 

Good team go brrrr: Matthew Tan, owner of Block Solutions, attributes part of the company’s success to his team, which he says has a shared “culture of humility.”

Startup spotlight
Look ma, no text

Gimmick or a strong enough innovation to stand on its own? Singapore-based startup Drigmo has come up with Yolk.fm, a social media platform that’s meant to be text-free. It’ll be interesting to see whether it’ll stand the test of time, but it’s got some good omens already, including a US$1.25 million pre-seed round.


All in the face: Instead of text-based interactions, the Yolk.fm app lets users post images and react with AI-generated stickers of their faces. 

But wait, there’s more: Users can also add the reactions they get from their posts to what the platform calls a “profile fidget spinner,” which is a roulette of animated stickers. 

A feature, not a bug: The idea for Yolk.fm came about when the founding team noticed a glitch in Apple’s on-device segmentation and parsing tech, which was supposed to create photo cutouts but instead made a loop of a one-second video.

Photo credit: Wise

Fintech firm Wise has announced that it will be cutting support for its app’s e-wallet features in Indonesia, DailySocial.id reported.
The company, which operates as Wise Payments Indonesia in the country, has not obtained a relevant license from Indonesia’s central bank, the report mentioned. Under the 2018 Bank Indonesia regulation, such a license is a requirement for a company to provide electronic money offerings.
Still, the UK-based firm’s remittance services remain accessible to Indonesian users, Elian Ciptono, Wise’s country manager for Indonesia, told Tech in Asia.
Remittance has always been Wise Indonesia’s primary business, Ciptono noted. Local customers, he added, had access to the company’s multicurrency accounts and cards under a license for another Wise entity for a “selected period of time.” According to Ciptono, these services were offered under the central bank’s awareness.
“To avoid confusion about the services offered to customers in Indonesia, moving forward, only remittance services will be available to Indonesian customers,” he said. “As we grow, we hope to bring more products and services to Indonesia over time.”
Founded by Taavet Hinrikus and Kristo Käärmann in 2011, Wise allows users to send and receive money and offers a debit card feature. It entered Indonesia in 2020, now competing with players like Oy and Flip.
Since then, Wise has seen increased usage in the country, reaching nearly one million downloads in total on Google Play by February 2024.
Wise has also since partnered with Bank Mandiri to integrate its international money transfer services into the banking app Livin’.
In July 2021, the firm was listed on the London Stock Exchange at a valuation of US$11 billion.

Hello reader,
The science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke had it right when he wrote that “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”
After all, how many of us can even explain how smartphones work? Some of you probably have a stronger grasp on it, but I think I’m like most folks when something like ChatGPT enters the arena. We scratch our heads and go, “Must be magic.”
Clarke could have also been talking about the stock markets – sometimes, it sure feels like they move at the behest of supernatural forces. Share prices go up, down, side to side, and few people can divine why.
Take Grab (GRAB, Nasdaq), for example. Last week, the super app reported what it called a “strong set” of results for the fourth quarter of 2023, but its share price fell 8% in the trading session following the announcement. What gives? Shouldn’t a company that’s doing well perform better on the stock market?
Luckily, my colleague Simon has a better handle on the vagaries of the market than most. In today’s Big Story, he dives into the possible explanations for the discrepancy between Grab’s results and the market reaction. Spoiler alert: Magic is not a factor.

Why Grab’s shares declined despite its ‘strong’ Q4 results
Grab’s shares have underperformed US-listed peers like Uber and DoorDash over the past year despite having similar growth prospects.

3 Trends to keep an eye on
Hot stocks, earnings reports, restructuring, pressure from activist investors, and more.

1️⃣ 1+1 = Sell to TikTok: Occam’s razor is a complex philosophical concept, but when broken down to its essence, it suggests that the simplest explanation is usually the best one. This could apply to GoTo’s (GOTO, IDX) decision to give up a majority stake in its ecommerce arm, Tokopedia, to short-video app TikTok.
GoTo CEO Patrick Walujo attributed the move to a declining market share and “intense” competition in Indonesia’s ecommerce space. Speaking at a public event on February 28, Walujo also cited the “very large investment” needed for Tokopedia to compete against its well-funded rivals.
Now, instead of waging a costly incentives war, GoTo gains a revenue stream from the TikTok deal. Tokopedia will also pay an ecommerce service fee that’s an agreed-upon percentage of the combined firm’s gross merchandise value.
2️⃣ Coupang goes Gucci gang: South Korean ecommerce platform Coupang (CPNG, NYSE) enjoyed a bumper Q4 2023 result, with net revenue hitting US$6.6 billion, a 23% year-on-year increase.
Gross profit for the quarter also swelled 32% year-on-year to US$1.7 billion, with a gross profit margin of 25.6% – an improvement of 160 basis points.
But its developing offerings segment, which includes its international offerings and fintech businesses, reported a negative adjusted EBITDA of US$150 million in Q4 2023, jumping from -US$55 million in the same period the year before.
Coupang is also planning an expansion into the luxury goods segment following its acquisition of Farfetch, a UK-based luxury platform.
3️⃣ Baidu by the numbers: More good tidings this earnings season for China-based tech major Baidu (BIDU, Nasdaq) which reported a year-on-year increase in revenue and net profit in 2023.
The firm raked in US$19 billion in revenue in 2023, up 9% from the year prior. Net income hit US$2.9 billion in 2023, up 169% from the previous year. This marked a turnaround from 2022, when net income fell 26% compared to 2021.
In a sign of the times, Baidu is focusing more on generative AI and its AI chatbot service, Ernie. R&amp;D costs for 2023 rose 4% year on year to US$3.4 billion, primarily due to higher server expenses to support these efforts.

2 Eye-popping facts

100,000: The number of vehicles VinFast (VFS, Nasdaq) hopes to deliver in 2024. The Vietnam-based maker of electric vehicles delivered 34,855 units last year.


US$8.5 billion: The value of the merger between Disney’s (DIS, NYSE) Indian unit with local conglomerate Reliance Industries (RELIANCE, NSE). Not only will the move increase Reliance’s market share in the entertainment business, but it could also boost its advertising revenue.



The one you didn’t see coming
We spotlight the story that had everyone talking and social media buzzing during the past week.

Apples don’t make for good wheels: What’s the longest you’ve worked on a project only to see it scrapped? The answer is probably less than a decade, unless you worked on Apple’s (AAPL, Nasdaq) “Project Titan” from the start.
The tech titan has reportedly halted its decade-long effort to build an electric car. The 2,000 employees who were working to bring the project to the roads will move to Apple’s generative AI division, which may be quite a gear shift for some of them.
In typically magnanimous fashion, Tesla (TSLA, Nasdaq) CEO Elon Musk reacted to the demise of what could have been a rival by posting salute and smoking emojis.
Unfortunately, you do have to give it to Musk because he was right when he warned Apple in 2015 that “cars are very complex compared to phones or smartwatches.”

That’s it for this edition – we hope you liked it!

East Ventures and Temasek Foundation are switching it up for the second edition of the Climate Impact Innovations Challenge (CIIC) – a platform where startups and entrepreneurs in Indonesia can showcase their solutions that address ecological issues and climate change.
Just like last year, the 2024 CIIC has a total prize pool of 10 billion rupiah (US$636,000). However, the upcoming competition will focus on three new tracks: energy transition, sustainable agriculture, and circular economy.
These can be solutions that drive the adoption of renewable energy, enhance food production, and improve waste management processes, according to a statement.
Applications are open from March to June 2024. Finalists will be announced in July, with the program ending in September.
The 2023 CIIC saw “abundant enthusiasm and tangible impacts in the climate sector,” said Avina Sugiarto, partner at East Ventures.
Last year’s winners were AfterOil for the renewable energy category, Qarbotech for food and agriculture, Baniql for mobility, and Waste4Change for marine resources.
Earlier this year, East Ventures rolled out a greenhouse gas calculator for Indonesian businesses called Ecovisea. In October 2023, the VC firm launched a US$100 million fund targeting South Korean startups in sectors including greentech and future mobility.

839066,2024-03-04T04:00:35,2024-03-04T02:48:21,An ode to working mothers,ode-working-mothers,publish,post,https://www.techinasia.com/ode-working-mothers,"This article is part of Inspiring Inclusion, Tech in Asia’s campaign for International Women’s Day 2024, which ties in with our larger initiative to support women in tech by shining the spotlight on their stories, the impact they’ve had, and their achievements.

A year ago, I was in the early stages of my second pregnancy and went in for what should have been a routine scan to hear the baby’s heartbeat. Instead, I walked out devastated and in shock– no heartbeat could be detected and I had miscarried.
The timing of this news was tough, as we were just kicking off our roadshow for the Tech in Asia acquisition, and I had a packed calendar of calls and pitches. I needed to put on a good show, while quietly trying to emotionally, mentally, and physically process the miscarriage.
From there, the rest of 2023 unfolded on these parallel tracks.
Term sheets started rolling in mid-year, right about when I found out I was pregnant again. The due diligence process could be mapped to my first trimester, final negotiations happened during my second trimester, and we officially closed the deal as I kicked off my third trimester.
I assume that sparring with financial advisors and lawyers is annoying most of the time, but I can assure you it’s downright torture when you’re also fatigued and nauseated. And all of this was happening on top of the daily job of running Tech in Asia and chasing my toddler.
Fast forward to today, I’m nine months pregnant and should go into labor any day now (🤞). Our deal is done and we’re now deep into integration work with SPH Media. So really, all’s well that ends well.

Announcing our M&amp;A with SPH Media well into my second trimester (that’s why I’m hiding behind Wei Kong)

When I look back on the last year, I’m struck with gratitude for working at a company and with people that helped me maintain sanity during a crazy period. As I transition from one to two kids, I also know that given the increased complexity and costs of balancing things at home, many mothers tend to drop out of the workforce after having two kids.
This International Women’s Day (IWD), I’m reflecting on why I’ve felt so supported in my journey and how to pay it forward. In line with this year’s IWD theme of “Inspire Inclusion,”, I’m dedicating my note to some thoughts on what the “broken rung” is and what employers can do to inspire and include women – ultimately for the good of their own businesses.
The imperative to fix the broken rung
First of all, why do working moms matter?
Working moms make up a critical group that can help fix the broken rung in women’s rise to leadership. The stats definitively show that more women are dropping out of the workforce in the middle of their careers, so by the time one is looking at talent for senior leadership roles, the pipeline of women is not robust enough.
What starts as relative parity for entry level positions (52% men, 47% women) quickly becomes an increasingly cavernous gap, according to the 2023 Women in the Workplace study. At the manager level, the ratio changes to 60% men, 40% women, and by the time you get to the rung below C-level, that turns into a 73% men, 28% women gap.

Giving the welcome address at TIA Conference 2023 at three months pregnant

Of course, the next question is, why aren’t women making it through the manager, vice president, and senior vice president levels? On this one, you get a tangle of answers. There is often talk about the motherhood penalty, where mothers see a larger pay gap as compared to fathers, the hidden costs of caregiving – which were exacerbated by the pandemic – and of course the general lack of flexible work arrangements from companies across the board.
My sense is that once women have kids, the decision calculus for moms changes in a way that it doesn’t for fathers. In general, one’s time becomes more precious. Then, the expectations for one’s job increases in order to compensate for that trade-off in time. Jobs that were “good enough” may no longer be, as women say no to unfulfilling or underpaid roles, toxic workplaces, and employers who don’t support their career progression. Financial considerations for childcare costs in most countries just reinforce this conclusion.
The economic costs of this decision calculus, being made millions of times around the world, is significant. Studies indicate that having fewer women in the workforce costs the US economy approximately US$650 billion each year, or potentially US$28 trillion on a global level. At the company level, individual firms with greater “gender diversity on executive teams were 25% more likely to have above-average profitability than companies in the fourth quartile.” This holds true for startups, where female founders delivered up to twice the revenue for every dollar invested.
Each and every company has a major incentive to keep as many women in their workforce as possible and grow through the ranks of leadership. Until the broken rung is fixed, we’re forever dealing with a vicious cycle. Not enough women in positions of leadership leads to less female investors, which cascades into fewer female founders and, subsequently, employees, where this sad song begins again.
Mending the broken rung is a step out of this self-inflicted cycle.
My personal cost-benefit analysis for being a working mom
Last year was one of the toughest years I’ve experienced to date, both personally and professionally. Under different circumstances, like at one of the large multinationals I used to work for, I could easily see myself saying that the job wasn’t worth the stress and choosing to take a break to focus on myself and my family. Of course, thousands of moms every day are doing exactly that. They are saying that the juice isn’t worth the squeeze, and they are leaving the workforce rather than continuing to put up with unfulfilling jobs.

A special guest to our office! I was sans childcare for a week and had to solo-parent and work full-time.

Yet, it doesn’t have to be this way. Tech in Asia has made my decision to stay in the workforce easy – rewarding, even – because it delivers what I need to feel supported and motivated to keep working:


Impact. As measured on two levels: First is the belief that I’m creating an impact in my own role, and second is a belief in my company’s impact in the world. You want to have one, but preferably both.

Flexibility. As defined by having flexibility over your own time and projects. Of course, we can’t pick and choose all of our projects (it is called work, after all), but some control over where you are investing your time makes a difference.

Empathy. Finally, it’s amazing for your workplace to have some empathy and understanding of what you’re juggling. Luckily, at TIA, a lot of our leaders have kids of their own, so I’m grateful to work with people who understand that the #parentstruggle is real. Our founder and CEO, Willis Wee, was one of the first people to know about my miscarriage and was incredibly supportive throughout the M&amp;A process to make sure that I was taking care of myself.

For me, these three factors tip any cost-benefit analysis well over the line to “keep working.” Of course, everyone has their own list and should calibrate for themselves what they need to make their own situation work. Once you figure it out, proactively work with your employer to explain what you need but also what you’ll be able to deliver as a result. You’ll want to be able to spell out a win-win situation for the company.
Why startups are in pole position to benefit from working moms
To switch hats and approach the issue from my COO capacity, I think about how every company can provide such a supportive environment for working mothers. Luckily, the formula is right in line withbuilding a great company culture:


Support parental leave. At a minimum, mothers need three months. If you can offer more (or are obligated by local regulations), do it. Don’t discriminate between different tiers or types of employees. And finally, don’t be a scrooge about leave – let the employee take it whenever, wherever, and however they want.

Honor flexible work. Give employees the space to work whenever and from wherever they want and track them based on outcomes, rather than input. This has luckily become more prevalent after Covid-19, but I still see people bastardize the concept all the time. They claim to have flexible work arrangements but expect people to respond to emails or messages within minutes or set up rigid call schedules.

Plot out career paths and progression. Women’s ambitions don’t just disappear when they become moms. But they will wither and fade after years spent in unsatisfying or meaningless jobs. Every employer and manager should be working with each employee on a plan that works for them and gives them a chance to make an impact. This is true for everyone, but especially working moms who have a lot more to juggle.

Set the tone from the top. The entire Tech in Asia team has seen our leadership team navigate our own challenges of raising children while still balancing a full workload. As leaders, we know how we want our own time and impact to be measured, so it’s easy to treat others accordingly.

The good news is that most well-run startups are in pole position to tap into this working mom talent pool. Startups already tend to attract those who care about the mission and impact, track employee performance by outcomes rather than inputs, and have flexible work arrangements in place. It frankly seems like an amazing opportunity for startups to pull in a lot of great talent that they otherwise might not be able to access or afford.
Our 2024 IWD campaign
For International Women’s Day this year, Tech in Asia continues to celebrate and highlight the impact of women in our tech and startup community.

As always, we’re shining the spotlight on the experiences of women in our community through detailed visual stories and in-depth, personal conversations. We’re also pushing our creative capabilities this year, with a short mockumentary series – to be released on our social media channels – illustrating the valuable role women play in the workplace.
Women are still woefully lacking in leadership positions and on stage, so let me also highlight our semi-regular update of the Women in Power List. This is my personal compilation of women founders, C-level executives, and investors who should be top of mind if you’re looking for potential executives, board members, investors, speakers, and more. I’m excited that we now have over 200 names on this list, so no more excuses!
Employers, if you feel like your pipeline of female talent is too thin, it’s probably your own fault. I would urge everyone to take a long, hard look at your HR policies and how they impact women, especially at the middle management level.
Working moms are a valuable resource. Mending the broken rung in your company could reap real economic benefits and drive more inclusion and diversity in our ecosystem – which can only be for the better.","Why working moms matter, what the “broken rung” is, and what employers can do to inspire and include them.",Maria Li,"Editing by Stefanie Yeo, Winston Zhang, and Jaclyn Tiu",open,0,"",https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1709254204_iwd-24-web_1200x675-maria.png,false,"",false,true,false,true,false,8,,1900,An ode to working mothers,"Why working moms matter, what the “broken rung” is, and what employers can do to inspire and include them.",,,"","",""

Online property portal PropertyGuru posted a net income of S$1.1 million (roughly US$820,000) for the fourth quarter of 2023, reversing from a net loss of about US$3.9 million a year prior and marking the second consecutive quarter of positive earnings.
This came as revenue for the quarter rose 3.5% to US$30.9 million from US$29.8 million in Q4 2022, on the back of growth in its Singapore marketplaces.
Adjusted EBITDA surged to US$6.6 million from US$374,000 in the corresponding period last year.
Marketplaces revenue increased 4.1% year on year to US$29.7 million, as a strong performance in its Singapore market helped to offset challenging market conditions in Vietnam, said PropertyGuru.
Earnings per share for the period stood at roughly US$0.0074, reversing from a loss per share of US$0.022 a year ago.
For the full year, net loss narrowed 88.2% to US$11.4 million, while revenue increased 10.5% to US$111.6 million.
“Despite less-than-favorable market conditions in Vietnam and Malaysia, we were able to achieve these results by being laser-focused on optimizing costs, adopting internal process automation, improving code quality and productivity,” said Hari Krishnan, CEO and managing director of PropertyGuru.

On February 27, the group announced that it would lay off 79 employees, or 5% of its workforce, as part of a strategic review to “future-proof” the business in volatile markets. It is also closing two out of nine branches in Vietnam relating to its marketplace business.
Joe Dische, PropertyGuru’s CFO, highlighted that all of the company’s markets – Singapore, Malaysia, and Vietnam – recorded positive adjusted EBITDA. He also noted that corporate expenses as a percentage of overall revenue decreased to 37% in 2023 from 39% in 2022.
“Looking to 2024, we will continue to focus on expanding internal operating leverage as we look to improve profitability,” he said. “We are introducing a full-year 2024 revenue outlook of US$122.7 million to US$133.9 million and a full-year adjusted EBITDA outlook of US$16.4 million to US$19.3 million.”
Vietnam continues to pose a challenge for PropertyGuru, as the government continues to restabilize the property market following anti-corruption and credit-accessibility issues that evolved into consumer-credit concerns in 2023. Dische highlighted that cost-management actions have helped improve adjusted EBITDA margins to 13%, despite a drop in revenue.
While Grab has announced a US$500 million share buyback program, PropertyGuru has not considered such an initiative so far, said Dische. The money raised from the company’s listing was to pursue potential M&amp;A opportunities, such as its purchase of home services provider Sendhelper.
“For now, we are pursuing our M&amp;A strategy. We’ll obviously monitor the market and reappraise as time goes on,” he said.
Dische added that PropertyGuru will continue to hire selectively and focus investments into innovation and automation plays, including generative AI.
“Going forward, we’re moving to a more sustainable level of profitability, powered by the future-proofing of our core business model and target investments to deliver long-term growth,” he said.

One of the most common signs of “adulting” – as the kids like to say these days – is being responsible not just for your own well-being but also for those that you support.
With the cost of living skyrocketing and issues like housing prices weighing down more heavily than ever, there’s often little room for error when it comes to financial well-being.
Insurance plays a key role here. In the event of a mishap, the coverage extends to making up for the loss of income or ensuring that medical bills don’t end up being a burden.
As such, there’s a significant amount of people that sign up for some form of coverage, especially in Singapore. In 2021, the country’s total insurance penetration rate stood at 9.3%, making it one of the highest in Asia Pacific.
For insurance firms, engaging this huge customer base means that their processes need to be as optimized as possible so that they can offer the best experience.
In the case of Prudential Singapore, this manifests as a range of tech-enabled services. Here’s a look at what goes on behind the scenes – from processing an application for an insurance plan to paying for a claim – to make insurance hassle-free.

Their comments come in the wake of the long-awaited Power Development Plan VIII, which was given the green light last year to shift the country’s power generation mix away from coal and toward renewables such as hydrogen and ammonia.
“The lack of green finance sources and support policies from the government has undermined customers’ confidence,” Trinh Viet Dung, CTO of Vietnam-based battery developer Cenergy, tells The Business Times. “For imports of bulky battery systems in large quantities, there are high upfront costs and shipping fees.”

Many startups are counting on home-grown battery technologies to harness Vietnam’s abundant renewable energy resources as they hold out for more robust incentives.
Under the new power strategy, the country is targeting a total capacity of at least 2,700 megawatts (MW) for pumped storage hydropower and other battery storage sources by 2030 and 30,650 MW by 2050.
Industrial energy storage
Cenergy is hoping that its efforts to develop vanadium redox flow batteries – which store energy in liquid electrolytes containing vanadium ions – will lead to the tech becoming popular in the market.
These batteries have several benefits over their counterparts such as higher energy, longer lifespan, and no problems of overcharging.

They have been used alongside electrical grids and power plants in other countries, says Dung.
Bringing the technology closer to Vietnam by employing locally sourced materials and setting up a large-scale production facility could cut prices by up to 30%, he adds.

This is expected to result in greater interest from industrial clients, given how electricity prices in the country are forecast to rise by 3% annually, he says.
Such a vision, however, requires hefty financing. According to Dung, Cenergy’s operations, production, and commercialization of 200 MW in annual battery storage capacity would need US$10 million to US$20 million in capital by 2025.
Reducing cost of EV batteries
Data from the International Energy Agency show that transportation currently accounts for about 30% of global energy use, besides electricity (20%) and heat (50%).
As such, Vietnam’s battery startups have their eyes on the technologies being developed by VinFast, the country’s leading carmaker, as it aims to bring the prices of its electric vehicles further down to appeal to a wider base.
According to a report by Visual Capitalist, the cost of a battery varies from 13% to 32% of the total cost of an EV, depending on the composition and metals used.

Boston Consulting Group pointed out in an analysis that the manufacturing of battery cells takes the lion’s share of the total profits derived from the entire lithium-ion battery supply chain, which also includes raw material extraction and chemical production.
However, cell manufacturing has proven to be a tough nut to crack.
VinFast – in which parent firm Vingroup and its billionaire founder has pumped in nearly US$10 billion to date – has mainly integrated imported cells into its rechargeable battery packs.
“Given the value of the battery within an EV and the sensitivity of the supply chain, all original equipment manufacturers should aim to vertically integrate their own battery supply chain,” says Lukas Neckermann, managing director of Neckermann Strategic Advisors, a London-based consultancy focused on the mobility sector.
With logistics and packaging making up less than 10% of the cost of an EV battery, he suggested that more carmakers consider alternative ways to maximize their profits.

“VinFast has already embraced the more cost-effective lithium ferro-phosphate (LFP) batteries and is expanding production capacity dramatically, so it’s clear they will get some gains there,” says Neckermann.
After acquiring its battery-maker sibling VinES last October, VinFast will produce LFP battery cells from the third quarter of this year following a joint venture with China-based battery maker Gotion.
Even with such advancements, VinFast has constantly sought new funding sources to develop its battery-making capabilities.
In December 2023, the firm announced its formal application to the Development Financial Corporation for a US$500 million loan to establish a lithium-ion battery manufacturing facility in Vietnam.
VinFast has also expanded battery production to countries such as India and Indonesia. The company said that this gives it access to government incentives for local manufacturing, relief from certain tariffs, and access to raw materials at attractive rates.
Thermal energy storage
Another underserved market that Vietnam’s energy startups are exploring is thermal energy storage for heating.
Alterno, based in Ho Chi Minh City, uses a mixture of sand and a small amount of its “trade secret” ingredients to enable high-temperature thermal energy storage of up to 600 degree Celsius captured from renewable sources.
Sand batteries were first invented to power the central heating systems for European districts, replacing carbon-intensive fossil fuel sources such as coal and gas.

Vietnam, which is among the world’s largest suppliers of rice and coffee beans, could adopt emission-free heating systems for processing export-oriented agricultural products, says Alterno co-founder Ho Viet Hai.

“Converting heat to heat (with thermal energy storage systems) is always more effective than converting electricity to heat,” Hai tells The Business Times, estimating that customers could recoup the system costs in about four years.
“The sand we use is abundant and found at beaches and deserts, which is distinct from the scarcer type of sand used in construction,” he adds.
Claiming to be the world’s first producer of sand batteries dedicated to agriculture, Alterno has a goal of achieving a 25% share of agricultural heating supply by 2030, with its primary markets being Vietnam, Indonesia, and South Africa.
“Our most pressing need is to collaborate with more green financing providers to ease the financial burden for clients and accelerate the green transition of industries,” Hai says.

Hi readers,
If you had asked me 10 years ago what my biggest fear was, I would’ve said the sight of beehives. But now that I’m the main provider for my family, the thought of unemployment terrifies me the most.
This fear is exacerbated by seeing how some of my friends are struggling to pay off loan sharks, who can charge interest rates as high as 30% a month. These sharks will even go to borrowers’ houses and yell at them  when collection time comes, and they must hand over the money to avoid social humiliation.
The exorbitant rates of loan sharks stand in stark contrast to peer-to-peer online lenders in Indonesia, which previously charged as high as 12% a month or 0.4% a day. Despite this, borrowers still struggled with repayments, leading Indonesia’s financial authority – Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (OJK) – to cut interest rates to a more manageable range of 0.1 to 0.3% daily.
However, the debt collection practices of online lenders are no less intense, often involving incessant phone calls and texts. Some borrowers have reported receiving threats and being verbally abused as collectors resort to tactics such as sending fake deliveries to their homes and coercing them to pay for these orders.
As interest rates are lowered to reduce high default rates – an ongoing issue under scrutiny from OJK – online lending platforms may find themselves operating in less risky segments, which in turn will shrink their market.
OJK is also increasing the minimum equity requirement and paid-up capital for these platforms and has instructed banks to cease lending to platforms facing defaults in repayments. That will only heap more pressure on the industry.

Hello reader,
During one Sports Day in primary school, I participated in a “novelty race.” Basically, this was an event that also used props as part of the race; for example, you had to balance a beanbag on your head as you ran.
Anyway, I was on course to finish second, but because I decided to hop and stop on the finish line instead of running right through, I was judged to have finished third (the person behind me ran through). It didn’t really bother me at the time, but in hindsight, that was a bit of a waste, wasn’t it?
I bring this up because just a mere US$1 million separates the top two funded firms in today’s newsletter. I expect they don’t actually care, especially since they closed big-money deals – this is really just me taking the opportunity to reminisce about my childhood a little bit.
Anyway, you can find all other important investment deals that happened in the last few days in our weekly funding news wrap-up.

Let’s dive into the biggest deals and M&amp;As that recently took place.

The biggest deals by market
🇸🇬 Capillary Technologies is a Singaporean firm that develops AI-powered, digital technologies and retail customer relationship management solutions. It secured US$140 million in series D funding from 57 Stars, Avataar Ventures, and Filter Capital, among others.
🇨🇳 Based in China, Unitree Robotics is a robot developer. It closed a US$139 million series B funding round, with investors including the likes of China Internet Investment Fund, Dunhong Capital, and GoldStone Investment.
🇮🇳 Indian logistics startup Shadowfax, which offers last-mile delivery solutions focused on online-first brands, has secured US$100 million in series E funding. TPG NewQuest led the round, while ecommerce giant Flipkart also participated.
🇰🇷 Flexcil, the South Korean company that developed a note-taking and PDF reader app, has received US$37.5 million in early-stage funding from Crescendo Equity Partners.
🇮🇩 Sun Energy is a solar project developer in Indonesia. It got US$32 million in debt financing from Bank Permata.

Thoughtful reads
1️⃣ After zero to one, comes one to many
Most startups begin with offering one key solution, but this can very quickly become several as a company gets to know its clientele better and aims to solve multiple pain points. This First Round Review article features a former Stripe product manager as she takes us through the process of going “multi-product.”
2️⃣ When empathy goes too far
It’s now well-known that a firm describing its culture as “like a family” is a bit of a red flag – but even in the most professional of settings, humans still work with humans, and feelings and emotions are a natural part of any such ecosystem.
Empathy for colleagues is important, but we should all be careful of being emotionally manipulated into doing anything that’s detrimental to our personal well-being. This piece on Harvard Business Review (HBR) explains further.
3️⃣ Get AI to help hire your next great employee
I firmly believe that AI tools can help us work better, and that appears to be the case in hiring as well, if this Sifted article is any indication.

4️⃣ Spilling the tea with Klarna
Last week, Sequoia Capital partner Matt Miller, with the support of his firm, asked Klarna’s shareholders to remove Michael Moritz, Sequoia’s former chairperson, from the fintech company’s board.
Then on Tuesday, the VC firm withdrew its request and apologized, and two days later, it replaced Miller with Andrew Reed as board member.

5️⃣ Don’t be hasty when thinking of changing jobs
In a climate where the threat of layoffs looms large (and sometimes just straight up happens), many people are being a little more “mobile” in their thinking when it comes to their career. But before you make any drastic changes, it’s best to be educated about it.

Now, that’s all changed. Vietnam’s come up on the global stage on all fronts, and its startup scene in particular is in the limelight. Some investors are seeing it as the third major startup market in Southeast Asia, after Singapore and Indonesia.

Here at Tech in Asia, we’re keen on Vietnam and the opportunities it holds. That’s why we’re running Saigon Summit, an exciting gathering of tech enthusiasts meant to uncover the country’s tech potential, in May this year.
Let’s take a closer look at what’s going on with Vietnam.
Where we’re at
According to Startup Bink, Vietnam ranks fifth among Southeast Asian startup markets in 2023. Additionally, Ho Chi Minh City is on Startup Genome’s list of 100 emerging ecosystems.
Looking at funding data, the country has seen startup investments rise consistently since 2018, peaking at US$1.9 billion in 2021.

Funding into Vietnamese startups took a hit in 2022, in line with the larger funding winter. However, in the second half of the year, despite the overall drop in funding amount, there was an uptick in deal count compared to H1 2022, which indicates that investment activity is still healthy.
The downward trend continued in 2023, with Vietnamese startups raising just US$541 million. However, Vietnam was also still one of the most funded startup ecosystems in Southeast Asia last year, coming in third after Singapore and Indonesia, according to Tech in Asia data. This is a reflection of where investor interest lies and of the opportunities that they see in the market.
As of October 2023, Vietnam is home to four unicorns: VNG, which operates messaging app Zalo and e-wallet ZaloPay, payments platform MoMo, VNLife, which is the owner of payment firm VNPay, and blockchain gaming startup Sky Mavis.
Other notable startups that have emerged from the nation include ecommerce platforms Tiki and Sendo, financial services company F88, and electric vehicle firm VinFast, which listed on the Nasdaq in 2023.
Coming up next
Many investors and businesses have their eye on Vietnam, especially as tensions continue to mount between the US and China. The country’s position as a global manufacturing hub for both traditional sectors and the tech industry is expected to strengthen through the “China plus one” strategy, where foreign firms seek to diversify their manufacturing capabilities.

Vietnam benefits as well from having a relatively young and tech-savvy population. It’s also known for having a strong base of affordable and talented engineers, putting it in a prime position for tech and startup development.
Here are some key verticals that we anticipate will see significant growth in Vietnam on the road ahead:

Fintech: 79% of people in Vietnam are unbanked or underbanked. E-wallets have become popular in the country, with MoMo and ZaloPay pulling ahead as leaders in the space. The lending sector in the country will be an exciting market – it is expected to have a compound annual growth rate of 56% from 2022 to 2025. There’s certainly opportunities for startups to drive greater financial inclusion in the country.
Electric vehicles: VinFast’s listing on the Nasdaq has captured global attention. Vietnam’s EV scene is heating up, with firms like Selex Motors and DatBike joining the fray. The Vietnamese government has also announced a slate of measures to drive EV adoption and growth in the country, providing fertile ground for the industry to flourish even further.
Web3: Vietnamese citizens are quite open to blockchain and digital assets. Around 6% of the population owned some form of crypto asset in 2022, and a survey by Decision Lab found that 53% of respondents expect to invest more in crypto in 2023. This makes the asset the second most popular means of investment, coming only behind traditional savings. The Vietnamese government is also keen on blockchain, having launched the Vietnam Blockchain Union, a legal entity that aims to develop the local ecosystem.

V is for Vietnam
While Vietnam is certainly coming up in the startup world, founders in the country also grapple with challenges around regulatory uncertainty and a lack of experienced tech talent. They contend with larger infrastructural difficulties and socioeconomic inequality as well.
For those able to navigate these waters, Vietnam represents a significant opportunity. At Saigon Summit, we’re aiming to chart the country’s tech future. The event will bring together founders, investors, and business leaders to exchange ideas and share insights on unearthing Vietnam’s growing tech and startup potential.
Held on May 30 at GEM Centre in Ho Chi Minh City, Saigon Summit will feature insightful sharings from some of the region’s biggest movers and shakers, networking and exhibition segments, as well as opportunities to experience the country’s rich and colorful cultural scene through satellite events.

We’re looking forward to an exciting time in Vietnam, and we hope you’ll join us for the affair. Tickets for Saigon Summit are now on sale, and we’re running a limited-time promotion where tickets start from just US$35 (U.P. US$60) for a General Pass. Be sure to get your ticket before it’s too late.

Founded in 2015 by Sam Altman, Elon Musk, and others, OpenAI was a nonprofit AI research lab that challenged the profit-driven model of big tech.
However, most of the OpenAI’s models are now closed source, contradicting the company’s own name.
This is part of the reason why Elon Musk is taking legal action against OpenAI, its co-founders Sam Altman and Greg Brockman, and related bodies, TechCrunch reported.
The lawsuit he filed says that the company has deviated from its original goal of using AI for the global good, and is instead chasing profit – allegedly breaching the founders’ contractual agreement.
A key point of the lawsuit is GPT-4, OpenAI’s recent natural language model. Musk believes that this system is essentially artificial general intelligence (AGI), and alleges that OpenAI and its commercial ally Microsoft have wrongly licensed it.
Notably, Musk launched his own AI chatbot last year, called Grok AI, which feeds on real-time information from his social media platform X (formerly Twitter).
Nevertheless, the lawsuit also takes issue with the restructuring of OpenAI’s board. According to Musk, Altman chose new board members who lack the “technical expertise or any substantial background in AI governance” that the previous board commanded.
Provided the court finds that OpenAI is presently operating for personal profit, the Tesla CEO is demanding potential refunds of donations initially provided for public-interest research.

ShopBack, a Singapore-headquartered loyalty platform, has announced that it will be discontinuing its buy now, pay later (BNPL) service PayLater.
In an email to customers in the city-state, the company said that it will discontinue the service from March 22. This will apply to both online and physical transactions.
The PayLater service was introduced after ShopBack acquired BNPL player Hoolah back in November 2021. The offering was rolled out in July 2022 to Singapore and Malaysia.
When contacted by The Business Times, ShopBack said that it is also discontinuing the PayLater service in Malaysia. The shuttering of PayLater is part of a periodic review of its business units.
“Our decision to discontinue the PayLater feature in Singapore and Malaysia is driven by our strategic focus on sustainable business models with strong potential for growth,” said the company.
A number of players have shuttered over the last year in the BNPL space, with Singapore-based Pace the most recent to close shop. It filed for voluntary winding up back in August 2023.

India-based Paytm and its associate Paytm Payments Bank are set to terminate intercompany agreements, a move that would simplify the former’s corporate structure and give the payments bank more independent operations.
After the announcement, which took place earlier today, the fintech giant’s stock grew by over 4%.
Paytm launched the bank in 2017 after receiving a license to run a payments bank from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) – the country’s central bank – in the same year. Paytm Payments Bank offers services like savings accounts and business banking.
Recently, however, RBI had instructed Paytm Payments Bank to halt activities due to compliance issues regarding know-your-customer processes as well as money-laundering concerns. It granted Paytm Payments Bank until March 15 to wind down operations, with its license set to be revoked on April 1.
Following the freeze, Reuters reported that the payments bank was also being probed by the Enforcement Directorate, the Indian government agency that investigates economic crimes and financial fraud.
The probe sent Paytm’s share price tumbling by over 42% within three days.
It was later revealed that SoftBank Group had sold a major chunk of its stake in Paytm just before the central bank imposed sanctions.
However, RBI’s decision to allow ongoing UPI transactions on Paytm’s app helped the company recover from a record decline in shares in mid-February.

Hello reader,
Just a few weeks ago, I wrote that I found it interesting that firms like StashAway, Endowus, and Syfe – which help users save and grow their finances – can operate at a loss.
Of course, this is nothing new or alarming in the startup and tech world, but with the traditional “profit = good, loss = bad” thought process, it’s just a bit of funny tortured logic to me that a company that isn’t making money itself is tasked with making money for others.
But this may all change soon. Today’s premium article looks at how these wealth management companies are gunning for profitability.
Today we look at:

How digital wealth platforms are plotting their paths to profitability

The main reason behind the Tokopedia-TikTok deal
Other newsy highlights such as the US$100 million funding round of an Indian logistics startup and GudangAda’s insistence that it’s not winding down operations any time soon

Life lessons from wealth management firms

Image credit: Timmy Loen

I suppose the paradox of wealth management firms operating at a loss is a kind of metaphor for life. Everyone is flawed in some form or another, but we keep trying to live our best lives and to help those around us do so as well.
I think that’s a good lesson – as long as these firms actually aim to reach profitability at some point and are not just content to burn investor money chasing unsustainable growth.


Helping more people: Wealth management platforms StashAway, Syfe, and Endowus saw a bump in their assets under management in 2023, as new product rollouts attracted more commitments, mainly from existing clients.

Still red marks: While players say business is growing, they have yet to be profitable. For example, financial reports for Endowus show revenue growing 151.5% to S$8.3 million (US$6.2 million) in 2022. However, its losses also swelled 51.4% to S$26.8 million (US$19.9 million) in the same period.

Doubling down: For 2024, the firms are eschewing expansion plans in favor of concentrating on the markets they’re already in.

A matter of necessity

GoTo Group chief Patrick Walujo said that Tokopedia‘s market share has been diminishing – especially among price-conscious consumers – as the group cut down on incentives to achieve profitability.
That, along with the “very intense” competition in the Indonesian ecommerce space, led to the TikTok acquisition, which was completed last month.


That’s a big difference: According to data revealed at a recent public expose event, Tokopedia has 18 million monthly active users (MAUs). That’s a far cry from the 100 million it previously said it had, though the calculation methods may be different.

Big boost: Meanwhile, TikTok Shop has 125 million MAUs in Indonesia. That said, its estimated Indonesia gross merchandise value (GMV) for 2023, at US$6 billion, is still lower than Tokopedia’s US$15.6 billion. 

Profit-sharing model: While the move lets TikTok Shop resume operations in Indonesia, GoTo Group will also receive an ongoing revenue stream – in the form of an ecommerce service fee – from Tokopedia. In the public expose document, GoTo said that it will take an agreed-upon percentage from the combined entity’s GMV.

1️⃣ Here to stay
Indonesian B2B ecommerce company GudangAda has “categorically denied” that it has any plans for winding down operations in the short term. According to a statement, the company “remains operational” and is diversifying into new categories, such as beauty and personal care, that have shown promise.
The statement comes after DealStreetAsia reported that GudangAda’s board is mulling options that include winding down operations. The board is also reportedly considering returning capital to investors as it deliberates on the business’ future, though it has not made a decision, the report said.
2️⃣ Baby business is big business
KeaBabies,a Singapore-based baby products company, hit revenue of US$58 million in 2023, its co-founder and CEO Ivan Ong said. According to Ong’s LinkedIn post, the amount is an increase from US$37 million of revenue in 2022.
Without disclosing specifics, Ong told Tech in Asia that KeaBabies continued to be profitable in 2023 with double-digit net profit margins. The firm, which is bootstrapped, first turned a profit in its sixth month of operations.

Photo credit: T. Schneider / Shutterstock

Neil Shen, the head of Chinese VC firm HongShan (previously Sequoia China), reportedly became a permanent resident of Singapore prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, sources told the Financial Times.
One of the sources said that Shen – who was an early investor in Alibaba and Shein – had requested to move his residency a decade ago.
This adds to recent news of Chinese elite moving residencies to the city-state, including Alibaba co-founder James Sheng. There have been reports saying that Chinese tycoons have been quick to turn to Singapore to protect their wealth.
Shen’s shift in residency also comes before the split of VC firm Sequoia Capital, which was announced in June 2023. This created three separate entities: Sequoia Capital (US and Europe), Peak XV Partners (India and Southeast Asia), and HongShan (China).
Since this split, HongShan has opened up a local office in Singapore. In a statement to the Financial Times, the investment firm said it expanded into the city-state strictly for “business reasons,” including fulfilling local laws.
At the time of the split, Sequoia had US$56 billion in assets under management (AUM) in China. In comparison, it had US$53 billion AUM across both the US and Europe.

Singapore-based Tonik Financial, which operates Tonik Digital Bank in the Philippines, has laid off a number of its employees as it seeks to boost revenue and achieve profitability.
The company retrenched “a few fixed positions that are not essential to supporting the company’s objectives going forward,” founder and CEO Greg Krasnov told Tech in Asia via an email.
While the exec did not disclose how many were laid off, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Tech in Asia that there were 80 positions affected across units.
In his statement, Krasnov added that the company’s lending products have hit unit profitability and that the firm is now aiming for group profitability.
This comes after Tonik increased both its consolidated loan portfolio and headcount in 2023, rising 201% and 45%, respectively, according to Krasnov. It also reduced its net cash burn by 33% last year, he added, without disclosing actual figures.
In 2022, the company had total comprehensive losses of US$37.6 million, with wages and salaries expenses reaching US$10.6 million, according to Alternatives.pe, which tracks regulatory filings. Meanwhile, net interest income grew 5.7x from 2021.
Krasnov said that Tonik intends to “redeploy resources into direct support” of its growth, expecting further improvements in its loan portfolio and revenue. The company hopes this will drive “a double-digit growth in overall headcount before year-end,” he added.
Launched in 2021, Tonik Financial increased its headcount to nearly 600 by January 2023.
“Risk is part of our daily business,” Krasnov told Tech in Asia at the time. “We need to assess where we can allocate our resources so we minimize the risk and optimize profitability.”

Hey there,
Mike Tyson once famously said that everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.
The boxer was speaking literally about the sweet science, but it’s a phrase that can be applied to all walks of life. Indian waste management startups seem to have been experiencing its truth all too literally.
Today’s Deep Read looks into the challenges these firms are facing from local gangs who already have a foothold in the scrap collection industry. As with all endeavors, what matters isn’t your plan going in, but how you overcome adversity.
— Peter

THE BIG STORIES
1️⃣ Frustrations in insect-for-food industry spark pivot

Photo credit: Faizal Afnan / Shutterstock

Insect farming as an industry may be most closely associated with alternative proteins, but startups in the space across Southeast Asia are seeking more fertile ground in the production of insect-derived ingredients for health supplements and animal feed.
Given the regulatory challenges around providing insects as food and the still unsolved question of product-market fit, the buzz around this industry’s potential to be a solution for food shortages has quietened lately.
2️⃣ Anywheel defies odds to survive Singapore’s bike-sharing wars
By having the largest fleet among bicycle-sharing firms in Singapore, bootstrapped startup Anywheel has fought off competition from investor-backed competitors to survive in the city-state.
Besides helping reduce the number of trips taken via engined vehicles, Anywheel also offers advertising services, which are more eco-friendly than traditional adverts on cars, buses, or even electronic billboards.

DEEP READ
Waste management startups want to turn trash into cash, but garbage mafia stymie growth

Image credit: Timmy Loen

By one estimate, India’s waste management sector was worth US$12.9 billion last year. Informal scrap-collecting groups have a piece of that pie, and they don’t feel like giving it up to waste management startups.
This report details the “garbage mafia” gangs that threaten and intimidate formal collectors, including startups, to hold onto their business. These illegal scrap-trading groups operate in a pretty traditional manner by hiring manual scavengers from economically disadvantaged backgrounds.
This creates a black market where manual laborers work in unsafe environments. Local authorities, too, loathe to get involved, lest they draw the ire of the garbage mafia.
These problems have discouraged VCs from investing in Indian waste management startups. Fortunately, there may be a path for firms in the sector to find success, as some have found ways around the problems, like working directly with waste pickers.

1️⃣ ‘A Trojan horse of legitimacy’: Shell launches a ‘climate tech’ startup advertising jobs in oil and gas
Called Onward, the startup launched in February with an aim to “advance the energy transition.” However, this report by Drilled and The Guardian reveals that the Shell-owned company’s website is largely focused on improving oil and gas outcomes, with a job board featuring dozens of postings in the oil and gas industry.
Why it matters:
Shell profited to the tune of US$28 billion last year largely thanks to oil and gas sales.
Any suspected greenwashing by such companies should be called out if we ever want them to actually contribute to the energy transition.
2️⃣ The false promise of carbon capture as a climate solution
Oil and gas firms have long been proponents of carbon capture and storage, which involves trapping carbon dioxide emissions in the ground – a method that, in theory, stops them from impacting the atmosphere. However, as this article explores, scientists are skeptical about how feasible this solution is with the technology currently at hand.
Why it matters:
If time is of the essence in the fight to save our planet (and many experts say it is), wasting time, money, and effort into suboptimal solutions is a big problem.
3️⃣ VinFast to build $500m EV factory in India
The Vietnamese electric vehicle manufacturer has broken ground on its new factory in India. VinFast has committed to investing US$500 million for the first phase of the integrated EV factory, spanning five years from the kickoff.
Why it matters:
If EVs are to have the environmental impact many hope for, the world’s most populous country has to buy in. More EV options for Indian consumers could help spur adoption.
4️⃣ BYD rejects EU claims subsidies help reduce price of China-made cars
Chinese EV maker BYD has rejected allegations from the European Commission that its success is largely derived from state aid. European officials are investigating whether subsidies have helped the company undercut local rivals.

BYD Dolphin / Photo credit: Sime Darby Motors

Why it matters:
The end result of the investigation could be higher tariffs on Chinese EVs imported into Europe. The two sides coming to an amicable resolution would surely augur well for the EV industry, BYD, consumers, and the environment, preventing an acrimonious end.
5️⃣ East Ventures co-launches emissions calculator for Indonesian companies
The VC firm has partnered with Kadin Indonesia – the country’s chamber of commerce and industry – and research firm WRI Indonesia to launch Ecovisea. The platform is a free greenhouse gas calculator for businesses in the country.
Why it matters:
Doing the right thing can be costly and, for most companies, the bottom line comes before green affairs. If it’s cheaper for businesses to assess and then reduce their emissions, the hope is that more will be inclined to do so.

STARTUP WATCH
1️⃣ India’s Varaha raises $8.7m in series A round
RTP Global has led a series A funding round worth US$8.7 million in India-based Varaha. The startup produces carbon credits from afforestation and regenerative agricultural projects, among others.
2️⃣ This startup makes ground coffee from bread – no beans involved
Prefer, a Singapore-based firm, has bagged US$2 million in a seed round led by Forge Ventures. The company uses fermentation methods to make “bean-free coffee” as opposed to traditional coffee farming, which typically leads to deforestation and other negative environmental impacts.
3️⃣ South Korea’s InnoCSR secures new investment
By using clean brick-making tech, InnoCSR is working to change the traditional brick manufacturing industry and cut its environmental cost. The South Korean firm has raised an undisclosed amount of series A funding from ADB Ventures, along with support from Singapore-based Garden Impact Fund and Clarion Newlife Capital.
4️⃣ Pyxis bags $3.4m to help make the maritime industry greener
Pyxis has netted US$3.4 million in a seed funding round co-led by Motion Ventures and Shift4Good. The Singapore-based startup focuses on maritime electrification, aiming to replace fossil fuel-powered ships with vessels that run on electricity.

838959,2024-03-01T04:30:00,2024-03-01T03:56:17,TIA Conference’s next stop: Kuala Lumpur,tech-asia-conference-kuala-lumpur-heres,publish,post,https://www.techinasia.com/tech-asia-conference-kuala-lumpur-heres,"Tech in Asia is on a mission to serve the region’s tech and startup ecosystem. Over the years, we’ve rolled out thoughtful content, worked with great partners, and organized countless events to support our community and bring people together.
This year, we wanted to form even more meaningful connections and open up opportunities, so we’re bringing our flagship conference to a new place: Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

TIA Conference KL will be held from July 24 to 25 at the Hilton Hotel Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Tickets to this exciting event are now on sale.
(Note: Our annual conference in Jakarta, Indonesia, is still happening this year! Stay tuned for more details.)
Why KL?
You might be wondering, why KL?
Firstly, KL is a greenfield opportunity for Tech in Asia. There aren’t many tech conferences of a similar size or scale as ours in Malaysia, so we could really make a difference by providing a considerable avenue for learning and making connections. Plus, based on data from TIA Conference 2023, the third-largest share of attendees came from Malaysia (after Indonesia and Singapore), so it made sense to tap into this market.

Second, we can add value to Malaysia’s startup community by linking it to our unique networks. As a new player in the country’s tech events space, we offer something fresh by bringing together folks who would have otherwise never crossed paths.
When we were in KL in May 2023 for our Regional Founders Meetup, we saw an amazing turnout and got incredibly positive feedback. Plenty of participants remarked on how our event helped create new networking opportunities and how they were looking forward to more from us. We’re thrilled to be doing this on an even bigger scale.
Third, Malaysia is a market with a lot of potential, and we want to get involved with that. Its startups raised over US$86 million in 2023, according to Tech in Asia data. While this is a marked decrease from US$975 million in 2022, it’s the first time that funding has dipped since the Covid-19 pandemic began in 2020.
This indicates that there’s long-term and big-picture enthusiasm for Malaysia, albeit dampened by the ongoing tech winter.

Malaysia sits at an interesting position in Asia: Not only is it a priority market for many companies, but it is also a launchpad for firms that want to go regional or even global.
Additionally, the country’s population of 33 million is spread across highly diverse geographical terrain, making it a great place to test new ideas and products. Malaysia’s government is also championing tech and startups: For one, it aims to create 5,000 new startups by 2025. It also has a vision of turning KL into a startup and digital hub, having rolled out a host of initiatives and grants to support this.
Up and coming
With the country’s startup ecosystem looking poised for success, it only makes sense that the theme for TIA Conference KL is “Malaysia on the Rise.”
It’s also worth noting that Malaysia’s first unicorn emerged in 2021: used-vehicle marketplace Carsome. Meanwhile, other homegrown companies are putting themselves on the map. Aerodyne, for example, claimed the top spot in the global drone service provider rankings by Drone Industry Insights.
Malaysia’s startup scene is certainly rising to the occasion, and we’re excited to play a role in this growth via TIA Conference KL. Through curated networking sessions, exhibitions, panels, and other community activities, we’ll uncover the country’s potential and how the rest of Asia can best ride the wave of this up-and-coming tech ecosystem.
We’ve just begun selling tickets, and we’re running an early bird special where you can get them for up to 60% off! Prices start at US$40 (US$80 unit price) for a General Pass. This promotion is for a limited time only, so snap up your passes before it’s too late.

What kind of person creates a unicorn?
We’re not talking about the mythical creatures of legend, but startups with a valuation of US$1 billion or more.
We wanted to determine the demographics of the entrepreneurs who have guided their startups to unicorn status in Southeast Asia. For this, we analyzed the commonalities and differences in their path: Where did they study? Did they launch their company at home or abroad? What was their working life before they dove into the startup ecosystem?
To do so, we cross-referenced this list of Southeast Asia’s unicorns with publicly available biographical information on their founders from sources such as LinkedIn. The results include 79 founders or co-founders of the region’s 38 unicorns.
Before we dive in, here are some caveats on the data:

Publicly listed companies, decacorns (companies valued north of US$10 billion), and acquired firms have been excluded from the dataset.
Valuations of startups are based on data from Alternatives.pe and other publicly available sources as per the startups’ latest funding rounds.
Employment and education history on LinkedIn is self-reported, so by nature it may not be 100% accurate.

Global citizens
Unsurprisingly, in our increasingly connected world, Southeast Asia’s unicorn founders are global citizens. A total of 54% come from a Southeast Asian country, and 79% are within the broader Asia-Pacific region.

Of the founders on our list, 52% launched a unicorn that is headquartered somewhere other than their country of origin.
In terms of education, 51% studied overseas at one point.

From those who studied abroad, a large majority did so in the US.
Is there a substitute for experience?
The region’s unicorn founders are a highly educated bunch. Nearly 60% of them have a postgraduate qualification.

That said, few have worked for a large bank, tech company, or consulting firm prior to launching their startup, with just 38% having such prior work experience on their CV.
Reflecting the nascency of the Southeast Asian startup ecosystem, a hefty 70% were first-time founders. This also indicates that experience is no barrier to entry into the unicorn club.

Of the 38 unicorns, only 13 startups were led by one person, while the rest had two or more co-founders.
Ultimately though, the data reveals that the founders of some of the region’s brightest unicorns come from a wide variety of backgrounds and that there’s no one-size-fits-all approach to joining the billion-dollar club.

Imaginary Ones, a Web3 startup based in Singapore, was among those that capitalized on the non-fungible token hype, releasing a collection of 3D “bubble character” NFTs in 2022 that was sold out. But as the trend started to decline in 2023, the company said it is expanding its Web3 services into gaming, content, and merchandise.
To that end, Imaginary Ones has raised a fresh round of funding led by Dubai-based crypto investment firm Cypher Capital. Participants in the fundraise include Animoca Brands, ED3N Ventures, and MH Ventures.
While Imaginary Ones did not disclose the funding stage or amount, it said the round was oversubscribed.
“Our Web3 entertainment roadmap brings together gaming, merchandise, and content to create the Imaginary World,” said co-founder Clement Chia. “Imaginary World unites experiences in both the metaverse and in real life, where users play, interact, and build together.”
Most recently, Imaginary Ones launched a Web3 gaming series titled Bubble Rider and Bubble Rangers, which it claims has garnered 6 million plays in three weeks. The games were designed in collaboration with international fashion brand Hugo Boss.
Founded by Chia and David Lee in 2022, Imaginary Ones has transacted more than 17,000 Ethereum (around US$37 million) in sales volume on OpenSea. The Web3 company also plans to roll out its Bubble coin, which users can use to access its metaverse ecosystem.
Animoca Brands, for its part, has made multiple investments since the start of 2023. They include an NFT gaming firm that mixes Pokemon and Minecraft, a Hong Kong crypto firm, as well as a Japanese gaming company.

As social media companies like Meta and Snapchat reach giant status, real innovation often takes a backseat to watching what works on rival platforms and then building a similar product.
Thus, social apps that do something different – and find traction or virality while doing it – are often smaller players, such as Bondee or Clubhouse.
One startup aiming to replicate that success is Singapore-based Drigmo with its new app called Yolk.fm, which is looking to go viral for not using text. Instead, the app lets users post images, and then react with AI-generated stickers of their face (or other things).
The company has recently raised US$1.25 million in a pre-seed round led by Forge Ventures and joined by Sequoia’s Scout Fund, as well as partners and investors from DST Global and Temasek. A group of angel investors that include the founders and CEOs of companies like Carro, Carousell, Tableall, and Locofy.ai, also participated.
Co-founder Pieter-Paul Walraven, who calls himself the chief scrambler of Yolk, told Tech in Asia that the team had stumbled into the live sticker format. They noticed a glitch in Apple’s on-device segmentation and parsing tech, which was supposed to create photo cutouts but instead looped a one-second video back and forth.
“When someone in our co-working space approached us and asked what app we were using, we realized, why not make an app out of this bug?” he added.
Founders Walraven, Zihui Chen, and Meiwin Fu are ex-Googlers who are not new to the social app space. Previously, the trio launched an app also called Drigmo, where users can save restaurants they want to try next, share recommendations, and show off what they’ve been ordering.
Drigmo had a viral launch last year, but with Yolk, the team is going relatively lighter in features.
Apart from posting and reacting to snaps, users can add the reactions they receive to a “profile fidget spinner,” a roulette of animated stickers. Friends can also drop reactions to each other’s profile fidget spinner, which the company calls “spinner bombing.”
Initially, the team mulled adding support for text-based chats, thinking it would help retain users. But eventually, the idea was dropped.
“Adding the constraint of having to express yourself through live stickers only felt right with how we approached building Yolk – like it’s a toy,” Walraven said. “That’s when we decided to remove all text.”
Yolk is now available on the Apple App Store. Walraven said his team is using the new capital to test different marketing channels, boost R&amp;D efforts, and occasionally work with part-time remote talent.
Expanding on the last point, Walraven said that for now, Yolk is only a team of three, albeit with complementary skills. They are also running Drigmo concurrently, thus pursuing a multi-app strategy.
“We’ve just launched and are planning to grow Yolk day-by-day as we measure and adjust our activation strategies,” the exec said.

Amid layoffs and other cost-cutting measures, startup salaries across several Southeast Asian markets cooled down in 2023. Pay for junior engineering positions was most impacted, decreasing by 6%, according to a report by Glints and Monk’s Hill Ventures.
The research for “Southeast Asia Startup Talent Trends Report 2024” involved over 10,000 data points and 72 interviews with founders and operators in Singapore, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Taiwan. The startups surveyed are mainly early-stage companies, from post-seed to series B.
Demand for highly specialized senior talent, however, remained strong, with salaries growing 2% to 3% year on year, suggesting that “startups are increasingly relying on more experienced mid-to-senior roles to ensure their survival”. The region’s three highest paid tech roles are VP of engineering (whose median annual salary stood at US$193,200 in 2023), VP of product, and VP of data.

Revenue-generating roles also remained at the forefront, with business development and sales salaries seeing hikes of up to 20% last year.
In terms of hiring trends, the emergence of an AI-centric landscape has affected how startups recruit talent. For instance, there is a growing emphasis on soft skills, such as critical and creative thinking.
However, AI adoption is hampered by employees who are concerned that their jobs might be replaced by the tech, according to founders. That said, these fears have not necessarily become reality, as productivity gains from using AI lets companies maintain the same headcount without hiring new staff.
“When envisioning the future of work, it’s critical to seize AI opportunities while also adhering to fundamentals when it comes to hiring,” stated Oswald Yeo, co-founder and CEO of Glints.
Startups are also seeking regional talent to diversify their teams, with 70% of respondents intending to expand their cross-border hires. This ties in with a rise in hybrid work, which is among the initiatives startups offer to retain their staff.

Hello reader,
A running joke between my partner and I is that he should go and become a consultant. He’s got a master’s degree, has great research skills, and is really good at making things up as he goes along.
Also, consultants earn lots of money just for talking and making PowerPoint slides, right?
I kid. For all the jokes we make about consultants, the value they bring is often understated. The right insights and advice can catalyze a significant opportunity for a business that can bring in millions of dollars and cause transformative growth.
That’s why consultants cost a small fortune – you’re paying for a wealth of knowledge and expertise to help you get where you want to go, and that adds up quickly.
The startup we’re featuring in today’s premium story wants to change that. What if we could offer consulting – and other professional services – more efficiently and affordably?
That could change the game and make professional services more accessible to businesses of all shapes and sizes.
Today we look at:


Bld.ai’s mercenary approach to professional services 
The merger of Seek, Jobstreet, and JobsDB into a single platform
Other newsy highlights such as layoffs at PropertyGuru and Coupang’s latest financial results 


Premium summary
A mercenary approach

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Digital professional services firm Bld.ai operates on a few simple rules: Charge by the hour; be very careful about who you lend to; and only work as contractors, even at the CEO level.
This strategy led to the firm recording US$10.4 million in revenue and US$2.2 million in operating profit in 2022. Let’s take a closer look.


What it does: Bld.ai runs a network of independent partners who provide professional services in a number of fields such as engineering, product management, and accounting. These partners can range from individuals who work as freelancers or consultants to companies with over 100 staff.

All about efficiency: The company is able to keep overhead costs low by implementing infrastructure similar to Amazon. Part of these efforts is Flow, a back-office automation platform.

Up next: Bld.ai aims to grow its sales by 3x this year and reach over 1 million clients by 2029. According to CEO Danny Castonguay, the firm hopes to attract “some smart capital” to help it expand its networks.

Seek, an Australia-based operator of job marketplaces, has merged three of its platforms in Asia Pacific Seek, Jobstreet, and JobsDB.


But why: The move lets Seek reach more job hunters across Asia Pacific more effectively, said Peter Bithos, the company’s CEO for Asia. It aims to help 500 million people connect with the region’s 5 million companies.

And how: The company is looking to implement the AI-powered functionalities of the Seek platform into Jobstreet and JobsDBt. These include features that help employers assess applicants and give job seekers better recommendations. 

For context: The merger comes around a decade after Seek acquired Jobstreet for US$523.5 million and JobsDB for US$135 million. Seek said it has invested around US$118 million into the development of both platforms since their acquisitions.

838935,2024-02-29T08:04:12,2024-02-29T09:44:02,A Malaysian Web3 pioneer defies downturn with 33x profit surge since 2019,etherscans-26m-revenue-advertising-ceo,publish,post,https://www.techinasia.com/etherscans-26m-revenue-advertising-ceo,"In a world where major media corporations struggle to get advertising, a Web3 company based in Malaysia seems an odd choice for a success story.
But Block Solutions, the parent firm of Ethereum blockchain explorer and analytics platform Etherscan, is putting up numbers that would make most media companies scream with jealousy.
Its profit after tax has grown by over 33x in the last four financial years, as per the company’s filings for the financial year ended (FYE) June 2023.

Block Solutions was founded in 2015 and is headquartered in Shah Alam, located just west of Malaysia’s capital. The firm has raised US$500,000 in two seed rounds.
Ad revenue fuels growth
The company’s revenue has seen substantial gains, jumping by over 22x in its last five financial years. That said, the figure saw a minor 3% year-on-year decline in FYE 2023.
Its revenue growth is largely due to the success of its main product. Etherscan is one of the world’s most popular free Web3 utilities, with over 14 million users visiting the site monthly, according to SimilarWeb, a web analytics platform.
In the US, Etherscan ranks as the 56th most popular website for investing.
While web traffic doesn’t always equal profits, Block Solutions has turned those numbers into solid financials.
In FYE 2023, the company earned 123.3 million ringgit (US$25.8 million) in revenue from online advertising fees, which is the firm’s only source of revenue.

Its largest expense is operating expenses, which was about US$3 million in FYE 2023. However, a breakdown of its operating expenses wasn’t disclosed in its filings.
This is followed by server and website hosting fees, which amounted to around US$2 million during the same year.
That said, the company has paid more taxes than its operating expenses, as it incurred taxes of US$3.7 million in FYE 2023.
Block Solutions booked a net profit of US$18.6 million in its latest financial year, an increase of 4% compared to FYE 2022. This is a much smaller growth in its net profit from a few years before and could be due to the minor revenue decline it incurred during the year.
The company’s profit had more than doubled in FYE 2022 from a year earlier, and it experienced an over 13x year-on-year rise in FYE 2021. In FYE 2019, net profit was only about US$560,000.
The profit has seen the group’s cash and cash equivalents grow to US$51.4 million in FYE 2023.
Don’t change what isn’t broken
Matthew Tan, CEO and founder of Etherscan and owner of Block Solutions, doesn’t put any spin on the reasons for the firm’s success.
“If you drew a chart, the growth of Etherscan would likely mirror the growth of the blockchain ecosystem,” he tells Tech in Asia.
He does attribute the success in part to his team, which he says has a shared “culture of humility” and is always pushing forward to improve.

“We’ve been building since 2015 through thick and thin and will continue doing so,” he adds.
Tan also says the company has no immediate plans in 2024 to deviate from their current business model or look for additional ways to monetize the company’s tech.
“Our mission remains the same … which is to provide equitable human readable blockchain data access,” he explains.
This includes Solscan, the Solana blockchain explorer that Etherscan acquired in January this year.
According to a statement, Solscan was founded in 2021 and serves over three million monthly users. It has many of the same features as Etherscan, including detailed addresses, token and transaction information, APIs, dashboards, and NFT metadata.
Tan describes the merger as “synergistic.”
“We liked what they built and they have a strong team,” he says. “Our focus for Solscan in 2024 is to see how we can continue to make improvements to the explorer.”
He adds that he has not given a lot of thought to how the acquisition will affect Block Solutions’ bottom line, but it “should be manageable.”

Thailand-based bank SCBX is acquiring a 100% stake in the consumer finance firm Home Credit Vietnam through an 800 million euro (US$866 million) deal.
The acquisition, which will be carried out via SCBX unit Siam Commercial Bank, is expected to be completed in the first half of 2025, pending regulatory approvals in Vietnam and Thailand, according to a statement from the companies.
The move comes over a year after Home Credit divested its operations in Indonesia and the Philippines, for a total of around 615 million euros (US$666 million). Previously, Grab was reported to be in the running to acquire Home Credit’s assets in Southeast Asia and India.
Home Credit, founded in 1997 in the Czech Republic and owned by the international investment firm PPF Group, entered Vietnam in 2009.
It claimed to hold the second-largest market share in the country’s consumer finance, accounting for 14% of total market. The company has nearly 6,000 employees and 15 million customers in Vietnam.
“Home Credit Vietnam will serve as an important base for the SCBX Group’s presence in Vietnam and immediately contribute a positive bottom line to the group after deal completion,” said Arthid Nanthawithaya, CEO of SCBX.
Headquartered in the Netherlands, Home Credit is also present in China, as well as multiple countries in Europe and the US. The company has served 140 million customers in over 25 years and has more than 100 million registered app users globally.

Although the tech winter persisted, Southeast Asia’s tech sector still made 855 investment deals in 2023, according to a January Capital report. This is higher than the 760 deals in the year prior, and the second highest since 2018.
However, the region’s startups collectively only raised US$5.5 billion last year. It’s more than a 30% fall from US$8.4 billion in 2022, and is the lowest total capital raised since 2018.
The report, which was done in collaboration with January Capital’s affiliated platform Alternatives.pe, compiled data on over 20,000 companies from 2017 to 2023.
Much of the decline, though, had to do with later-stage deals. In 2023, both deal count and investment amount shrank for series B and C+. In contrast, early-stage (seed or series A) ventures remained robust, with an uptick in deal count and capital invested.
In terms of markets, Singapore and Indonesia were the primary beneficiaries. The city-state, in particular, witnessed the biggest increase in deal flow and capital investment in 2023.
The report also found that pre-money valuations remained largely stable at the seed stage. Series A, however, faced a downward re-rating, likely reflecting a trend of investors evaluating startups more rigorously.
Deal sizes at the seed stage hovered around US$1 million to US$2 million, with series A being consistent in Singapore and Indonesia but fluctuating in other ASEAN markets. Series B deals aligned with historical norms, settling in the US$10 million to US$20 million range.
However, there were significant year-on-year changes for series C+ deal sizes due to fewer data points.
Sector-wise, the SaaS, healthcare, and ecommerce sectors saw the most substantial increase in deal count, driven by investors channeling funds into proven business models. Fintech and ecommerce continued to dominate funding, while healthcare, F&amp;B, and AI sectors showed positive growth from 2021 through 2023.
Notably, ecommerce deal count reverted to pre-pandemic levels, with capital investment in the sector falling below US$750 million, primarily due to the absence of mega financing rounds. Fintech valuations decreased across all stages, mirroring global trends, with series A valuations being greatly affected.
Valuations declined across most sectors too, especially at the seed and series A stages, with the most significant drops found in ecommerce and fintech. In contrast, SaaS and F&amp;B valuations remained resilient.

Nium, a fintech firm backed by GIC and Temasek, has secured a payments license from Japan’s financial regulator to handle large-amount transactions in the country.
The Type 1 Funds Transfer Service Provider license, issued by the Japanese Financial Services Agency, authorizes Nium to provide a wide range of financial services. This includes offering fund transfers of up to 50 million yen (US$334,000) per transaction via Zengin-Net, Japan’s payment clearing network, to a Japanese beneficiary account.
Nium said that it is the first global company to have met the Type 1 license standards, “with the JFSA recognizing its ability to integrate with local payment rails, deliver real-time transactions, provide transparent costs, and offer significantly cheaper rates.”
Anupam Pahuja, Nium’s executive vice president of Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa, noted that the company has become an alternative to banks for large fund transfers into and out of Japan.
In its FY 2022 financials released last August, Nium’s revenue surged over 266% year on year, while its losses rose 28.1% to S$68.8 million (US$51 million). It has also been actively expanding into Malaysia and Japan.
Nium co-founder and CEO Prajit Nanu said last July that the company aims to break even in time for a US IPO by end-2024. It was then valued at US$2 billion.

As demand for ecommerce rises in India’s lower-tier cities, third-party logistics companies are poised to capitalize on it. One such player is last-mile logistics startup Shadowfax, which provides delivery solutions focused on online-first brands.
The company has raised US$100 million in a series E round led by TPG NewQuest. Indian ecommerce giant Flipkart participated in the round, having first injected funds into Shadowfax in the latter’s US$60 million series D round in late 2019.
Other participating investors include Mirae Asset Venture Investments (India), the World Bank-backed International Finance Corporation, and NGP Capital (formerly Nokia Growth Partners).
Shadowfax also said in its statement that it is on track to achieve its first full financial year of positive EBITDA in 2024.
Founded in 2015 by a team of IIT Delhi alumni, Shadowfax offers traditional ecommerce logistics services as well as hyperlocal 30-minute deliveries. The company said it has a network of 125,000 delivery partners and 3.5 million users.
According to Tech in Asia’s database, Shadowfax has secured over US$250 million in total disclosed funding. It plans to use the new investment to expand its middle-mile network and last-mile delivery services, with a goal of covering all 20,000 postal codes across India.

KeaBabies, a Singapore-based baby products company, hit revenue of US$58 million in 2023, its co-founder and CEO Ivan Ong said. According to Ong’s LinkedIn post, the amount is an increase from US$37 million of revenue in 2022.
This continues a trend of digitally native consumer brands from Singapore that have gained traction in the US. Its peers include gaming chair maker Secretlab and furniture retailer Castlery.
Without disclosing specifics, Ong told Tech in Asia that KeaBabies continued to be profitable 2023 with double-digit net profit margins. The firm, which is bootstrapped, first turned a profit in its sixth month of operations. In 2020, it had US$20 million in sales.
Founded by Ong and his wife Jane Neo in 2017 with a US$30,000 investment, KeaBabies specializes in safe and functional products for parents and babies, including maternity care items and baby essentials.
While headquartered in Singapore, the company manufactures its products in China and sells them to the US market, with help from Amazon’s fulfillment services.
Ong said in his post that KeaBabies initially had a US$50 million target for its 2023 revenue. Among other things, the bigger-than-expected growth is due to a “clear path for product expansion and sales growth,” he told Tech in Asia.
KeaBabies has 67 employees, according to Ong. As the company is cash flow positive, it has “no plans for a fundraise and will continue to grow organically for now,” he added.

Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), the country’s sovereign wealth fund and the world’s tenth-largest, has launched a US$1 billion venture capital fund of funds program. QIA will invest the money in international and regional VC funds.
The program aims to attract international VC funds and entrepreneurs to both Qatar and the wider Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region, which also includes Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. In turn, QIA hopes to grow a local and regional base of VCs and entrepreneurs.
In a statement, QIA CEO Mansoor Ebrahim Al-Mahmoud said that “there is currently no dedicated pool of capital in Qatar for companies that are past seed funding and are ready for series A to series C funding rounds.”
The sovereign wealth fund said it will focus on the fintech, edtech, and healthcare sectors. The program will primarily only invest in VC funds, but it is open to co-investing directly into companies.
To demonstrate their commitment, fund managers looking to raise money from QIA may be required to establish an operational footprint in Qatar, set up a senior-level presence in the country, or expand across the GCC.
After missing the initial boom, Middle Eastern funds have ramped up their investments in Southeast Asia over the past two years. According to Refinitiv data, Gulf-based funds participated in 59 deals in Southeast Asia from 2022 to 2023, up from just seven deals in 2018 to 2019.
QIA in particular has co-led a US$150 million funding round in One Championship. It has also backed Malaysian used-car unicorn Carsome.

Hello reader,
Not to sound like an old-timer, but I remember life in Hanoi before ride-hailing apps really took off.
When I first moved here in 2015, getting a motorbike taxi from one place to another usually involved a bit of negotiation over the price with a man sitting on a street corner with his bike. I normally came off second-best in those tête-à-têtes, owing to my limited Vietnamese language skills.
Nowadays though, myself and millions of other Hanoians use apps like Grab daily, mercifully saving me from losing my VND at the hands of motorbike taxi drivers.
While Grab has long been helping my wallet, it’s taken a bit longer for the company itself to turn a profit, but it managed to do so last year. The charts in today’s featured premium story outline the company’s stellar Q4 performance and other key metrics.
Today we look at:

A financial health check on Grab
A Singapore-based B2B payments firm’s new fundraise.
Other newsy highlights such as Shein reportedly considering moving its IPO to London and a former Funding Societies exec launching an AI startup.

Charting Grab’s road to profit

Image credit: Timmy Loen

The fourth quarter of last year brought good tidings for Southeast Asian super app Grab, with a net profit of US$11 million.
The firm has its fingers in plenty of pies across ride-hailing, food delivery, and financial services, so getting your mind wrapped around a business of that scale can be tricky. Luckily, our charts have you covered.


On the come-up: Grab has been steadily chipping away at its losses over the last year. In Q4 2022,the company recorded a loss of US$391 million, with the turnaround to profit a year later making for a 102.8% increase. The firm lost a hefty US$1.1 billion in the final quarter of 2021.

Usage rates: For the last three quarters, Grab reported quarter-on-quarter increases in its total number of monthly active users. The figure hit 37.7 million in Q4 of last year, up from 36 million in Q3.

Incentivization: The company did slightly increase its spending on incentives for consumers and partners in Q4 2023, seemingly in a bid to boost demand. Consumer incentives are typically discounts for the company’s services, while partner incentives refer to payments made to merchants and drivers on its platform. In total, Grab spent US$397 million on incentives in Q4, up from US$381 million the quarter prior.

Funding flows for Fluid

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Fluid, a Singapore-based B2B payments firm, has raised US$5.2 million in a series A round led by Insignia Ventures Partners.
The company has now raised a total of US$7 million after it first secured US$1.8 million in seed funding from Iterative and New Stack Ventures.


B2B boost: Fluid offers a platform that aims to solve businesses’ issues with deferred payments, which are typically complex and can involve risky credit terms. It helps companies get paid faster and offer flexible payment options to their own clients.

Experience: The startup was founded early last year by CEO Trasy Lou Walsh, CPO Steven Li, and CFO Ruoyun Yang. Between the three founders, they bring to the table experience from Atome, Uber, Coupang Pay, Lendable, and the International Finance Corporation.

Smooth: By using Fluid’s services, suppliers can avoid engaging with debt providers, undergoing credit checks for buyers, or hiring large teams for settlement and reconciliation, according to Walsh.

Photo credit: GoTo Group

GoTo Group chief Patrick Walujo said that Tokopedia‘s market share has been diminishing – especially among price-conscious consumers – as the group cut down on incentives to achieve profitability. That, along with the “very intense” competition in the Indonesian ecommerce space, led to the TikTok acquisition, which was completed last month.
“Our competitors are large foreign companies with significant funding,” said Walujo in today’s public expose event. “To grow and survive, Tokopedia requires a very large investment.”
According to data revealed at the event, Tokopedia has 18 million monthly active users (MAUs). That’s a far cry from the 100 million it previously said it had, though the calculation methods may be different.
Meanwhile, TikTok Shop has 125 million MAUs in Indonesia. That said, its estimated Indonesia gross merchandise value (GMV) for 2023, at US$6 billion, is still lower than Tokopedia’s US$15.6 billion.
The company also disclosed that prior to the acquisition, independent assessors valued Tokopedia at US$606 million. TikTok acquired 75% of Tokopedia for US$1.8 billion, in a mix of a US$1 billion promissory note and newly issued shares.
While the move lets TikTok Shop resume operations in Indonesia, GoTo Group will also receive an ongoing revenue stream – in the form of an ecommerce service fee – from Tokopedia. In the public expose document, GoTo said that it will take an agreed-upon percentage from the combined entity’s GMV.
For now, the two platforms are focused on the integration process, which Walujo expects to be completed no later than April. To comply with government regulations, TikTok Shop’s system will handle promotional parts of the business, while the actual shopping and payment transactions will be done on Tokopedia’s back-end.
Teten Masduki, Indonesia’s minister of cooperatives and SMEs, recently commented that TikTok Shop still violated regulations. However, the Ministry of Trade – which has jurisdiction for issuing ecommerce regulations in the country – will audit the integration process after four months to decide whether there are still any violations.
GoTo reported a positive adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2023, with further details to be revealed in its next earnings call in March.

GudangAda founder and CEO Stevensang / Photo credit: GudangAda

Indonesian B2B ecommerce company GudangAda has “categorically denied” that it has any plans for winding down operations in the short term. According to a statement, the company “remains operational” and is diversifying into new categories, such as beauty and personal care, that have shown promise.
The statement comes after DealStreetAsia reported that GudangAda’s board is mulling options that include winding down operations. The board is also reportedly considering returning capital to investors as it deliberates on the business’ future, though it has not made a decision, the report said.
On the latter point, the GudangAda statement said that discussions around business refocus or strategies are “routine processes.” Any decisions on capital allocation will be communicated “with full transparency and in due course,” the company said.
The firm also touted the “significant growth” of its new categories, which it said made up as much as 37% of overall revenue in February 2024.
B2B ecommerce startups have struggled of late. In India, Udaan sacked at least 100 employees in December 2023.
Indonesia-based Ula, meanwhile, also cut jobs and exited its FMCG distribution model in October. It’s still unclear what business the company will pivot to.
GudangAda, for its part, saw revenue soar 10x to US$50 million in the 2022 financial year, its most recent publicly available financials. However, the company failed to reach its past goal of breaking even by that year, with losses widening to US$33 million.
The company last raised US$100 million in July 2021 for its series B round, which brought its total funds raised to US$135 million.

838799,2024-02-28T07:33:46,2024-02-28T07:33:46,Why Grab’s shares declined despite its ‘strong’ Q4 results,grabs-shares-declined-strong-q4-results,publish,post,https://www.techinasia.com/grabs-shares-declined-strong-q4-results,"Last week, Grab reported what it termed a “strong set” of results for the fourth quarter of 2023, even announcing a surprise share repurchase program.
However, the super-app’s shares fell by over 8% in the trading session following the announcement. They have remained down by 9% since then.
The share price drop may seem unwarranted for a company that just logged full-year unaudited revenue of US$2.4 billion, above the higher end of its guidance. While Grab ended 2023 in the red, the US$485 million loss for the year was a 72% improvement from 2022’s figure.

Photo credit: Hafiz Johari / Shutterstock

Its other financial metrics looked good too. Adjusted EBITDA for the group in Q4 2023 was US$35 million, following the landmark US$29 million it reported on the same metric for the previous quarter – Grab’s first-ever quarter of profitability on that metric.
It wasn’t just adjusted earnings that were in the black. In the three months ended December 2023, Grab saw both positive net income and adjusted free cash flow of US$11 million and US$1 million, respectively. Free cash flow is the money a business has left after deducting operating expenses and capital expenditures, and can be considered a key measure of profitability.
So what explains the discordant market reaction?
Revenue guidance below expectations
There were a few caveats.
As Grab’s CFO Peter Oey pointed out during the earnings call, the positive net income figure was flattered by the reversal of an accounting accrual that was “no longer required.”
While the company did not disclose the amount of this reversal, net income would have been lower – possibly even negative – in its absence.
Oey also cautioned that going forward, its quarterly adjusted free cash flow levels could fluctuate “due to seasonal factors and the timing of payments for certain expenses.”

Peter Oey / Photo credit: Linkedin profile

In other words, net income and adjusted free cash flow may not be consistently positive in the quarters to come.
It’s important to remember that markets are remorselessly forward-looking. Unless there are unexpected surprises in earnings results, much of what companies report are already priced in.
For example, continued improvement in Grab’s adjusted earnings was not a surprise, given the consistent quarter-on-quarter progress shown in the past two years.

What may have disappointed investors was the company’s 2024 revenue guidance of US$2.7 billion to US$2.75 billion, which fell below analysts’ expectations of US$2.8 billion, according to data from London Stock Exchange Group.
However, even taking the low end of the guidance, this is under 4% off from what analysts were expecting.
Assessing Grab’s growth plans
Grab appeared prepared to address the issue of future growth, dedicating a slide in its presentation deck to set out how it planned to increase gross merchandise value (GMV) in the mid-term.
These include initiatives to attract new users, improve existing ones’ retention and frequency of app usage, and increase average order values.

An example of how Grab intends to gain new users is through a new product called Family Accounts. According to CEO Anthony Tan, family members can create and join a group account, where they can share payment methods and keep track of each other’s rides.
For now, the feature appears to be available only to users of Grab’s mobility service, as it is being pitched as a way for users to have peace of mind when their family members are commuting.
The company did face some pushback on its optimistic growth projections, too. As Jiong Shao of Barclays noted during the earnings call, the law of large numbers dictates that a company’s “growth rate tends to decelerate, moderate” as it gets bigger.”
In response, Tan said he was “very confident” of the team’s ability to drive growth and added that the firm plans to double down on advertising, where penetration in Southeast Asia is “still very low”.
He also highlighted Grab’s fintech business, where the company expects deposits and loans to continue growing strongly at its digital banks.

Grab’s plan to improve retention and user engagement through GrabUnlimited also raises questions. While the subscription program accounts for one-third of deliveries GMV in the most recent quarter, this is relatively unchanged from the levels in Q2 and Q3 2023.
Speaking on its Q2 earnings last August, Grab COO Alex Hungate said GrabUnlimited’s penetration level was then “quite high”, and that it was “hard to see [GrabUnlimited] representing the majority of [the company’s] customers.”
This natural ceiling could explain why Hungate spoke of using GrabUnlimited to improve customer lifetime value by “driving up cross-sell rates” in its mobility and financial services businesses in last week’s call. Currently, promotions available to GrabUnlimited customers are mostly applicable to food and grocery deliveries.
While Grab has a plan to grow GMV – and consequently, revenue – as well as a track record of achieving its targets, the uncertainty of recently floated plans could have led investors to discount the potential of realizing such revenue gains in the future.
Trust us, we’re management
A big positive surprise was Grab’s announcement of its first-ever share repurchase program of up to US$500 million.
How does this program generate shareholder value?
As legendary investor Warren Buffet said to shareholders of his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway in the latter’s 2022 annual report, “When the share count goes down, your interest in our many businesses goes up. Every small bit helps if repurchases are made at value-accretive prices.”
Indeed, many other US-listed tech companies, from Uber to Meta and Airbnb, have recently announced buybacks as a way to return excess cash to shareholders.
However, the Oracle of Omaha also warned that “when a company overpays for repurchases, the continuing shareholders lose. At such times, gains flow only to the selling shareholders.”

Warren Buffett / Photo credit: freeimage4life

Grab’s board has given management a broad mandate, with the company being able to make repurchases “from time to time through open market transactions at prevailing market prices [or through] privately negotiated transactions.”
As Oey shared, Grab’s management will have “full flexibility” in how it goes about with the buying back of shares.
He pledged that the company would be “efficient” in how it uses that cash for those buybacks in order to achieve “the highest rate of return for our shareholders.”
While news of this program is certainly welcome, it should be noted that in 2022 and 2023, Grab spent a total of US$716 million on share-based compensation – i.e., paying its employees with shares in the company.
The newly announced buyback will reduce the company’s share count, but shareholders will continue to see dilution in their holdings from such employee share payment schemes.
Home market bias
Earlier this month, Uber announced its first share repurchase program worth US$7 billion. This was valued at around 5% of Uber’s market cap before the program was announced. The equivalent figure for Grab, meanwhile, was around 4%.
On another metric – revenue growth – Grab is also keeping up with its US-listed peers like Uber and DoorDash, even having the highest expected revenue growth rate between 2023 and 2025.

Yet, Grab’s shares have significantly underperformed DoorDash and Uber over the past year.

US investors who are unfamiliar with Southeast Asia may still be holding on to reservations about buying into Grab’s growth story. Why chase the stocks of companies operating in less stable markets on the other side of the world when you can invest in domestically listed equivalents?
That’s the conundrum faced by Southeast Asia’s tech champions like Grab and Sea Group, which are trading on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange, respectively. Both are listed in the US, a market with the deepest pool of capital, but also one where investors are more familiar with the business models of tech companies, compared to investors elsewhere.
Yet, many of these investors may simply not see the need to diversify their portfolios when they already have good alternatives they are more familiar with.",Grab’s shares have underperformed US-listed peers like Uber and DoorDash over the past year despite having similar growth prospects.,Simon Huang,Editing by Melissa Goh and Dhania Putri Sarahtika,open,2,,https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/1682995649_shutterstock_2095751974-scaled.jpg,false,"",false,true,true,true,false,6,,1343,Why Grab’s shares declined despite its ‘strong’ Q4 results,Grab’s shares have underperformed US-listed peers like Uber and DoorDash over the past year despite having similar growth prospects.,,,"","",""

Online lenders facing increased scrutiny in Indonesia amid concerns over their debt collection practices
Sea Group’s plan to acquire a minority stake in Bank Negara Indonesia-owned Hibank
Wealth management platforms struggling to turn a profit despite seeing a bump in their assets under management


Hi there,
As a journalist, it’s usually hard for me to interview those in deep financial trouble. However, this week’s Big Story features a source who volunteered to speak about his firsthand experience with online debt.
His struggles, compounded by his lender’s aggressive debt collection tactics, are profound.
In Indonesia, these tactics have even driven some borrowers to self-harm.
For online lenders in the country, such aggression stems from the pressure to recover owed funds and is exacerbated by rising default rates.
As default rates climb, Indonesian regulators are increasing their scrutiny of the industry by imposing stricter capital and compliance requirements. They’re also lowering interest rates and instructing banks to cease channeling loans to online lending platforms.
While lowering interest rates could ultimately reduce default rates and ease pressure on borrowers to repay their loans, there’s a potential downside: It could limit the pool of borrowers that online lenders can serve.
Meanwhile, in this week’s Hot Take, I delve into the potential acquisition by Sea Group of a Bank Negara Indonesia-owned digital bank. How might this move advance Sea Group’s position in the digital banking market?

THE HOT TAKE
How will a Hibank acquisition benefit Sea Group?

Photo credit: ximagination / 123RF

Here’s what happened:

Sea Group will reportedly be acquiring Indonesia-based digital bank Hibank as soon as Q2 2024.
State-owned Bank Negara Indonesia (BNI), which owns a controlling stake in Hibank, will retain its majority stake after the transaction, according to BNI president director Royke Tumilaar.
Currently, BNI holds 63.92% of Hibank, while the rest remains with multinational F&amp;B firm Mayora Group.

Here’s our take:
A potential acquisition of Hibank comes as no surprise considering BNI and Sea Group’s past relationships.
For one, BNI joined hands with Sea Group in 2022 to transform domestic lender Bank Mayora into a digital bank.
Sea Group was involved in both the business model and IT design for Bank Mayora, which rebranded to Hibank in 2023.
Tumilaar said at the time that BNI was open to the possibility of selling part of its shares in Bank Mayora to Sea Group and diluting its stake “to some 50%.”
Under BNI’s ownership, Hibank has performed well. During the first half of 2023, it recorded a net profit of 127.7 billion rupiah (US$8.2 million), marking a 312% year-on-year growth. This surge was propelled by a 76.5% year-on-year increase in net interest income.
Its total credit disbursed reached 4.7 trillion rupiah (US$302.8 million) during the same period.
Nevertheless, the size of its lending book still lags behind some local banks in Indonesia. Bukalapak-backed Allo Bank, which reported a profit of 216.3 billion rupiah (US$13.8 million), had a total credit of 7.4 trillion rupiah (US$472.8 million) in the first half of 2023.
Meanwhile, Sea Group itself has ventured into the digital banking sector by acquiring Bank Kesejahteraan Ekonomi in 2021, which it rebranded to SeaBank Indonesia.
However, though SeaBank Indonesia’s performance has improved significantly since then, it still remains considerably smaller compared to Hibank in net profit. The digibank made 34.8 billion rupiah (US$2.2 million) in the first half of 2023, which represents only 26.8% of Hibank’s figure. SeaBank Indonesia’s total credit, on the other hand, was over 3x larger than Hibank’s at 14.5 trillion rupiah (US$926.3 million).
Acquiring a stake in the Indonesia-based digital bank would therefore give Sea Group a stronger foothold in the country’s banking segment.
This move carries significant implications, particularly considering BNI’s stature as a major bank, with 10.4 trillion rupiah (US$664.5 million) in net profit and 650.8 trillion rupiah (US$41.6 billion) in total disbursed credit in H1 2023.
An acquisition would further bolster Sea Group’s competitive position in a market where many still rely heavily on banking services offered by traditional banks due to a lack of financial literacy. As one of the largest players in Indonesia’s banking sector, BNI wields considerable influence.
Meanwhile, Mayora Group’s products – sold by retailers across the country – are consumed by millions of Indonesians daily.
By acquiring a share of Hibank, Sea Group will gain access to Mayora Group’s established network and expertise in the food and beverage industry, as well as its customer base. These could, in turn, become potential customers of the bank down the line.

838620,2024-02-28T06:00:24,2024-02-27T07:49:00,How companies can build consumer trust in an age of privacy concerns,companies-build-consumer-trust-age-privacy-concerns,publish,post,https://www.techinasia.com/companies-build-consumer-trust-age-privacy-concerns,"Do you know to what extent companies are tracking you and your data?
If your answer is “no,” you’re not alone.
“The average consumer doesn’t really understand how much is really being tracked and how little control they have over it,” says Glenn Gore, CEO of Affinidi, a technology firm offering data and identity management solutions.

As a result, many consumers are more cautious about divulging personal data to companies in the first place and strive to have greater awareness about their data and privacy rights.
“Consumers choose the sites they interact with based on their privacy and trust policies – if it doesn’t seem trustworthy, they’re not going to transact on it,” Gore shares.
This lack of trust could negatively affect businesses’ brand image, customer relationships, and ultimately, their bottom lines.
However, customers are also demanding more personalized experiences at the same time – something that can only be possible with data.
This begs the question: What can businesses do to build trust in order to collect the data they need to give customers these personalized experiences?
Fostering trust
According to Gore, one of the first things companies can do is to clearly communicate what they need customer data for.
When getting people to fill in sign-up forms, for example, companies should explain clearly why they need someone’s information and how sharing a specific piece of information may be beneficial. This creates a sense that the company has the user’s best interest in mind.
While this may be obvious for some fields, such as name and email address, it may be less so for others. A pet shop, for example, may want to know when a customer’s birthday is in order to offer birthday month promotions, even though it isn’t directly relevant to the pet shop’s core services.

“Also, use natural language,” Gore adds. “Move away from legal jargon – it’s hard for people to understand.”
This approach is even more important when you consider that a recent International Data Corporation (IDC) Infobrief, produced in partnership with Affinidi, found that over 87% of customers stopped signing up for apps due to excessive hassles or perceived lack of trustworthiness. The less friction for the end user, the better.
On a related note, Gore also recommends that companies streamline the kinds of information they collect from customers.
“Limit the amount of information you actually need and store,” he says. “Aside from reducing friction on the customer’s end, from a security perspective, the least amount of data that the business collects about people means that if there’s a security breach, then the minimum amount of data will be leaked.”
It also helps build customer trust when businesses avoid holding on to customer data if it isn’t necessary.
Consider a bank: It only needs to know someone’s financial position and employment history at the point of approving them for a loan – once that’s been disbursed, it doesn’t need that information anymore and could discard it.
A new way of doing familiar things
Aside from reworking the way they interact with customers and their data, businesses should also tackle the question of personal data and privacy with a different mindset – that of holistic identity management.
Instead of companies holding all the data, holistic identity management offers the opportunity to “flip the script” and put the power back in the hands of consumers. Customers can pick and choose what to share with businesses, which helps build greater trust.

“The average person has almost 200 online identities and accounts and no way to link those together,” Gore explains. “With holistic identity management, you can unify these identities. Instead of having to log in to a business, a business has to ‘log in’ to you.”
While holistic identity management is a relatively new concept, Affinidi aims to make it more widespread by educating the market and developers as well as through its Affinidi Trust Network Suite of products.
The network offers products to help developers integrate data from multiple sources. It ensures that the data shared is accurate and not falsified and gives individuals the means to provide consent for data sharing while verifying the identities of all parties involved.

It also includes services such as the Affinidi Vault, which allows users to discover, store, collect, share, and even monetize their data. There’s also Affinidi Login, a passwordless authentication product, and Affinidi Concierge, a private AI personal assistant that helps users optimize and manage the use of their stored data.
Here’s what it would look like in action: Instead of having to create a new account when shopping on a new ecommerce platform, users can just “log in” with their Affinidi Vault and share relevant information with the site. And the data they can share isn’t just the usual particulars like their name, gender, mailing address, and credit card information. They can also disclose more specific things that can lead to a better experience on the site, such as the style of clothes they prefer.
Instead of having to log in to a business, a business has to ‘log in’ to you.
Data certainly backs the notion of holistic identity. The IDC infobrief found that 87% of customers are willing to share personal information in return for rewards, discounts, offers, and improved experiences. What if you could show your health insurance provider that you exercise regularly by sharing workout data from your Fitbit app and pay a lower premium?
“If you can control your data – and control how you share these aspects about yourself – you as a consumer can unlock different brand values,” says Gore. “There’s a lot of ourselves that we can’t access today, but holistic identity unlocks that and lets you reclaim your identity.”
The winds of change
Greater privacy and greater personalization may seem to be at odds, but they can go hand in hand. Rethinking their approach to data collection and leveraging new methods of authentication and identity management can help businesses create this flywheel of trust with customers.
This will be all the more important with the rise of AI.
“It’s never been cheaper or easier to store data, and AI is incredibly good at going through vast amounts of data and identifying patterns of aspects that actual humans wouldn’t even be able to see,” Gore explains. “If you take that combination of data that never dies and the AI that can see everything, that’s when you can see that it’s quite easy to misuse AI for bad purposes. So it’s critical that consumers and companies have greater control and awareness of their data.”
And one bonus? Holistic identity management also enables better customer relationships and experiences.
“Companies that can establish the highest trust with their consumers will be the winners,” Gore shares. “If I trust the company more, I’m willing to share even more about myself, and if I share more about myself, I’m going to get an even better experience.”

Under a potential deal announced at a court hearing in Singapore on Monday, Chua would buy out Cake Group co-founder and CEO Julian Hosp’s interest in the company. The judge overseeing the winding-up application adjourned the case for five weeks so that Chua could review the offer.
When contacted by Tech in Asia, Chua said he is considering the deal.

The terms of the deal were not disclosed. If Chua accepts the deal, it would likely end months of in-fighting between him and Hosp, which was sparked by a round of layoffs at Cake Group in November 2023.
At the time, Chua said that he was opposed to the layoffs, adding that Hosp had kept him out of the loop and unilaterally carried out the job cuts.
Chua, who is still a director at the company, filed the winding-up application last December. He stepped down from his role as CTO in January this year.
Hosp tweeted that his lawyers had filed a notice with the courts stating he would resist the winding-up application.

In an email sent to employees last November, Hosp acknowledged that Cake Group grew operating costs too quickly and underestimated “both the longevity and extent of a broader slowdown in the crypto landscape.”
The group, which earns from transaction fees, rose to prominence in 2021 – its best year financially – and was considered one of the biggest crypto firms in Singapore. That year, the company’s revenue reached US$631 million and its operating income stood at US$203 million, according to its financial statements.
But Cake Group suffered with the rest of the crypto market in 2022 after the collapse of Terra Labs. Revenue for the year dwindled by over half to US$266 million while profit fell to US$23.5 million.
Hosp could not be reached for comment. He posted on X (formerly Twitter) acknowledging the adjournment but did not mention the offer to sell.

The two founders established Cake Group in 2019 along with John Rost and Howard Fineman. The latter two left the company in 2021.
Rost and Fineman sued Cake Group over their exit packages in 2023, a case which was settled on February this year, according to an X post from Bake, a crypto platform under the Cake Group umbrella. Bake changed its name from Cake DeFi in June 2023.

Photo credit: Daraz

Daraz Group, a Pakistan-based ecommerce platform owned by Alibaba, has decided to significantly reduce its staff size in all markets, Reuters reported, citing an internal memo from acting CEO James Dong.
The memo did not reveal the exact number of affected employees, but sources told Profit, a local Pakistani publication, that it could be around a quarter of the company’s global workforce. This could be around 250 to 400 people in Pakistan, Daraz’s biggest market, and up to 800 workers across the whole Daraz Group.
Besides Pakistan, Daraz is present in Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. It has also operated in Myanmar, though the market – which is in the middle of a prolonged civil war – is no longer listed on the Daraz website.
In the memo, Dong – who is concurrently serving as Lazada’s group CEO – said that Daraz’s “cost structure continues to fall short of our financial targets.” The company had to act quickly to secure its long-term sustainability and growth, he added.
The move comes roughly a month after the exit of Bjarke Mikkelsen, Daraz’s founder and long-serving CEO. At the time, Mikkelsen said that Dong would work on better integrating Daraz with its sister platforms via Alibaba. These include Lazada, Trendyol, and AliExpress.
Launched by Rocket Internet, Daraz started in 2012 in Pakistan as an online fashion retailer. It was acquired by Alibaba in 2018.
Around this time last year, the company had slashed 11% of its workforce amid difficult market conditions. The move affected around 300 workers.

1. Strong revenue growth
Net revenue of US$6.6 billion for Q4 2023 was a 23% year-on-year increase.
For 2023 as a whole, net revenue stood at US$24.4 billion, up 18% from the previous year.
2. Improving profitability
Gross profit for the quarter grew 32% year on year to US$1.7 billion with a gross profit margin of 25.6%, showing an improvement of 160 basis points. Additionally, adjusted EBITDA stood at US$294 million with a margin of 4.5%, a 50 basis point improvement compared to the previous year.
Coupang’s product commerce segment showed strong growth and improved profitability, recording adjusted EBITDA of US$444 million for Q4. However, its developing offerings segment reported a negative adjusted EBITDA of US$150 million, swelling from negative US$55 million in the same period a year ago.
This latter segment includes the company’s international offerings and fintech businesses as well as Coupang Eats and Coupang Play.
3. Growing customer base
Active customers stood at over 21 million in Q4, 16% more compared to a year ago. This indicates that the company is successfully attracting and retaining customers – crucial for long-term growth and sustainability.
There is more opportunity for the company to grow as well, with Coupang representing just a single-digit share of total retail spend in Korea and an even smaller share in Taiwan.
Following the announcement of these results, Coupang’s shares rose by over 12% in after-hours trading.

He had been borrowing money from several online lending platforms, and his growing expenses as well as high repayments – including interest rates of around 12% a month – drove him to a point where he could no longer afford to pay them.
Ricky says his predicament was made worse by a debt collector, who used harsh language and threats to compel him into paying up. The collector even pressed one of Ricky’s friends in an attempt to get money.
“I felt humiliated. I considered ending my life. But I had my brother-in-law, who helped me get out of that place,” he recalls.
However, many Indonesians facing similar pressures as Ricky are not as fortunate. From 2019 to 2023, there were 51 suicide and attempted suicide cases reportedly linked to online lending and door-to-door or doorstep loans, according to monitoring by the Center for Financial and Digital Literacy (CFDL).
The data, which was based on news reports, should have spurred the authorities and businesses to act promptly, stressed CFDL founder Rahman Mangussara. He established CFDL with Muhamad Ihsan, CEO of Indonesian business publication Warta Ekonomi.
In recent months, internet users have also expressed their concerns about how online lenders collect debt, further tarnishing the industry’s reputation.
High default rates
Debt collection, however, is just one of the complexities facing Indonesia’s online lending sector.
In January, Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (OJK), the country’s financial services authority, lowered the maximum interest rates that online lending platforms can charge.

The OJK headquarters in Jakarta / Photo credit: Porto News

Such companies can only charge a maximum of 0.1% and 0.3% interest per day for productive and consumptive loans, respectively, which will gradually be slashed to 0.067% and 0.1% by 2026. This is a decrease from 0.4% for both categories previously.
While this takes some pressure off of the borrowers, it also limits what lenders and platforms can earn.
OJK also instructed banks last week to stop lending to peer-to-peer startups that have seen defaults in repayments.
This could be a big challenge for these startups. According to OJK data, as of December 2023, banks had lent 30.4 trillion rupiah (US$1.9 billion) via P2P lending platforms, representing 62% of the 49.3 trillion rupiah (US$3.2 billion) of total domestic P2P loans.
The OJK order comes amid high default rates that alarmed individual lenders.
In June 2023, OJK reported that online lending companies in the country had US$113 million in overdue loans lasting up to 90 days, up 55% from the previous year.
See also: IGrow’s sprouting credit issues disquiet P2P investors
Joel Shen, who heads Withersworldwide’s Indonesia and Asia tech practice, says OJK’s recent move will further reduce the liquidity available to P2P lenders.
Furthermore, the regulator has increased the minimum equity requirement from 1 billion rupiah (US$63,900) to 2.5 billion rupiah (US$159,800) in 2023. This figure will gradually rise to reach 12.5 billion rupiah (US$799,100), while the paid-up capital will be increased to 25 billion rupiah (US$1.6 million).
“This combination of factors has adversely affected P2P lenders, and the most recent move by OJK to curb institutional lending by banks will hurt the sector even further,” adds Shen.
A double-edged sword
Lowering the interest rate ceiling has made it untenable for online lenders to lend to higher-risk segments of the market, Shen argues.
By catering to the subprime segment (including borrowers like Ricky, whose credit score is below 500), which both traditional and digital banks intentionally avoid, online lenders are taking a bigger risk.
Consequently, they charge higher interest rates to compensate for the risk of higher default rates.
However, OJK’s new policy effectively shrinks the market for P2P lenders.
“Instead of giving P2P lenders free rein to price their loans, lower interest rates will push P2P lenders to less risky segments of the total addressable market,” Shen explains.

This could reduce default rates, but it could also leave millions underserved. Around 90 million adults in Indonesia remain unbanked.
With a smaller addressable market, online lenders become more constrained in the risks they can take, mirroring traditional loan practices that are typically more rigid.
“This will result in some P2P lenders failing or leaving the industry. And when that happens, the P2P lenders who are left behind will find themselves in a less competitive industry,” Shen says.
Clearly or borderline criminal
Amid tight profit margins and high default rates, online lenders face significant pressure to recover funds owed to them. This pressure, in turn, may lead them to use aggressive tactics to ensure repayment.
According to Shen, questionable debt collection practices began at a time when P2P lending was less regulated, with hundreds of registered and unregistered lenders entering the space.
Some lenders had debt collection practices that were “clearly criminal or that bordered on being criminal,” he notes.
See also: Investors in UangTeman struggle to claw back their money
Though there is more regulation in the space today, these practices have continued.
For example, debt collectors would reportedly make fake food orders to borrowers’ homes, forcing them to pay for the meals.
Other debtors would be at the receiving end of cruel harsh words or threats that their parents would be visited by collectors.
In late 2023, lender AdaKami stirred controversy due to allegations that a customer died by suicide following the actions of debt collectors as well as pressure from high interest rates and service fees.
AdaKami also received 36 customer complaints related to the debt collection process involving fake orders of various services.
However, the company claims that there’s no conclusive evidence linking it to these incidents. The police also did not find any connection between the suicide and online loans, and all complaints have been resolved, AdaKami tells Tech in Asia.
But when confronted with the suicide case in 2023, AdaKami revealed that it was working with collection agents, some of which were allegedly violating standard operating procedures.
Shen compares this to Singapore, where debt collection agencies are licensed and regulated.
Additionally, instead of encouraging people to consume beyond their means, he suggests that online lenders should actively engage with regulators or grassroots institutes to educate people and improve the quality of borrowers.
Despite the complexities, Shen remains optimistic about the long-term prospects of online lending in Indonesia and the industry’s role in driving financial inclusion.
“Wherever you draw a line in the sand, there will be some who cannot comply. And I think that is sort of the natural state of an evolving industry,” he concludes.

Australian employment platform Seek has merged its three major Asia-Pacific job marketplaces: Seek, Jobstreet, and Jobsdb.
According to Peter Bithos, CEO of Seek for Asia, this move would allow the company to more effectively reach more job seekers in Asia Pacific – with a lofty ambition of helping 500 million people connect with the 5 million companies in the region.
To do this, Seek will bring the AI-powered functionalities of its platform to Jobstreet and Jobsdb, according to a statement. These include features that assist employers in assessing potential new hires’ suitability and help job seekers get better job recommendations using AI models.
In turn, the larger data set that the unified platform brings would allow Seek to better refine its AI algorithms, the company added. 
This move comes around a decade after Seek acquired Jobstreet for US$523.5 million and Jobsdb for US$135 million. Since then, Seek said it had invested roughly US$118 million in the platforms’ development.
Citing a Jobstreet report, Seek also said it sees a growing need for talent in Indonesia – with the local market expecting a boost in recruitment and workforce stability.
Recently, Seek launched Jobstreet Express for employers to find “semi-skilled” workers in Singapore – following the launch of similar services in Indonesia in 2022.

PropertyGuru’s listing in NYSE / Photo credit: NYSE

Proptech giant PropertyGuru has laid off 79 employees, or roughly 5% of its workforce.
In a message to employees, CEO Hari V. Krishnan cited changing customer needs and a volatile market in Southeast Asia as the main factors for the strategic shift.
PropertyGuru will shut down non-scalable businesses, including two branches in Vietnam. The company previously noted that revenue growth in Vietnam had been slowing, shown by the 32.8% year-on-year drop in Q3 2023.
The slowdown in the country – which was happening throughout 2023 – came as many projects crawled to a halt in Vietnam and capital continued to be scarce amid market turmoil.
In the letter announcing the layoffs, PropertyGuru also mentioned it will proceed with the plan to completely sunset FastKey, a SaaS product connecting agents with development projects.
Last year, the company announced the closures of Rumah, an online property portal in Indonesia, and FastKey.
While Rumah ceased operations last November, FastKey will be discontinued in Indonesia by July 31, 2024, followed by Malaysia and Singapore by October 15, 2024.
All these actions are aimed at enhancing profitability and ensuring long-term sustainability, PropertyGuru said in the letter.
The firm is also streamlining overall operations by consolidating technology delivery, redesigning customer support roles, and making adjustments to its organizational structure.
Recently, Steve Melhuish, the co-founder of PropertyGuru and its inaugural CEO, stepped down from the company’s board of directors to venture into the climate tech sector.

Hello reader,
Someone recently asked me how I prefer to get bad news from a doctor – sugarcoated or straight to the point?
Fortunately, bar a few torn ligaments and broken fingers, I’ve never really had any truly bad medical diagnoses. But I still had an easy answer – give it to me straight.
I’m a worrier by nature, so I can almost guarantee that whatever the doctor is about to tell me won’t be as bad as what’s going on in my head. Give me the bad news as soon as possible to put my mind at ease, and then let’s fix the problem.
Results for the 2022 financial year weren’t all bad news for Ranelagh – the parent company of Indonesian healthtech platform Alodokter – considering that the firm cut its losses in half. But I’m willing to bet execs and investors were less happy that its revenue growth appears to have stagnated. Hopefully they were given the news without any beating around the bush.
Today we look at:


Alodokter, give it to me straight 
Online lending platform Julo breaking even

Premium summary
Mixed bill of health

The parent company of Alodokter, an Indonesia-based healthtech platform, saw some good news and bad news in its financial results for 2022.
While Ranelagh’s revenue growth stalled with just a 1% increase from 2021 to US$8.5 million, the company trimmed its losses by half over the same period.


To subscribe or not to subscribe?: Alodokter offers various services, including online doctor consultations via subscription or on a one-off basis. While revenue from telemedicine subscriptions still made up the lion’s share of the total for 2022, it declined 20% year on year. On the other hand, revenue from one-off consultations increased 16%.

Trimming the fat: Ranelagh slashed its losses by dramatically decreasing spending in three key areas: employee compensation, advertising and marketing, and freelance doctors. Expenses from these portions of the business fell year on year by 31%, 37%, and 46%, respectively.

By the numbers: Alodokter was founded in 2014 and says it currently has 25 million monthly active users, as well as partnerships with 1,500 hospitals and clinics, 500 pharmacies, and 1,000 doctors as of last year. The firm has secured around US$50 million in total disclosed funding, according to Tech in Asia data.

Julo’s breakeven joy

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Julo achieved operating profit breakeven in December 2023, a key milestone for the Indonesia-based online lending platform.
The fintech firm also recorded a 73% increase in revenue for the 2023 financial year and an annual recurring revenue of over US$120 million, the company said in a statement.


Efficiency gains: The results were thanks to its “sustainable business model and operational efficiency,” the company said. According to a Tech in Asia report last year, which cited an industry source, Julo had exceeded US$100 million in sales.  

Work to do: Julo’s full-year profit figures for 2023 have not been revealed. The company recorded a net loss of around US$25 million for 2022, mainly driven by growing bad debts and rising operating expenses.

Loan ledger: As well as cash loans, Julo provides pay-later options, bills payment services, and student financing. The company disbursed more than US$454 million in loans in 2023, up 50% from 2022.

Ishan Agrawal, ex-CTO of fintech firm Funding Societies, is taking on a new frontier with his new startup: AI.
He has co-founded Branch AI along with former Twitter engineers Govind Chandrasekhar and Praveen Sekar. Backed by Y Combinator, Branch AI is an ecommerce-focused platform that uses large language models (LLMs) and other related tech.
The company highlights that one of the current challenges in ecommerce is the shift toward more conversational search queries. However, many retailers and brands still use keyword search tools, resulting in lost revenue for more specific queries.
Branch AI provides several tools, including those that enhance the quality of tail queries, boost search relevance, and analyze search queries.
These tools can reduce operational complexity and costs associated with search tuning, as well as enhance conversion for long-tail, low-click, and zero-result queries, the company said.
“You don’t need large teams and endless tuning anymore,” explained Agrawal in a LinkedIn post. “Our AI models understand product catalogs and user intents, and automatically tune search relevance.”
Before joining Branch AI’s founding team in July 2023, Agrawal had served at Singapore-based Funding Societies for seven years. He was appointed as the company’s CTO in 2020 until eventually resigning to establish Branch AI.

Hello there,
New York-style pizza tastes like tomato sauce smeared on cardboard. These are fighting words in some areas of the pizza loving world, but I stand by them.
If I really want to start a ruckus with the pro-New York crowd, though, I always drop this bomb: I love pineapple on my pizza. A chicken pizza with feta cheese and cashews is also excellent.
Despite the dominance of pizza snobs such as myself in online discussions, there is a third group of pie-loving people out there: the lunch crowd. They want something to eat, ideally quickly, and without argument about sauces. I may not agree with them, but I can appreciate their “I ordered lunch, not an argument” practicality.
So with that group in mind, we have this week’s Big Story. My colleague Melissa talks to the founder and CEO of GoPizza, a South Korean chain that competes against fast food companies rather than against traditional pizza franchises.
And yes, there is tech involved here. GoPizza uses AI to monitor the topping process, and robots add the condiments and sauces.
After you’ve eaten – definitely not before – you should check out our second Big Story, which looks at the challenges of the insect-for-food industry, which has caused several startups to pivot.
And then finally I’ll tell you about how hallucinating computers wreaked havoc in the business world this week.

AI ODYSSEY
Promising AI projects we’re noticing
When genAI hallucinations court legal woes for companies
The first time I encountered the concept of a hallucinating computer was in the pages of Transmetropolitian, a cyberpunk comic book from the late 1990s.
In one of the first stories, antihero Spider Jerusalem has to deal with a hallucinating home appliance called a maker – basically a highly advanced 3D printer – which was making and consuming its own drugs. Of all the weird and outlandish concepts I’ve read in science-fiction over the years, digital hallucinations was not on my “things I’ll ever cover in real life” bingo card.
Yet, a computer that was apparently off its rocker got Air Canada hauled into court last week.

Image credit: Timmy Loen

An AI-controlled chatbot on the site gave erroneous and apparently made-up information – the plain English definition of an AI having a hallucination – to a traveler named Jake Moffat, who was seeking a bereavement fare. When the traveler followed the chatbot’s instructions, the airline refused to give a refund.
Moffat sued, and Air Canada attempted to defend itself claiming the chatbot was a “separate legal entity that is responsible for its own actions.”
The judge in the case issued a very common sense and non-technical ruling. Just because the information a customer relied on came from an AI-controlled chatbot and not plain text didn’t matter.
Air Canada had put both sets of conflicting data on its website, and it wasn’t the customer’s duty to figure out which one was right. Air Canada owed Moffat the equivalent of US$812.
The offending bot, which Air Canada said was only launched as an experiment, has since been pulled from the website.
The bigger question is whether the case is an anomaly or part of a bigger problem with AI. Just how much hallucinating is going on out there?
A study that came out just last month from Stanford University seems to suggest that hallucination rates can sometimes reach horrific levels.
The study, written by Stanford RegLab and the Institute for Human-Centered AI, said that hallucination rates for “specific legal queries for state-of-the-art language models” range from 69% to 88%.
While the authors of the Stanford paper make it clear that their research is limited to legal issues, AI-startup Vectara has compiled a leaderboard of the hallucination rates for general AI programs.
ChatGPT-4 comes in with a 3% hallucination rate, the best ranking on the list. Google’s Flan-T5 pulls up the rear with a 15.8% rate.
Why is there a huge difference between these rates and those reported by Stanford? The study found that an AI’s performance deteriorates when dealing with more complex tasks that require a “nuanced understanding” of the issues.
Building an LLM that understands these nuanced relationships in complex systems is something that genAI companies will have to work toward.
But the more immediate question for the AI industry and businesses in general is one we’d never have to ask if real people were involved: What is the acceptable level of hallucinations?
As far as I can find, no one has been able to draw a line between hallucination rates and monetary losses. Unfortunately, that data will probably only come after more cases of genAI-created financial damage.

Going for deferred payments can prove to be beneficial for B2B companies and their clients. Investors also agree, with B2B buy now, pay later platforms like Playter and Mondu raising eight-digit funding rounds recently.
However, Singapore-based fintech firm Fluid found that some businesses are still apprehensive about deferred payments due to their complexity and the risks associated with credit terms.
The company aims to solve this issue with its platform, which enables businesses to get paid faster and offer flexible payment options to their customers.
Fluid recently raised US$5.2 million in a series A round led by Insignia Ventures Partners. It aims to use the funds to expand its risk and engineering teams and onboard larger suppliers to its platform.
The startup was founded in early 2023 by CEO Trasy Lou Walsh, CPO Steven Li, and CFO Ruoyun Yang. They collectively bring experiences from companies like Atome, Uber, Coupang Pay, Lendable, and the International Finance Corporation.
In a statement, Walsh said that by using Fluid, suppliers no longer need to engage with debt providers, undergo credit checks for buyers, or hire a large team for settlement and reconciliation.
This recent investment round brings Fluid’s total funds raised to US$7 million. It previously secured US$1.8 million in seed funding from Iterative and New Stack Ventures.

We get paid by the hour, so we actually work harder.”
That’s how Danny Castonguay describes the people behind Bld.ai, a Singapore-based platform specializing in digital professional services.

Bld.ai co-founder and CEO Danny Castonguay / Photo credit: Danny Castonguay

The co-founder and CEO isn’t just referring to the mercs – actually a network of 500 partners – on Bld.ai. Along with the company’s executives and board members, Castonguay himself works as a contractor on the platform.
Launched in 2017, Bld.ai has been profitable since 2022. It has a few simple rules for staying in the black: Charge by the hour; be very careful about who you lend to; and only work as contractors, even at the CEO level.
The combination may sound unrealistic, but it has allowed Bld.ai to post S$14 million (US$10.4 million) in revenue and S$3 million (US$2.2 million) in operating profit (EBITDA) in 2022, Castonguay tells Tech in Asia. The bootstrapped company says it posted similar figures in 2023.
Bld.ai’s network is made up of independent partners who sell, resell, and trade services such as engineering, product management, legal work, accounting, and even investment banking. Some partners also sell licenses for software (SaaS) while some work as consultants.
The partners range from individual freelancers to sizable companies with hundreds of employees that work in various fields including mining, healthcare, banking, and oil and gas.
Essentially, Bld.ai aims to offer services on par with major consultancy firms such as McKinsey &amp; Company, Accenture, Deloitte, and Infosys, but at much reduced costs.
“As a client of Bld.ai, you get the benefit of the quality and scale of hiring large professional services firms, but at lower prices than hiring individuals or even direct engagement with boutique consulting companies,” Castonguay explains.
He adds that the company’s success comes from its ability to keep overhead costs, such as employment, low.
“The large corporations have lots of overhead, with about 25% of whatever a client pays going to the back office,” he says. “They’re robber barons – they charge incredibly high margins for the value that they bring.”
Amazon-like professional services
Castonguay is in a position to know – he worked for McKinsey for over seven years.
“It’s an extremely profitable business that justifies its exorbitant fees because the difference between good advice and great advice can be easily counted in tens of millions of dollars,” he says of his former employer.

The Bld.ai team / Photo credit: Danny Castonguay

However, he also pointed out that in big corporate environments, it’s impossible to prioritize scaling, quality, and cutting costs. “As a result, I saw an opportunity to create an Amazon.com-like infrastructure, but focused on delivering high-quality [but] low-cost professional services.”
To curb overhead costs, Bld.ai has been investing in Flow, a back-office automation platform that provides the startup’s partners with a self-service interface.
Part of the automation includes an audit system, which evaluates and scores all projects that come through Bld.ai’s network. This system uses third parties – usually another partner who isn’t involved in the project – to come in and check the work. The data collected is then analyzed using AI.
While Bld.ai does use AI on both its Flow network and in the auditing process, it is mainly used as a co-pilot. There is always a human in the loop, Castonguay stressed.
The goal is to use the analysis to make sure projects are priced properly and to detect if there are partners that might need to be weeded out of the Bld.ai network.
Lost money
When Castonguay was developing the idea for his business, he initially pitched the idea to McKinsey but was turned down. He eventually established Bld.ai with his wife, Leah Grace Capitan, and Eric Tambasacan, one of his former clients.
Capitan is Bld.ai’s product manager while Tambasacan is CEO of Mahusai, a mobile and web development and design firm in the Philippines.

Co-founder and CEO Danny Castonguay and other bld.ai partners near Lake Michigan / Photo credit: Danny Castonguay

Bld.ai started out by pitching to startups. Castonguay was one of the founders of Kalibrr, a Y Combinator-backed jobs marketplace, so he began by selling to a few of his batchmates from the 2013 cohort.
But it was word of mouth that led to a relationship with VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (A16z), whose executives were surprised at how little they were charged by Bld.ai.
“In 2020, Bld.ai had a team who did DevOps for a company,” Castonguay says. “And the running rate for the work that we did was US$250 an hour. We were charging US$30.”
Castonguay, however, admits that mistakes were made along the way.
Bld.ai did not focus on growth and marketing, prioritizing efficiency instead. It also allowed some startups to accumulate unpaid invoices on the promise that their series A, B, or C funding was imminent.
“Historically, startups have been the ones where we’ve lost money,” he says. “So on the US$40 million that’s currently on our platform that we’ve invoiced, we probably have not collected about US$700,000.” All of those losses have come from startups.
Castonguay says that 30% of Bld.ai’s existing customer are startups, with the majority of revenue coming from large clients.
“Big corporations are more than half of our revenue,” he notes. “We’ve definitely made mistakes and lost money, but never more than our monthly revenue. We have never had a month where our costs exceeded our cash generation. We have never taken debt, nor have we taken outsized risks.”
As a result, Bld.ai does not accept equity payments and will not engage in work with fixed costs or fixed scopes. Clients pay by the hour.
“I’ve always been a conservative person who respects the importance of a healthy cash flow and managing debt,” Castonguay says.
But that might be about to change, to a small degree.
Looking for “smart capital”
Following the last two years of profitability, Bld.ai aims to triple its sales in 2024 and scale its network to over 1 million clients by 2029. Expanding its network could mean that the company needs to bring in more investors.
According to Castonguay, creating a stable cash flow was his focus when he launched the company. However, he believes that now is a good time to attract “some smart capital.”
“What we need most as entrepreneurs is time and advice. So when looking for partners, I seek those who will help save me time and provide wisdom,” the CEO says.
If Bld.ai succeeds in scaling its network, Castonguay thinks revenue could reach up to US$40 billion annually.
As he puts it: “I believe it’s entirely achievable and conceivable that companies born in the age of AI automation will grow to be larger and more efficient than existing incumbents such as Accenture, Deloitte, Tata Consultancy Services, and Infosys.”

Singapore-based Shein is reportedly considering relocating its financial debut from New York to London.
The shift comes as the ultra-fast fashion retailer, which was founded in China, believes its IPO plans would not be approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), sources told Bloomberg.
Besides London, the company is also considering Hong Kong or Singapore as new locations for its IPO. Notably, Shein founder and CEO Chris Xu is a permanent Singapore resident.
Earlier this month, US Senator Marco Rubio urged the SEC to prevent Shein from listing. He said that the company should provide more information about its operations in China. There was also a request to investigate Shein’s cotton supply from Xinjiang by a US Congress member last year.
In November 2023, Shein confidentially filed for a US IPO. It was already facing regulatory scrutiny at the time, with politicians urging the SEC to investigate the firm’s potential use of forced labor.

Achmad Zaky, founder and ex-CEO of Bukalapak, has backed the seed round of Komerce, an Indonesian company that offers end-to-end ecommerce solutions for local SMEs.
He invested alongside 500 Global in the ecommerce firm’s seed funding round – further details of which were kept undisclosed.
Komerce was founded in 2020 by Nofi Bayu Darmawan, with co-founders Syaefullah Syeif and Satriyo Budi Utomo joining in 2021. The solutions it offers include remote teams for ecommerce development, e-fulfillment, and customer relationship management, among others.
The startup has 25,000 SMEs in its ecosystem, which recorded over 2 million transactions in 2023.
Claiming to have achieved profitability since early last year, Komerce also said it recorded a 300% year-over-year revenue growth throughout 2023.
Darmawan said the funding will be used to develop products and expand into new markets. These plans come as ecommerce penetration in Indonesia – which was at 32.1% in 2023 – is estimated to touch 46.5% by 2028.

In the Philippines, a staggering 99.5% of all businesses are SMEs. As of last year, 67% of local SMEs grappled with credit constraints – a lot of business owners found the friction that comes with traditional bank loans too much of a hassle.
One startup looking to solve this issue is ProCredit, a Filipino lending firm that engages business owners with its senior decision-makers from the get-go.
The company has raised US$4.1 million in a pre-seed round led by Integra Partners, with participation from the Menardo Jimenez Family Office, M Venture Partners (MVP), Cento Ventures, Gobi-Core Philippine Fund, and angel investors.
With its business model, ProCredit helps eliminate the need for the usual layered decision-making process of submitting applications and speaking with administrative channels or agents.
It also conducts physical visits to customers’ places of business, reducing the risk of bad loans.
ProCredit plans to expand its loan book to raise additional capital, the company said in a statement. It is eyeing to enter the banking sector, given the founders’ extensive experience managing lending operations in regulated banks.  This would allow ProCredit to offer “a fuller suite of lending solutions” to its customers, the company added.
Founded in 2023, ProCredit has a founding team consisting of former executives from the likes of Citigroup, Standard Chartered, ANZ, and the Asian Development Bank.

Hello readers,
I first learned about GoPizza, a tech-enabled pizza chain from South Korea, while watching a Korean variety show called Sixth Sense.
Starring some famous celebrities, like comedian and host Yoo Jae-suk, the show revolved around the cast visiting three locations and trying to figure out which one is a fake, playing games to gain clues and exchanging silly banter.
GoPizza was obviously not the fake in the episode it featured in, because it’s the focus of today’s premium story. And here at Tech in Asia, we write about very real things.
The pizza chain has seen tremendous growth since I first saw it on TV – it currently has more than 200 stores in seven markets in Asia, and it opened six new branches in Singapore in December 2023 alone.
Despite GoPizza’s prevalence, however, its rapid expansion raises questions about the sustainability of its business. My colleague Melissa goes deeper in today’s premium story.
Today we look at:


GoPizza’s tech-powered growth  
A startup that makes coffee without coffee beans 
Other newsy highlights such as Grab’s profitable Q4 2023 and Revolut Singapore’s rising revenue


Premium summary

GoPizza, which was founded by Jay Lim in 2016, started out as a food truck in South Korea. It serves rectangular pizzas that are the “perfect size” for an individual portion, which developed to meet a rising demand for single-person pizza servings.
Now, it has over 200 stores in seven Asian markets. The firm has raised US$50 million from investors to date. Among its backers are some of South Korea’s biggest conglomerates.
Let’s take a closer look at the company.


Quick and easy: The startup uses patented ovens that bake its pizzas in under five minutes and a specially formulated “par-baked” dough that removes the need for kneading in stores. Robots sprinkle condiments and drizzle sauces while humans only need to handle toppings and place the pizzas into ovens. AI is also used to monitor the process and ensure consistency and quality.

Heating up: Competition in the category of grab-and-go pizzas will likely ramp up as more players integrate tech into their operations. Already, there’s South Korean chain, EatPizza, offering similarly priced, shaped, and value-for-money pizzas, with over 100 stores in its home market, that’s made its foray into Southeast Asia. To further stand out from the crowd, GoPizza may need to leverage tech beyond just optimizing operations.

Flash in the pan: GoPizza’s rapid growth seems reminiscent of coffee chain Flash Coffee, which expanded quickly and had to exit Singapore as a result. However, Lim is confident in GoPizza’s position in the market, adding that he expects the company to become EBITDA positive this year.

Startup/News spotlight
No beans? No problem

Fun fact: I don’t drink coffee. The caffeine gives me palpitations. However, I will admit that few things smell as good as a freshly brewed cup of coffee, which is why I do get decaf on occasion (mostly in my pumpkin spice lattes).
As such, I’m really intrigued by Prefer, a coffee startup whose brews aren’t made with coffee beans. It just raised US$2 million in seed money.


From leftovers to lattes:  To make its bean-free coffee, Prefer upcycles certain kinds of food such as leftover bread and soy pulp, which it uses to reverse-engineer coffee’s “key aroma molecules,” says the company. Its products are decaffeinated by default, but it adds caffeine powder to blends if necessary to meet customer needs. 

Good growth: Having only launched three months ago, the startup has already logged 2x month-on-month growth in sales, according to founder Jake Berber. Later this year, Prefer plans to expand across Southeast Asia through a partnership with Philippine coffee chain Pickup Coffee, one of its investors in the seed round.

What’s brewing: Prefer will use the funds to increase its production capacity. In the long term, it hopes to offer other products such as cacao, vanilla, and hazelnut.

Quick bytes
1️⃣ Gotta go fast
Electric vehicle manufacturer VinFast recorded US$1.2 billion in revenue for 2023, a year-on-year increase of 91%. The Vietnam-based firm attributed the result to higher sales volumes and an improved product mix.
2️⃣ Black, not green
Grab reported US$11 million in profit for Q4 2023 – the first time the Singapore-based firm logged a profitable quarter. The company pointed to an improved group adjusted EBITDA and reduced share-based compensation expenses as some of the reasons for getting in the black.
3️⃣ Confusion for customers
Users of DCS Card Centre – formerly known as Diners Club Singapore – were left frustrated and confused after the company implemented changes to its services. Some customers reported that they weren’t notified about the changes beforehand and that emails and calls to DCS Card Centre’s customer service went unanswered.
4️⃣ Revolut on the rise
The UK-headquartered fintech firm grew its revenue in Singapore by over 2x between 2022 and 2023. According to Revolut Singapore CEO Raymond Ng, the result was driven by the rebound in travel following the pandemic.

The Singapore Fintech Association (SFA) has partnered with two Malaysian VC firms, Artem Ventures and OSK Ventures International (OSKVI), to launch Project Tapir, which aims to promote the expansion of Singapore-based fintech firms into the neighboring country.
1337 Ventures, another Malaysian VC firm, will also act as a “secondary partner” to this initiative, SFA said in a statement, though it did not elaborate on what that would entail.
The association will be tasked to identify promising firms for Malaysian expansion, which it plans to start in May. The new project will target companies operating in the payments, insurtech, AI, and emerging technologies sectors, among others.
In the second half of 2023, AI companies focusing on fintech in Singapore saw a 77% year-on-year increase in funding, while the crypto and insurtech sectors experienced an 86% and 25% decrease in investments, respectively, according to KPMG.
According to the statement, Project Tapir will also help showcase Malaysia as an attractive location for foreign investments.
“Artem Ventures and OSKVI both have deep expertise in the Malaysian Fintech space, and we hope this latest initiative will support our members and positively impact both the economic and talent markets in both countries,” SFA president Shadab Taiyabi said.

Julo, an Indonesia-based online lending platform, hit operating profit breakeven in December 2023. It also recorded a 73% increase in revenue for the 2023 financial year and an annual recurring revenue of over US$120 million, the company said in a statement.
In its statement, the company attributed the results to its “sustainable business model and operational efficiency.”
A Tech in Asia report in October 2023, citing an industry source, revealed that Julo had surpassed US$100 million in sales as it moved closer to profitability.
It’s unclear how the company’s operating profit stood for the full year. In 2022, however, Julo logged a net loss of 390 billion rupiah (around US$25 million) – up 488% year on year – according to Alternatives.pe, which tracks regulatory filings. This was mainly driven by growing bad debts and rising operating expenses.
Julo, which targets middle-income borrowers, said it has a cohort retention rate of over 70%, which “dramatically” lowers loan acquisition costs.
The company, which has over 2 million users as of October last year, told Tech in Asia that its active users avail of its services around 10 to 12 times per year. “This has been a key driver of our growth which will continue to deliver well past 2024,” Julo added.
The company disbursed over US$454 million in loans in 2023, a 50% increase compared to the previous year. Its total loan disbursements since its 2016 launch have crossed US$1 billion.
Besides cash loans, Julo also provides pay-later options, bills payment services, and student financing.
According to Tech in Asia data, the firm has raised US$95 million in total funding to date from investors like Credit Saison, Gobi Partners, East Ventures, and AC Ventures.

“With every new product line over the past 12 months, we’ve seen an incremental uplift in AUM,” says Gregory Van, co-founder and CEO of fintech firm Endowus.
Michele Ferrario, co-founder and chief executive of investment platform StashAway, says that the company “saw quite significant AUM growth, particularly in the second part of 2023.”
Endowus has said it now has over US$5 billion in AUM in Singapore and Hong Kong, while rival Syfe has over US$1 billion in Singapore alone. StashAway declined to disclose its current AUM, but it crossed the US$1 billion threshold in 2021.
Current customers were the main driver of AUM growth for both Syfe and StashAway.
Flight to safety
As interest rates remained high, customers started placing money into cash management products last year, said Dhruv Arora, founder and chief executive of Syfe. The company’s Cash+ Guaranteed offering, a fixed deposit product, drew new customers.
“Our average user was somewhere between late 20s and 40s, but with the Cash+ Guaranteed, we started attracting users in their 50s and 60s as well,” Arora says.

Syfe’s Cash+ Guaranteed product / Image credit: Syfe

The flight to safety by investors has led to platforms launching new solutions. Endowus released offerings such as index funds by asset manager Amundi for Central Provident Fund savings.
All the platforms also rolled out more products for accredited investors – with financial assets exceeding S$1 million (US$745,000) or an annual income of more than S$300,000 (US$223,000) – such as hedge funds, venture capital funds, and angel investment syndicate investments.
The mass affluent, commonly defined as customers with at least S$250,000 (US$186,000) in assets, is a key segment for all wealth management platforms.
But while players say business is growing, they have yet to show profitability, according to their most recent financial filings.
Financial reports for Endowus show revenue growing 151.5% to S$8.3 million (US$6.2 million) in 2022. However, its losses also swelled 51.4% to S$26.8 million (US$19.9 million) in the same period.
StashAway’s revenue in 2022 rose 13.6% to S$9.2 million (US$6.8 million). Meanwhile, its losses narrowed to S$27 million in 2022 from S$30.6 million (US$22.8 million) the year before.
Syfe shifted its financial year to end on March 31 and posted higher revenue for FY2023 at S$4.2 million (US$3.1 million). Its FY2022, which comprised of a 15-month period, pulled in S$2.5 million (US$1.9 million) in revenue. Losses narrowed for FY2023 to S$9.9 million (US$7.4 million) compared to S$21.1 million (US$15.7 million) for the 15-month period of FY2022.
“Over the last two years, we’ve been more focused than we were before because the company’s reaching a maturity where it makes sense to focus on getting to profitability, and we’re not far away,” says StashAway’s Ferrario.

StashAway CEO Michele Ferrario (center) with his co-founders Nino Ulsamer (left) and Freddy Lim (right) / Photo credit: StashAway

Syfe claims its Singapore business is on track to be profitable by 2024, with the broader business in Hong Kong and Australia expected to achieve profitability within 2025.
Syfe also launched a brokerage business in January 2022, which has helped in providing another revenue stream. The platform’s brokerage business saw transaction volume peak in December last year, hitting 50% higher than the last peak in November 2023. Arora declined to disclose specifics on the transaction volume.
These different business lines have helped in building Syfe’s resiliency amid the uncertainty and volatility in the market. The brokerage charges transaction fees rather than a percentage of a customer’s AUM.
Focus on existing markets
All three platforms will concentrate on the markets they are already in, rather than looking to enter a new one in 2024.
StashAway will be doubling down in its current five markets: Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Hong Kong, and Dubai.
Meanwhile, Syfe is looking to take what has worked in Singapore to its other markets in Hong Kong and Australia. Arora notes that there has been interest from larger financial institutions to partner up for its offerings.
“We had some interest from larger financial institutions regionally to enable their offerings in their markets, but for us, the focus is these three markets and that will remain,” he says.

For Endowus, Hong Kong will take centre stage this year. “Our convictions about the need and demand for our service has only grown since we launched the platform in the region in mid-2023, as our first expansion market after our home base in Singapore,” says CEO Van.

Hi readers,
Once upon a time, in a magical forest, there lived a beautiful creature called a unicorn. Its coat sparkled like a rainbow, and it had a long, twisted horn on its head.
The unicorn danced through the forest, its hooves barely touching the ground. Its mane and tail flowed in the wind like waterfalls.
It was a symbol of beauty, magic, and wonder.
And then came Aileen Lee, a venture capitalist at Cowboy Ventures. Over a decade ago, she named the startups valued at US$1 billion or more as unicorns, thereby turning one of the most lively words in internet history into a not-as-exciting investment term.
In 2021, there was an impressive growth in the number of unicorns (the boring ones) in Southeast Asia. From five the previous year, the total count climbed to 26.
The timing was perfect; it was one of the most optimistic years for the region. But recently, many of those unicorns have lost the title upon reevaluation.
Startups like the crypto exchange Bitkub and the game developer Sky Mavis saw their valuations plummet, while others chose to go public, losing the status of unicorns as a result.
Since we began tracking unicorns in 2021, the count has decreased from 51 to 38. In 2023, only one new unicorn emerged, and in the first two months of 2024, another one, Silicon Box, was identified.
Now that the investing scene is becoming interesting again, it’d be fun to watch how the population of unicorns grows.

Hello reader,
One of the biggest things I’ve had to learn to do since graduating from university is money management. Often seen as some kind of “adulting,” this is a process that has taken up lots of my time in terms of research.
To be honest, I wish there was a little more that the school system had done to teach students about things like this. Considering different types of investments and savings options can be a long and drawn-out process, since you have to weigh those options against your current and future needs.
My fiancee and I have been looking around for a joint savings account recently. During this process, the topic of digital banks came up. I had the impression that they usually give really good rates to attract new customers, especially since these firms are much younger than traditional banks.
While we haven’t made my final decision on whether to put our money in a digital bank, it seems like others have already come to a conclusion – taking the form of this week’s largest deal, which saw several investors pump capital into a Singapore-based digital bank.

Behind the Glasswall
Fundraising often involves reaching out to multiple contacts, many of whom founders might not have dealt with before. To provide some transparency to this process, we created Glasswall, a platform for founders to give feedback and recommendations on investors. Check out the full list here.

✅︎ “They give us direct feedback and guide us in the right direction. Exactly what we need as early stage founders. They expect complete transparency so please do not withhold information as they can help overcome obstacles.” – on Forge Ventures 
❌ “To be fair, I think Insignia probably did something right to be one of the top few VCs in Singapore but this probably got into their head a little. The overall experience is that they see themselves as “elite” and you need to fit a certain persona to get funding from them. Think your tech bros but Singapore version.” – on Insignia Ventures Partners 
✅︎ “We appreciate the rigorous DD that Openspace did on our business. We felt that this was a signal that once they are onboard as an investor they will work hard to add value, which has proven to be the case. Through the process the were very responsive, very professional and well organised and in the end willing to be flexible where it was important to us. Even though their DD feels very thorough for an early stage business, at the end of the day they do understand that there is still a lot to be figured out.” – on Openspace

Thoughtful reads
1️⃣ Keep calm and carry on
I’m not the best at telling when someone is in a bad mood, so there have been instances when tensions ran a bit high. In such situations, communication is key, but there’s also a small margin for error. This article on Harvard Business Review lays everything out a little more clearly.
2️⃣ Are you… sure?
Insurtech funding around the world dropped last year, which may worry many stakeholders in the space. Jonathan Low, partner and co-founder of consultancy firm Predictiv, says that while investors may still like the tech, the key thing with this vertical is to have patience. You can read more of his thoughts in his blog post here.
3️⃣ Securing the right heads
It’s an age-old question: How do you get the right talent, especially when it comes to the executive level? Listen to this podcast episode on Andreessen Horowitz’s site if you’d like to learn more about it.
4️⃣ Double-edged sword
A couple of weeks ago, there was a huge scandal on X (formerly Twitter) when several deepfaked photos of Taylor Swift were released. It spoke to how AI, as good as it can be, can also negatively affect anyone no matter how big or powerful they are. That said, the answer to this problem could lie within the very same technology. Listen to this podcast to learn more.
5️⃣ Extending the right hand
If you’re an early-stage startup, this one’s for you. Angel investors and other individual or private investors may behave very differently from VCs. How can you, as an early-stage founder, reach out to them effectively? Here’s some thoughts from one such angel investor himself.","Uno Digital Bank, RentoMojo, Newmo, and more raised funds this week.",Jonathan Chew,Edited by Dhania Putri Sarahtika,open,0,"",https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/1680679379_Newsletter-GIF-Winner-winner-payments-dinner-1200x640-1.gif,false,"",false,true,false,true,false,6,,1284,Singapore and India deal a one-two punch this week,"Uno Digital Bank, RentoMojo, Newmo, and more raised funds this week.",,,"","",""

Byju’s, the troubled edtech giant, is facing a lawsuit filed by its own backers.
Four major investors – Prosus, GA, Sofina, and Peak XV – have filed a petition with India’s National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) seeking to remove founder Byju Raveendran and his wife, Divya Gokulnath, from leadership positions in the firm due to alleged oppression and mismanagement.
According to media reports, the investors also want to void a recently announced fundraising effort. In January, Byju’s said it plans to raise US$200 million via rights issue, bringing its total valuation down to US$230 million – a significant drop from its all-time high of US$22 billion.
Byju’s loss of control over test prep subsidiary Aakash was also cited in the NCLT filing. In 2023, US-based investment fund Davidson Kempner Capital Management (DK) took control of Aakash and its accounts, reportedly accusing Byju’s of financial misconduct.
The NCLT petition was filed after Byju’s faced a showdown in a crucial extraordinary general meeting (EGM) called by a group of dissatisfied investors.
Media reports say that investors took charge as Byju’s leaders were absent from the gathering. The investors discussed financial mismanagement issues such as a US$1.2 billion loan default. They also brought up leadership failures and a lack of transparency with shareholders and in the company.
However, unknown people allegedly tried to sabotage the EGM through various means, including impersonating the India-based company’s investors. Byju’s management called the meeting “invalid” and had attempted to block it by suing the investors.

Mastery of the English language is considered a boon to job seekers’ employability in Southeast Asia. A 2023 study found this to be true in Vietnam, with some students enrolling in private English classes to widen their career prospects.
One company that helps students meet this need is NativeX. Established in April 2023, the online English-learning platform offers live classes taught by foreign experts.
The edtech startup has recently wrapped up its seed round by raising US$2.5 million, which brought the total to US$4 million. Ansible Ventures and Blueprint Ventures co-led the round, with participation from Northstar Ventures and other investors.
Its system groups students based on their proficiency levels and schedules. NativeX told Tech in Asia that these personalized learning paths help it stand out against companies with similar offerings.
According to NativeX, its paying students spend 15 million Vietnamese dong (US$608.8) in course fees on average.
“This places NativeX in the highest premium segment compared to all online English teaching competitors and in the upper-middle segment compared to offline teaching competitors,” the company said.
The company added that half of its users are working professionals with financial means and experience, who hail from areas like IT, healthcare, marketing, and business.
Planning to spend 80% of the new funds on product enhancement, NativeX is preparing to launch a dual learning program in June. It is going to combine English conversation lessons and soft skills training, said Ai Chau, co-founder and academic head at NativeX.
“The goal of NativeX is to provide students with English skills in a real work environment rather than just a certificate,” the company said.

Hello readers,
Have you ever eaten an insect?
I have; it was a cricket. But there was no adventure or novelty to it because it was deep-fried to the ninth circle of hell.
It was also just a small snack. I can’t imagine insects completely replacing chicken or pork as a source of protein.
That appears to be the general sentiment of the market and government regulators as well, causing many insect-for-food firms to pivot to other ways of selling the biomaterials of their “livestock.”
Today we look at:

The necessary business changes insect-related firms are making
Alodokter’s latest fundraise
Other newsy highlights such as Nvidia’s record numbers and the US$1 billion funding of a Chinese genAI firm

Using every part of the buffalo

As a child, I was always encouraged to finish my grub, down to the last rice grain. While I certainly see the virtue of that thinking, it also inadvertently led to the slight dietary issues I have today, where I find myself compelled to finish everything on my plate, even if I’d already had my fill.
But, again, the no-waste approach is an important one in a world where sustainability is a growing concern. And apparently this is also true in the insect products industry, where firms are looking for alternative sales channels after insect-for-food offerings have failed to take off thus far.


”Biomaterials” is such a metal word: Singapore-based Insectta is one example. It pivoted away from insect farming and into the production of biomaterials like chitosan and melanin in 2019. Chitosan is used in a wide range of products, including disinfectants, cholesterol supplements, and antifungal creams. Melanin could potentially be used in bone regeneration scaffolds to help cells proliferate as well as in energy storage devices to power electronics.

Like toy soldiers: Meanwhile, Malaysia-based Nutrition Technologies now produces animal feed and fertilizer from black soldier fly larvae and feces. Black soldier flies have very active immune systems, and products derived from these flies are therefore beneficial to animal and plant health.

Got to think bigger: Even Altimate Nutrition, a company making cricket protein bars and powder that has obtained on-paper approval to sell its products in the UK, has plans to leverage insects’ medicinal properties.

1️⃣ This panda’s not going anywhere (for now)
Delivery Hero has pulled the plug on discussions with “the main negotiating counterpart” in the sale of its Foodpanda business in select Southeast Asian markets.
The company remains open to M&amp;A talks, but it will only proceed with negotiations “where it can create value to shareholders and with high certainty of closing.”
2️⃣ One BILLION dollars!
Moonshot AI, a genAI firm whose smart chatbot Kimi Chat is built on its proprietary large language model, has secured over US$1 billion in funding spearheaded by Alibaba and HongShan, the Chinese spin-off of US venture capital firm Sequoia Capital.
This brings the firm’s valuation to US$2.5 billion.
3️⃣ Lender x Lender
Helicap, a Singapore-based alternative lending startup, has teamed up with Indonesia’s Bank Danamon to become a “one-stop solution for non-dilutive growth capital.”
In a statement, the companies said they aim to cater to the debt financing needs of nonbank firms in Indonesia, “from seed funding to IPO.” Targets include fintech businesses, alternative lenders, and MSMEs across segments like ecommerce and supply chain.

Photo credit: Grab

In its latest earnings call – coming after it reported its first net profitable quarter – Grab discussed the reason why it is not acquiring Germany-based Delivery Hero’s Foodpanda business, saying that the price would need to be very low for the deal to make sense.
This is because Grab is confident in their current strategy and doesn’t see a pressing need to acquire more assets.
“As we were indicating in our comments, in food deliveries we are more than double the size now of the next largest competitor in Southeast Asia,” Grab COO Alex Hungate said during the call when pressed on why the company was not interested in the Foodpanda acquisition.
While the exec did not specifically name its closest competitor, he most likely referred to Indonesia’s GoTo Group.
Hungate added that Grab achieved its market lead in food delivery by efficiently managing its operations at a large scale, which has led to lower costs and better service for customers.
“And therefore the bar for any inorganic use of shareholder funds has to be very high in comparison with that. And so in the end, any asset that we would acquire would have to be available at a very attractive price to cross that bar,” he said.
In September last year, Delivery Hero was reportedly considering selling part of its Southeast Asian business for US$1.1 billion as part of its efforts to achieve profitability.
The German firm has not disclosed the parties it was talking with, but business outlet Wirtschaftswoche named Grab as a prospective buyer.
Recently, Delivery Hero CEO Niklas Östberg confirmed that discussions about the sale fell through.
The company reported 10.5 billion euros (US$11.4 billion) in total segment revenues and 253.3 million euros (US$274.2 million) in positive adjusted EBITDA in FY 2023.
Meanwhile, Grab turned a loss of US$391 million in Q4 2022 into a profit of US$11 million in Q4 2023.
For the full year, “we generated over US$11 billion of earnings for our driver and merchant partners, which is an all-time high,” said CEO Anthony Tan during the call.
The company’s board recently approved an up to US$500 million share repurchase plan for its class A ordinary shares, which could signal the company’s confidence in its stock price rising.
However, shares of Grab had last closed down 8.4%, as its forecasted revenues for 2024 were lower than analyst expectations.

Orbit Startups Managing General Partner William Bao Bean / Photo credit: SOSV

Orbit Startups has revealed its new batch of portfolio companies from its latest cohort.
The VC firm, which commands over US$180 million in assets, has invested in six companies from different industries – including Web3, ecommerce, and healthtech.
Three of the six startups primarily cater to underserved or untapped markets. One of them is Nigeria-based Scalex, which offers a B2B Web3 payment infrastructure to help businesses in Africa transact in both crypto and fiat currencies.
Meanwhile, ​Pakistan-based MedIQ Smart Healthcare, which connects patients with care providers, focuses on the Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan areas.
And United Arab Emirates-based Revent serves the MENA region with its circular marketplace for gadgets.
Orbit Startups gives its portfolio companies a US$180,000 initial investment and then access to more capital later on. It also helps these companies with partnerships, business development, fundraising, and growth.
It was established in 2010 as a program by SOSV and has since invested a total of US$70 million in startups globally.

Its revenue for the year stood at US$8.5 million, increasing by just 1% compared to 2021, according to Alternatives.pe, which tracks regulatory filings in Singapore.
But Ranelagh, which owns Alodokter Teknologi Solusi, cut its losses by half over the same period.

In an email response to questions from Tech in Asia, Alodokter CEO Nathanael Faibis said that the numbers “do not represent the full structure of the company,” without elaborating further.
As this article was published, he had not replied to our request to provide more details.

Alodokter co-founders Suci Arumsari (left) and Nathanael Faibis / Photo credit: Alodokter

Revenue up, revenue down
In 2022, 89% of Ranelagh’s revenue came from web advertising and telemedicine services.
The former takes the form of display advertising and sponsored articles, while the latter refers to customers consulting with a doctor through the platform, whether on a one-time or subscription basis.
While telemedicine subscriptions remained the largest share of revenue in 2022, it declined by 20% year on year. In contrast, revenue from one-time telemedicine consultations rose by 16% over the same period, and revenue from web advertising grew by 29%.

Other sources of revenue include doctor booking (where it charges hospitals for patient referrals), commission from insurance, and e-pharmacy.

Significant cuts in expenses
The narrowing in losses for 2022 is a result of Ranelagh’s expense reduction efforts across almost every category.
Its three biggest expense categories – employee compensation, advertising and marketing, and freelance doctors – fell year on year by 31%, 37%, and 46%, respectively.
The halving of losses was also reflected in the company’s cash flows, with its net cash used in operating activities declining by 56% over the same period.

However, financing cash inflows also fell by 49% compared to the previous year, resulting in Ranelagh’s cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2022 falling to US$5.2 million.

Ranelagh’s independent auditor noted that as of December 2022, the company’s current liabilities exceeded its current assets by US$9.3 million, and that there was “material uncertainty” as to the company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
A better year?
However, since then, Alodokter has taken steps to strengthen its financial position. This includes the issuance of new convertible shares worth US$6 million to Optima Health, a UK-based occupational health and wellbeing provider, in June 2023, which was reflected in the filing as an event subsequent to the reporting period.
Earlier this week, Alodokter raised US$5.2 million from HL Mando, a South Korea-based automotive manufacturer, and Beacon Venture Capital, the corporate VC unit of Thailand’s Kasikornbank, the Indonesian firm confirmed to Tech in Asia.

With this latest fundraise, Alodokter has secured around US$50 million in total disclosed funding, according to Tech in Asia data. Its past investors include Sequis Life, Golden Gate Ventures, 500 Global, and Marubeni.
In July 2023, Alodokter acquired Diary Bunda, a health platform in Indonesia that helps mothers track their pregnancy. The subsidiary’s contribution to the group’s financial performance will only be reflected in the following year’s filings.
Alodokter anticipates raising its telemedicine prices while simultaneously lowering doctor-related costs. It also wants to grow its e-pharmacy business through the Aloshop platform.

VinFast, the Vietnam-based electric cars manufacturer, reported US$437 million in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023. This brings its total revenue for the financial year ending December 31, 2023 to US$1.2 billion – a 91% boost from a year ago.
The company, a subsidiary of Vietnamese conglomerate Vingroup, attributed the increase to higher sales volumes and an improved product mix. VinFast delivered 34,855 EVs – a whopping 374% year-on-year upsurge – and 72,468 e-scooters throughout 2023.
Net loss was US$2.3 billion in 2023, representing an increase of 14.7% from 2022. For the quarter, the figure stood at US$650 million, a rise of 1.3% year on year.
Meanwhile, its gross loss reached US$174.9 million in Q4 2023, adding up to a US$551.6 million total for the whole year. At -46%, the company gross margins showed “significant improvement” from -82% in 2022.
“We’re already seeing positive signs in key markets like the U.S. and Indonesia,” said Thuy Le, chairperson of VinFast’s board of directors, in a statement. “Fueled by this momentum and a recovering consumer sentiment, we’re setting an ambitious target of delivering 100,000 vehicles in 2024.”
VinFast also noted its “solid foundation” in the US, Canada, and several European countries. By the end of 2024, it expects to have 130 points of sales in North America for a global total of 400.
The company’s priority for this year, however, is Asia. It got the green light to expand in Indonesia from President Joko Widodo in January and has inked deals with five local auto dealers.
VinFast also plans to begin operations in the Philippines this year, while also building a US$500 million EV manufacturing facility in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The latter’s output will be exported to South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, in addition to the domestic supply.

Southeast Asian super app Grab ended the December 2023 quarter in the black, posting US$11 million in profit for the period. This marks the first time the company logged a profitable quarter.
This is an improvement from a loss of US$391 million in Q4 2022. The company attributed this swing to an improved group adjusted EBITDA and reduced share-based compensation expenses, among other things.
With Peter Oey, Grab’s CFO, highlighting the company’s “robust balance sheet,” Grab also announced that its board has approved an up to US$500 million share repurchase plan for its class A ordinary shares.
While Grab did officially give its reasoning behind the share buyback, the move usually signals a company’s confidence that its stock would rise, at least in the short term.
Adjusted EBITDA-wise, the Singapore-based giant held on to its profitability, securing US$35 million in the quarter. It first hit the milestone in this metric during its September 2023 quarter.
“As we execute on our strategies in 2024, we expect to drive continued improvements in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow,” said Oey.
Grab’s revenue also rose 30% year on year to US$653 million for Q4 2023, which the firm attributed to growth across all its segments.
Its deliveries segment continued to be Grab’s biggest money maker, with revenue from the business growing 20% to US$321 million in Q4 last year. Mobility revenue was not far behind – it was also up 26% to US$237 million.
For the full year, revenue jumped 65% year on year to US$2.36 billion, while losses stood at US$485 million – a 72% improvement.
The super app has been under the regulatory radar for monopoly concerns. In January, the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore started a review of the proposed acquisition of Trans-Cab by Grab.
Grab was also reportedly the suitor to acquire Delivery Hero’s Foodpanda business, but the Germany-based company has ended talks of any potential sale of its Southeast Asia arm.

DCS Card Centre cardholders in Singapore were left frustrated and confused after the fintech firm made changes to repayment schedules and card annual fees.
The company – formerly Diners Club Singapore – had revised interest charges on all DCS Mastercard and UnionPay cards, as well as its Diners Club Credit Cards, in October 2023. It also revised statement repayment periods to 21 days, which means payment due dates moved ahead from the 27th of each month to the 22nd.
A cardholder who was charged late fees called the move “unfair.” The person claimed that users like themselves weren’t notified beforehand.
The person, who spoke to Tech in Asia on the condition of anonymity, also said that their numerous emails and calls to the firm went unanswered.
In response to Tech in Asia inquiries, DCS Card Centre said that it had communicated the changes to customers via SMS, its website, and customer statements between August to November 2023.
It added that the new 21-day repayment period is on par with industry standards and that it made special considerations and concessions for fee waivers during the transition period.
Heightened demand
The confusion was compounded by a lack of customer support. Dozens of people claiming to be cardholders left Google reviews saying that the firm was unresponsive to their fee waiver and card cancellation requests, despite multiple efforts to contact the company.
Of course, reviewers on Google can post without proving that they are indeed customers. However, a DCS Card Centre spokesperson acknowledged that some users had challenges in reaching its customer service team.
According to the company, its number of cardholders grew over 20% per month on average between July to December 2023, which resulted in “heightened demand” on its customer service platform. Calls to its hotline have surged by over 25% month on month since mid-2023, it said.
As of three months ago, users can actually check fee waiver requests and status updates on the DCS Cards app. However, recent requests for assistance have come from both new and existing users, the latter of which are predominantly older and less digitally connected, the spokesperson said.
“We encourage customers to utilize the DCS Cards App for seamless access to our services and to track the status of their requests,” the spokesperson added.
The company said that it is monitoring its customer service staff to ensure they respond within five to 10 working days. It is also making more agents available, as well as enhancing self-service functions on its mobile app.

The complaints come well over six months since DCS launched an ambitious plan in mid-2023 to transform itself from a card issuer into a fintech provider.
That plan involved beefing up its card offerings, introducing supply chain financing and corporate cards for SMEs, and a cards- or wallets-as-a-service offering for retailers and fintech firms. It even piloted a digital token, DUS, that’s pegged to the US dollar at a one-to-one ratio.
DCS aims to double its market share in Singapore by 2025 and break even by 2026, CEO Karen Low told Tech in Asia last August.
Since then, the firm has made notable hires, including Singapore member of parliament Tin Pei Ling as its managing director for strategic partnerships and business development. It also launched a digital innovation unit in February that plans to drive “next-generation” payment products, including in Web3.","The Singapore-based fintech firm, formerly Diners Club Singapore, saw a significant jump in the number of cardholders between July to December 2023.",Melissa Goh,Editing by Putra Muskita and Jaclyn Tiu,open,0,"",https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1692852647_Diners-Club-International.png,false,"",false,true,false,true,false,3,,575,DCS Card Centre customers lash out as fee changes spark confusion,"The Singapore-based fintech firm, formerly Diners Club Singapore, saw a significant jump in the number of cardholders between July to December 2023.",,,"","",""

UK-headquartered fintech firm Revolut more than doubled its revenue in Singapore between 2022 and 2023. This makes the company gross profitable in the city-state for the second year running.
E-money balances held in customer wallets in Singapore also increased by more than 50% year on year.
Apart from travel and remittances, Revolut now lets users trade crypto, precious metals, and stocks, while also offering budgeting tools, cashbacks, and joint savings features.
In an interview with Tech in Asia, Revolut Singapore CEO Raymond Ng said the growth was driven by the post-pandemic travel rebound. That added to the large number of expatriates and domestic workers needing remittance services – with expats making up 25% of Revolut’s users in Singapore – as well as digitally savvy users.
For now, Asia still accounts for a small percentage of Revolut’s overall revenues. The firm’s annual report from 2022 shows that Europe – including the UK – contributed 98% of Revolut’s fee income. The company earns that income from payment processing, foreign exchange fees, investments, as well as its subscription product.
In 2022, its latest available financials, Revolut reported a pre-tax loss of £25 million (US$31.5 million), even as revenues jumped 45% to £923 million (US$1.2 billion). The company had increased spending on sales and marketing, new products, and expansion into new markets.
A rising tide lifting all boats
A post-pandemic recovery in travel has been a boon for multicurrency platforms. Instarem, the cross-border payments arm of fintech firm Nium, said its revenue doubled between 2022 and 2023, while spending on its consumer travel card almost doubled.
“In 2023, we saw a 2x increase in the overall volume of remittances processed worldwide,” Yogesh Sangle, head of Instarem, told Tech in Asia. This was driven by a surge in money flows from Singapore to Asia-Pacific corridors like India and Malaysia, he added.
Last year, revenue from its SME business nearly tripled year on year.
In October 2023, YouTrip CEO and co-founder Caecilia Chu said that it had tripled its user base in the last two years. The firm was processing close to US$10 billion in annualized payment volume.
Becoming a financial super app
But despite travel’s popularity, it’s not enough to rely on it to drive app usage year-round. As Ng noted, companies like Revolut must also offer a range of financial services to maintain an active user base.
This year, the company plans to bring Revolut Business – an enterprise spend management tool already available in its other markets – to Singapore, Ng said.
Indeed, Revolut’s peers in the multicurrency digital payments space have also broadened their offerings. YouTrip, for instance, launched a corporate card and spend management platform for SMEs in 2022, while UK-based Wise supports international payments for companies via Wise Business.
Still, Revolut is not bringing over its other services just yet. For instance, credit products like personal loans – which Revolut offers in certain markets – aren’t available in Singapore yet.
Additionally, it doesn’t hold a digital banking license in the city-state, so the company plans to work with “local partners” to launch financial service products, Ng said.
At the moment, “we are not a financial super app here in Singapore – compared to the UK and Europe, but we’re trying to get there,” he said.

James Matthew Somasundram, former CEO of suspended online platform YuuZoo Corporation, has been charged over alleged misleading financial reports released by the company.
Meanwhile, Thomas Zilliacus, who was CEO and chairman of YuuZoo at the time of the alleged offenses, is also facing a warrant of arrest. He also has an Interpol red notice issued against him.
Zilliacus, who made headlines last year after he put in a bid for Manchester United, is currently out of Singapore and has refused to return, according to a police statement.
An Interpol red notice is a request to law enforcement worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest a person pending extradition, surrender, or similar legal action.
Founded in 2008, YuuZoo’s platform combined social networking, ecommerce, gaming, and online payments. It went public on the SGX mainboard in 2014, but trading of its shares has been suspended since March 2018.
In April 2018, YuuZoo said it was under investigation by Singapore’s Commercial Affairs Department for possible breaches of the Securities and Futures Act.
Apart from Zilliacus, warrants of arrest have been issued against three other individuals who were also allegedly involved in the matter but are out of Singapore and have refused to return. They are then-CFO Michael Parker, as well as Anthony Williams and Ozi Amanat, who were independent directors at the time.
Now known as YuuZoo Networks Group Corporation, the company is listed on the SGX mainboard and released quarterly financial reports under its listing obligations. Several of such reports released between 2015 and 2016 were allegedly misleading, as investigations found they overstated revenue by US$4.6 million to US$18.8 million.
Somasundram faces four charges under the Securities and Futures Act for his role in the release of these reports by YuuZoo. The statement noted that Somasundram is alleged to have been negligent in connection with the financial reports released during the period from the fourth quarter of 2015 to the third quarter of 2016.
“If convicted, he may be sentenced to imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years and/or a fine not exceeding S$250,000 (US$186,231), for each charge,” the statement said.

Hello reader,
I didn’t realize it until this weekend, but I’m a big believer in the power of positivity.
I was playing in a flag American football tournament in Bangkok, and my team didn’t start its first game well. This led to a bit of negativity from the sidelines, with some players shouting at the guys on the field who had made mistakes.
One of the captains pulled the team together and reminded everyone to keep the chatter from the sideline positive. Negativity wouldn’t help us reach our goal, so why not encourage our teammates rather than bring them down?
We turned things around from there and performed pretty well, in no small part because we started picking each other up instead of doing the opposite.
Khailee Ng is someone who also believes in the power of positivity. Today’s premium article dives into why the 500 Global partner thinks the region’s startup scene could use more optimism instead of stinking thinking.
Today we look at:

Why the tech ecosystem needs a positive mental attitude
The Singapore-based crypto news firm that’s scored funding from Franklin Templeton
Other newsy highlights such as UnoAsia’s US$32.1 million fundraise and Indonesia’s new policy requiring Google and Meta to pay for news.


Premium summary
Less jeer, more cheer

Thanks to his background as an angel investor and VC, Khailee Ng knows a thing or two about how tough it is for founders to build and scale a startup.
At the Tech in Asia Conference in Jakarta last October, Ng explained why griping and gossip-mongering within the startup community makes it even harder.


Stay positive: Ng asked attendees to avoid badmouthing or spreading rumors about companies, including those that haven’t gone public yet. He added that if the startup community was more positive and encouraging, it would let founders thrive and learn from each other more easily.

Teenage kicks: The title of Ng’s keynote speech was “Southeast Asia at the Crossroads,” and he compared the region’s tech scene to someone maturing out of their teenage years. This is a time when people learn some harsh lessons about how life really works, just as the ecosystem has endured some tough times recently regarding access to funding. He added that while teenagers follow trends, Southeast Asia’s startups shouldn’t fall into the trap of imitating other companies and find their inner voice.

Spread your wings: Ng said that for some startups, moving beyond Southeast Asia may make sense. Indonesia’s eFishery is one example, having expanded into India last year. “There are greener pastures beyond Southeast Asia for your business model. You just have to go out and find it,” he explained.

Global asset management company Franklin Templeton has invested an undisclosed amount in Blockhead, a Singapore-based crypto news platform.
The investment is the American firm’s latest move in the crypto space, having recently filed for a spot market Ether exchange-traded fund in the US.


New money meets old: Blockhead, which was established in 2022, covers the blockchain and digital asset industry, with a focus on Asia. Meanwhile, Franklin Templeton is one of the world’s largest asset managers, with some US$1.5 trillion in assets under management.

Ploughing new furrows: The new funding will be used to aid the launch of BRN, a research platform that will provide institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals with market intelligence, analysis, and insights into cryptocurrencies and digital assets.

Singapore calling: Franklin Templeton has made a couple of investments in Singapore recently, including in Transparently.AI, a regtech startup. The asset manager also launched a China-focused fund in the Lion City last year.

Prefer co-founders Jake Berber (left) and Tan Ding Jie / Photo credit: Prefer

The rise of coffee consumption comes as climate change becomes an increasingly urgent issue, with likely consequences toward its key ingredient: the coffee bean.
A 2022 report suggested that coffee beans are vulnerable to rising mean temperatures at top producers like Brazil, Indonesia, and Vietnam. By 2050, they will get drastically less suitable to farm.
That led foodtech investor Jake Berber and ASTAR scientist Tan Ding Jie to establish a coffee startup with an unconventional approach: creating ground coffee without using coffee beans.
Called Prefer, the Singapore-based startup uses fermentation methods to make “bean-free coffee.” This replicates coffee’s sensory experience, but with 10x less carbon dioxide when compared to the regular way of creating coffee.
The company has raised US$2 million in a seed round led by Forge Ventures, with participants like 500 Global, Seeds Capital, and Entrepreneur First. Another investor is the Philippine coffee chain Pickup Coffee, which will partner with Prefer to bring bean-free coffee to other parts of Southeast Asia.
Upcycling leftovers
To make bean-free coffee, Prefer ferments upcycled food – such as leftover bread, soy pulp, and spent grain like barley – to reverse-engineer coffee’s “key aroma molecules.” These are then roasted and ground before getting delivered to customers.
Of course, the base ingredients don’t naturally contain caffeine. Most of Prefer’s supply is decaffeinated – Berber said that Prefer is already the default decaf option for some of its cafe partners – but it also offers low-caffeine coffee and a caffeinated cold-brew product.
For the latter two, the company purchases caffeine powder and incorporates it into their formulation. It said that caffeine levels can be customized to a customer’s preference.
Prefer mainly supplies ground coffee that is compatible with existing espresso machines to B2B customers across 12 locations in Singapore. Its products are also available in a few outlets of the salad chain SaladStop.
While Prefer did not disclose its pricing, Berber said it looks to be a more affordable option than current arabica bean suppliers.
“Going forward, we are really excited to continue servicing B2B partners, such as hotels, food service operators, and other corporate pantries,” he added.
Looking beyond coffee – and Singapore
Prior to starting Prefer, Berber worked in the healthtech and real estate industries across the US and Israel. He then invested in foodtech startups as part of Good Seed Ventures, an Israeli VC firm. Meanwhile, Tan was a research officer for cultivated meat applications at ASTAR, the Singapore government agency for science and research, and is known to be a fermentation specialist.
While Prefer has been in the market for just three months, Berber said that the startup has logged 2x growth in sales month on month. The founders added that the company is close to breaking even and plans to remain profitable as it scales.
A game-changer will likely come through Pickup Coffee, which raised US$40 million in April 2023. Berber said that in the first half of the year, Prefer will expand across Southeast Asia, initially through a partnership with the Philippine coffee chain.
Prefer plans to use the fresh capital to increase its production capacity. Berber said that the company’s production facility will help service an anticipated increase in demand as it inks more partnerships in its home country and expands to new markets, beginning with the Philippines.
However, the founders said that Prefer intends to eventually move beyond coffee and into products like cacao, vanilla, and hazelnut. It plans to tackle one product at a time, with expansion currently slated for 2025.
“For now, we’re focusing on scaling up our coffee operations and learning as much as possible about how to do that,” Berber added.

VinFast, the Vietnam-based electric vehicle manufacturer, has announced plans to break ground on its new India facility on February 25.
The company has committed to investing US$500 million for the first phase of the integrated EV factory, spanning five years from the kickoff. Last month, it signed a memorandum of understanding with the government of Tamil Nadu, the state where the facility is located.
VinFast plans the factory to become a “first-class” EV production hub with an annual capacity of up to 150,000 units. In addition to the Indian market, EVs produced in Tamil Nadu will also be exported to countries in South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.
In a statement, VinFast said the new factory would create 3,000 to 3,500 job opportunities for local residents.
India’s EV market has grown rapidly in the last few years. According to a Bain and Company report, EVs may make up more than 40% of the country’s automotive market while generating over US$100 billion in revenue by 2030.
In addition to India, VinFast is accelerating its global expansion, having debuted its cars in Indonesia this month. The company has also met with Ferdinand Marcos Jr., the president of the Philippines, where VinFast will start operations this year.
The firm will release its earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023 later today.

Hi there,
I like pizza. Although I’m not a connoisseur, this Italian specialty is often my choice when I see it on the menu.
However, I can’t just buy pizza anytime I want. That’s because it can be quite expensive in Indonesia – at least that’s how I feel.
This is exactly what GoPizza, a South Korean startup that offers more affordable pizza and serves it faster than incumbents like Domino’s and Pizza Hut, is trying to address.
GoPizza has swiftly expanded in Asia since it started out in 2016, setting up more than 200 outlets across Indonesia, Singapore, and other markets in the region. The company is even positioning itself to go up against fast food chains with similar price points like Subway, McDonald’s, and KFC.
In this week’s Big Story, my colleague Melissa dissects GoPizza’s expansion strategy. She interviewed its CEO and founder, Jay Lim, who talked about how his company uses AI and robotics in kitchen operations.
Meanwhile, I discuss the monopoly allegations that Shopee faces in Indonesia in our Hot Take. The ecommerce firm is accused of favoring its own logistics service, Shopee Xpress, over other delivery options.

THE HOT TAKE
Shopee’s in-house logistics under fire following monopolistic allegations

Photo credit: Shopee

Here’s what happened:

Shopee is under scrutiny from the Indonesian Competition Commission (KPPU) over allegations of monopolistic practices.
The ecommerce firm is accused of automatically directing users to affiliated shipping companies – particularly its in-house logistics service, Shopee Xpress – for deliveries.
If found guilty, Shopee could face a minimum fine of 1 billion rupiah (around US$64,000). Regulators could also dock a maximum of 50% from the company’s net profits or 10% from total sales earned during the evaluation period.

Here’s our take:
After TikTok Shop’s run-in with Indonesian regulators in 2023, it’s now Shopee’s turn to be in the crosshairs of regulators.
The KPPU may find that Shopee’s actions are impeding competition because it favors its own logistics service, Shopee Xpress – now known as SPX Express.
In contrast, shoppers on Tokopedia can choose their preferred shipping company and view their respective rates. But for free shipping services, Tokopedia also restricts its delivery options to certain courier companies selected by the seller.
Shopee’s delivery process is similar to that of TikTok Shop and Lazada, which also has its own logistics unit. The platforms automatically select the delivery services, and consumers are unable to view the name of the courier company when placing an order.
But KPPU appears to be investigating only Shopee over this issue – for now, at least. This comes amid the antitrust body’s suspicions of a significant increase in the volume of shipments through the company’s own logistics arm.
In-house logistics has become the next growth area for ecommerce firms. Case in point: Shopee doubled down on expanding SPX Express since its launch in 2020.
Operating their own logistics unit allows ecommerce players to keep costs low and gives them a moat for their platforms. They also get better control over the delivery experience and can extend shipping promotions to both sellers and customers.
In Sea’s Q3 2023 earnings call, group chief corporate officer Yanjun Wang noted that the company made “strong progress” in reducing logistics costs by 17% year on year for its Asian markets during the quarter.
“We believe this to be an example of scale economics shared, where we drive down logistics costs with scale and pass the benefit of reduced shipping costs to our sellers and buyers,” Wang said.
This partiality for certain shipping companies among ecommerce firms appears to have frustrated third-party logistics (3PL) players.
J&amp;T Express, Ninja Van, Flash Express, and AnterAja all reported sluggish financial results for their regional businesses in 2022.
Without the backing of an ecommerce platform, 3PL players have to compete by offering lower shipping rates to attract consumers. The ecommerce logistics space in Indonesia is crowded with players such as J&amp;T Express, JNE, Ninja Xpress, SiCepat, AnterAja, Tiki, Lion Parcel, Rex, and ID Express.

It is possible that Shopee would be required to make changes to its shipping process, such as opening up options for courier services so that SPX Express is not automatically selected.
Shipment volume for SPX Express, however, is likely to decrease after such a move. According to a June 2023 report from Momentum Works, 35% to 40% of Shopee orders were fulfilled by its in-house logistics arm.
In addition, the company will have to compete on prices with 3PL companies on its platform and may have to spend more on promotions like free shipping.
This is not the first time that Shopee has been put under the KPPU’s microscope. In June 2023, the company decided to comply with regulator’s order to fix the partnership system of its ShopeeFood drivers after issues regarding suspension and termination were raised.

US-listed Aptar Digital Health has acquired Healint, a Singapore-based healthtech firm, for an undisclosed amount.
“This acquisition will accelerate the development of our AI-powered precision medicine SaMD, [which is] designed to augment existing treatment,” said François Cadiou, Healint’s founder and CEO, in a statement.
Following the deal, Healint’s services will be integrated into Aptar’s operations.
Founded in 2013, Healint is the company behind Migraine Buddy, a migraine tracking app it launched in 2014. The app, which helps patients understand their condition through sensor readings, has over 3 million registered users.
The firm also has another app called Clarrio, which assists users with chronic pain management.
According to Tech in Asia’s database, the company has raised US$1.2 million in disclosed funding. Backers include Wavemaker Partners, Strive, Joyful Frog Digital Incubator (JFDI.Asia), and the Singapore National Research Foundation.
Healint reported US$2.2 million in revenue for the 2023 financial year, a 33% increase from the previous year, according to data from Alternatives.pe, which monitors regulatory filings in Singapore. It recorded a positive EBIT of US$74,000 in the same period, down from US$1.3 million in FY 2022.
On Alternatives.pe, the company’s post-money valuation is listed at US$2.9 million. However, the number may not consider the full picture – such as investments from convertible debt – which would give Healint a higher valuation.
Cadiou told Tech in Asia that these financial and post-money valuation figures are “pretty wrong” but declined to comment further.
Meanwhile, Aptar provides end-to-end solutions connecting drug delivery systems, onboarding, training, and advanced data analytics services for patients. The company, which has 13,000 employees across 20 countries, says the Healint acquisition will help expand its global presence, among other things.
Aptar also plans to introduce new services like clinical trial management tools following the deal.

Delivery Hero has pulled the plug on discussions with “the main negotiating counterpart” in the sale of its Foodpanda business in select Southeast Asian markets.
In a statement, the Berlin-headquartered firm said it believed it was aligned with the potential buyer on “fundamental terms,” but it eventually withdrew from talks “as this is no longer the case.”
While Delivery Hero has not disclosed the identity of its negotiating counterpart, Grab was reportedly the suitor. Earlier this month, Delivery Hero had denied rumors that talks with Grab had fallen through.
Niklas Östberg, Delivery Hero’s co-founder and CEO, said the company sees Asia Pacific as “strongly positioned to drive profitable growth at scale.”
“The strength of our APAC business has become evident during the last quarters as the region reached an inflection point in 2023,” he said. “The decision to terminate negotiations after months of discussions was taken after careful consideration.”
Delivery Hero reported positive adjusted EBITDA of 253 million euros (US$273.9 million) for the 2023 financial year, a major reversal compared to the previous year. However, its growth hurdles in Asia remained, with its gross merchandise value down 5.8% year on year.
The company remains open to mergers and acquisitions, but it will only proceed with negotiations “where it can create value to shareholders and with high certainty of closing.”
A Foodpanda buyout would have made Grab the undisputed food delivery leader in Southeast Asia. It already has a 55% market share in the region, according to estimates from venture builder Momentum Works.

Another potential Foodpanda suitor was Meituan, but the Chinese food delivery giant confirmed that it is not making the move.

Before we dive in, here are some caveats about the data:

Publicly listed companies, decacorns, and acquired firms have been excluded from this list. 
Valuations of startups are based on data from Alternatives.pe and other publicly available sources as per the startups’ latest funding rounds. 

Over 10 years ago, Aileen Lee, a venture capitalist at Cowboy Ventures, came up with the term “unicorn” to describe a startup with a valuation of US$1 billion or more. Like the mythical creature, startups with the ability to achieve this have become more elusive.

Image credit: Timmy Loen

While a record number of 21 startups in Southeast Asia broke into this elite club in 2021, only a handful have been able to reach this valuation since then. Only eight startups achieved such status in 2022 and Indonesia-based eFishery was the only newcomer to the billion-dollar club last year.

Silicon Box, a semiconductor firm from Singapore, is the latest startup to hit unicorn status as of January 2024.
To be fair, the economic climate of 2021 was considerably different from the two years that followed. Funding has been drastically reduced to a trickle for startups.
Investment toward tech startups in Southeast Asia fell by over 65% in 2023 from a year earlier, according to Tracxn data.
The number of unicorns in the region has dwindled since we began our coverage: from 51 firms (which also included several decacorns – startups valued at U$10 billion or more), to now 38 firms, according to Tech in Asia’s analysis.

Several startups, including crypto exchange Bitkub and game developer Sky Mavis, have had their valuations trimmed. Last year, Chinese ecommerce major JD.com shut its Indonesia business, which was once considered a unicorn.
That said, some unicorns found better exit options for their investors by listing on bourses or via acquisitions. Grab, GoTo, Bukalapak, and J&amp;T Express were among the seven startups that went public, while Ovo and Bigo Live were acquired within the last five years.
Geographically, a majority of Southeast Asian unicorns are based in Singapore, followed by Indonesia, and Vietnam.

Among the investors, Sequoia and 500 Global have backed the largest number of unicorns from Southeast Asia. Following closely behind are Alpha JWC Ventures, Accel, EDB Investments, and Golden Gate Ventures.

We hope that as we constantly update our database, this will be a useful reference for anyone who’s interested in Southeast Asia’s unicorns.

Helicap, a Singapore-based alternative lending startup, has teamed up with Indonesia’s Bank Danamon to become a “one-stop solution for non-dilutive growth capital.”
In a statement, the companies said they aim to cater to the debt financing needs of nonbank firms in Indonesia, “from seed funding to IPO.” Targets include fintech businesses, alternative lenders, and MSMEs across segments like ecommerce and supply chain.
The partnership combines Helicap’s “credit expertise and resources with Danamon’s extensive reach and banking know-how,” noted David Z. Wang, Helicap’s co-founder and CEO.
Through the deal, Helicap give its borrowers access to Danamon’s range of services while driving transaction volume and customer count for the bank. Helicap will also combine its technology with the bank’s infrastructure via Danamon Cash Connect, which is focused on business banking.
The two also aim to co-lend to chosen investees.

China is moving fast with its generative AI efforts. Companies like Alibaba and Baidu have launched their alternatives to OpenAI’s ChatGPT.
Another player is Moonshot AI, whose smart chatbot Kimi Chat is built on its proprietary large language model. The company has secured over US$1 billion in funding spearheaded by Alibaba and HongShan, the Chinese spin-off of US venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, the South China Morning Post reported.
The fresh capital, which is said to be the single largest investment for a Chinese AI startup since ChatGPT’s launch, brings Moonshot AI’s valuation to US$2.5 billion.
The company was founded last year by Yang Zhilin, a computer science graduate from Tsinghua University. He previously established a sales tech company called Recurrent.ai in 2016, with the team from that startup following Yang to Moonshot AI.
It launched Kimi Chat last October. The chatbot can understand and respond to conversations that include up to 200,000 Chinese characters.

Hello reader,
“We make peace with our enemies, not our friends.” — Tyrion Lannister.
My favorite Game of Thrones character didn’t have a merger between two of Southeast Asia’s biggest tech players in mind when he uttered that line, but it still contains some pearls of wisdom for Grab and GoTo watchers.
In some aspects, joining forces makes sense for these competitors.  After all, they operate in the same sectors and would save a lot of money by not duking it out for market share.
However, there’s a big hurdle to establishing peace between opponents: One side has to lose out first, forcing it to the negotiating table.
As today’s premium story explores, neither GoTo nor Grab appears to be in a position where they desperately need a merger. We may still see these two rivals locked in battle for years to come.
Today we look at:

Why Grab and GoTo may be better off apart
Shopee’s alleged monopolistic practices in Indonesia
Other newsy highlights such as TikTok Shop still facing regulatory scrutiny in Indonesia and Wavemaker Partners approaching the close of its fifth fund

Grab and GoTo: far from a match made in heaven

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Regional tech giants Grab and GoTo are reportedly in merger talks yet again, but how realistic is it to think such a deal could be pulled off?
It’s fun to speculate on blockbuster deals, but regulatory concerns, the firms’ financial positions, and the sheer complexity of such a transaction make for long odds that a merger materializes.


Management in favor?: Recent personnel developments do boost the chances of a merger. Gojek co-founder Kevin Aluwi left GoTo’s board of commissioners last year, making him the last of Gojek’s three co-founders to exit. The new CEO, Patrick Walujo, has not shied away from decisive moves to improve GoTo’s prospects.. GoTo gave up its controlling stake in Tokopedia as part of its merger with TikTok Shop, indicating that Walujo can make bold decisions and leave sentimentality off the table.

Lack of urgency:  Grab and Gojek’s respective cash positions improved in the third quarter of 2023, so neither may be in a rush to complete a deal. Both recorded quarters with positive adjusted EBITDA – Grab in Q3 2023 and GoTo in the fourth quarter of the same year. Nailul Huda, director of digital economy at the Center of Economic and Law Studies, believes that a merger between the two players “will not happen in the next one or two years” due to their cash positions.

Regulatory minefield: Given that both firms are market leaders across Southeast Asia, getting the green light from competition watchdogs would be tough. The merged entity would dominate ride-sharing in Indonesia as well as the food delivery market. The Indonesian Competition Commission (KPPU) already warned that a merger could lead to monopolistic practices in certain sectors. Grab is already under review by the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore for its acquisition of taxi company Trans-cab. A GoTo-Grab merger would surely attract even more scrutiny in the city-state,

News spotlight
A Shopee monopoly?

Image credit: Timmy Loen

An Indonesian watchdog is investigating Shopee for alleged monopolistic practices in the country.
The ecommerce player has been accused of automatically directing users to affiliated shipping firms for deliveries, particularly its in-house logistics service, Shopee Xpress.


The problem is choice: Such a move stops consumers from “choosing courier services from other companies at desired prices,” KPPU spokesperson Deswin Nur told Tech in Asia.” He added that this significantly boosted shipping volumes for Shopee Xpress and other affiliates.

Feeling fine?: If the allegations are upheld, Shopee could be slapped with a minimum fine of around US$64,000. A maximum of 50% of the company’s net profits or 10% of its total sales earned could also be docked during the period of the violation.

House rules: Shopee Xpress launched in 2020 and had more than 300 hubs across Southeast Asia as of February 2023. Shopee’s regional ecommerce peers Lazada and Tokopedia also have their own in-house logistics services.

The fresh funds came courtesy of Korean automotive manufacturer HL Mando and Beacon Venture Capital, the corporate VC unit of Thailand’s Kasikornbank. Alodokter declined to disclose its valuation, though Alternatives.pe pegs it at US$136.1 million.
The healthtech startup plans to further develop its digital healthcare ecosystem for its 25 million monthly active users, it said.
Founded in 2014 by Nathanael Faibis and Suci Arumsari, Alodokter offers an array of healthcare services, including online doctor consultations, in-person appointment booking, and informative articles on health.
Its investors include SoftBank Ventures Asia, Golden Gate Ventures, and Sequis Life.
Last year, Alodokter acquired pregnancy-tracking app Diary Bunda from Japan-based Marubeni Corporation for an undisclosed sum.
Alodokter had also launched Alni, a chat-based virtual assistant tailored for physicians. Alni employs conversational AI to help telemedicine practitioners pre-assess patients, among other things.

Atome CEO David Chen / Photo credit: Atome

Continuing a recent string of management shakeups in Southeast Asia’s startup scene, Atome CEO David Chen has stepped down from the company. Chen will join GoTo Financial, the fintech arm of Indonesia’s GoTo Group, as head of consumer lending.
Chen will remain as co-founder of Advance Intelligence Group, the buy now, pay later (BNPL) service’s parent firm, a company spokesperson confirmed.
Before leading Atome in 2018, Chen founded and led Nestia, a consumer lifestyle app. He also held research and engineering roles at companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Yahoo in the mid- to late 2000s.
His departure from Atome adds to the list of CEO and co-founder exits announced this year, which includes companies like Carousell, Modalku, and 17Live.
Through GoTo Financial, GoTo offers services like digital wallet GoPay and BNPL product GoPay Later.
While GoPay was previously bundled in the Gojek app, a standalone app was launched for the e-wallet in August 2023. More recently, GoTo Financial teamed up with its affiliate Bank Jago to introduce GoPay Tabungan by Jago, a bank account for daily transactions that is accessible through the GoPay and Gojek apps.
Meanwhile, Atome is present in five countries across Southeast Asia. Its parent Advance Intelligence Group is valued at roughly US$2 billion, according to Tech in Asia data.
Backers include SoftBank’s Vision Fund, Warburg Pincus, and EDBI.
However, Atome in July last year confirmed its exit from the Vietnam market to Tech in Asia, saying that “Vietnam’s contribution to our overall business was limited.”

Zhang Ying, spouse of Alibaba Group co-founder Jack Ma, has purchased three shophouses on Duxton Road in Singapore, The Business Times reported.
A Singapore citizen, Zhang bought units at 70, 71, and 72 Duxton Road, a neighborhood close to Singapore’s Chinatown district.
The shophouses cover a land area of 3,239 square feet and are currently being refurbished, which includes a lift installation. Singapore’s Urban Redevelopment Authority has approved the renovation, which will convert the ground floor for restaurant use and the upper floors into office space.
The transaction amount is reported to be between S$45 million and S$50 million (US$33.5 million to US$43.9 million). This pricing is above the usual market rate for conservation shophouses in the area, The Business Times highlighted, which typically do not surpass US$3,000 per square foot.
In 2019, Ma reportedly planned to build a two-story bungalow at Victoria Park Close in Singapore at an unknown price. It’s unclear whether the plans have come into fruition.
In the same year, James Sheng, another Alibaba co-founder, had also purchased a US$37.2 million dollar property in Leedon Park after becoming a Singapore citizen.

Indonesia has introduced a new presidential decree that will require digital platforms like Meta and Google to pay news publishers in exchange for distributing their content. The new law will go into effect six months after yesterday’s signing by outgoing president Joko Widodo (Jokowi).
Dubbed the Publisher Rights decree, it stipulates that digital platforms are responsible for maintaining a healthy news publishing business. Among the ways they can do so include designing a news distribution algorithm that supports quality journalism as well as partnering with news publishers.
These partnerships may comprise a paid licensing arrangement, profit sharing, data sharing, or any other agreed type.
In an event celebrating Indonesia’s national press day, Jokowi noted that the Publisher Rights decree was initiated by media firms themselves, not the government.
“We want journalism that is high quality, journalism that is far from negative content, journalism that educate for Indonesia’s development,” he said.
In a statement quoted by CNBC Indonesia, Google touted the importance of access to “diverse news sources” as well as an ecosystem that would help both big and small publishers to develop.
Over the years, Google and Facebook have become important distribution channels for news. However, this has led to plummeting advertising revenue for publishers.
Indonesia’s new decree follows those already implemented in Australia and Canada, with several other countries likely to follow suit.","A new presidential decree stipulates digital platforms to “partner” with news publishers, which may include licensing fees or profit and data sharing.",Putra Muskita,Editing by Lorenzo Kyle Subido,open,0,"",https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1694664543_shutterstock_552493561.jpg,false,"",false,true,false,true,false,2,,229,"Indonesia to require Google, Meta to compensate news publishers","A new presidential decree stipulates digital platforms to “partner” with news publishers, which may include licensing fees or profit and data sharing.",,,"","",""

Increasing uses for what the industry calls insect biomaterials are pushing players to shift focus or explore other markets, especially as some have been frustrated by the lack of development in the insects-for-food space here.

Black soldier fly farm / Photo credit: Insectta

One of the early movers in the insect space is Insectta. The company started in 2018 as a black soldier fly farm in Singapore that made animal feed and fertilizer.
It had two pain points then, co-founder and chief marketing officer Chua Kai-Ning told The Business Times.
First, farm operations do not play into Singapore’s strengths in research and development (R&amp;D).
Second, the industry for feed and fertilizer is limited in its potential. Cow and sheep farmers can produce high-value products, such as leather and wool, but black soldier flies do not have similar yields.
These challenges led the company to pivot away from farming and into the production of biomaterials – materials derived from biological organisms – in 2019.
The company produces chitosan and melanin from black soldier fly cocoon shells, which they source from fly farms across Southeast Asia. It raised an undisclosed amount in a seed round in 2020 and opened its pilot facility in November 2023.
Chitosan is used in a wide range of products, including disinfectants, cholesterol supplements, and antifungal creams. Melanin could potentially be used in bone regeneration scaffolds to help cells proliferate as well as in energy storage devices to power electronics.
While Insectta is not yet generating revenue, Chua said the company is trying to build its customer base in the fields of healthcare, electronics, and cosmetics.
It also hopes to scale up operations by next year to process up to 600 kilograms of cocoon shells. Its current capacity stands at 5 kilograms, from which it can extract 300 to 500 grams of chitosan and 50 grams of melanin.
Another insect company is Malaysia-based Nutrition Technologies, which produces animal feed and fertilizer from black soldier fly larvae and feces in its production facility in Johor.
Black soldier flies have very active immune systems, as they produce a lot of antimicrobial peptides, said the company’s chief technology officer Martin Zorrilla. Products derived from these flies are therefore beneficial to animal and plant health.
The company exports its insect protein and oil products globally, with Asia and Europe as its largest markets. Demand from Asia’s aquaculture industry is high, while demand in Europe comes largely from the pet food industry, said Zorrilla.
Nutrition Technologies has an office in Singapore for R&amp;D. It is also looking to build larger facilities in Malaysia and expand into other Southeast Asian countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It raised US$20 million in its latest funding round in 2022.
Avoiding a bind
By producing biomaterials instead of food, Insectta and Nutrition Technologies have avoided an issue that has hurt a number of insect-related startups here.
Several years ago, the industry was swept up by the possibility that cricket flours and stir-fried silkworms would offer a solution to global food shortages.
Enterprise Singapore estimates that from 2019 to 2022, roughly US$40 million was invested in insect companies in the region. There were at least 11 insect-related businesses with operations in Singapore in 2022, the latest year for which the agency has data.
The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) said last April that 16 species of insects, including crickets and silkworms, would be approved for consumption in the second half of 2023.
That deadline was missed. Two companies in the sector told BT they are venturing into other markets while they await approval.
Asia Insect Farm Solutions (AIFS), which produces cricket snacks, is looking to do market tests in South Korea, said its co-founder, Yuvanesh TS. AIFS is currently bootstrapped.
“Truth be told, I already have plans of closing down AIFS,” he said. “It’s been a long time since we started (in 2017), but there hasn’t been much activity around the sector.”
He said his decision will depend on approval in Singapore as well as how well the South Korean market test goes.

Altimate Nutrition, a company making cricket protein bars and powder, has obtained on-paper approval to sell its products in the UK, said co-founder Gavriel Tan. He expects to roll out the products by March or April.
In Singapore, the company earns revenue from conducting insect-focused workshops. It has also reached out to restaurants to explore future partnerships.
Altimate Nutrition is also bootstrapped but is looking to raise funds in the UK.
Tan said the number of companies making insect food products for human consumption here has gradually decreased over the years.
“There are not many players because we are operating with such uncertainty,” he said. “Another risk is that we are not sure whether there’s a product-market fit or whether people in Singapore will be open to eating insects.”
Tan Han Kiat, senior director of licensing at SFA, said in a statement on January 29 that the agency needed more time to establish regulations for the safety of insects as food and that it aims to introduce the regulatory framework in the first half of this year.
Investors have not given up hope on the sector, but they are picking their battles.
Tan Kaixin, general manager at Seeds Capital, said that “the insect sector is relatively small in scale and niche; but it has opportunities given the need for alternatives that are not only sustainable but are ideal for land and resource-scarce Singapore.”
Keith Loo, deal flow manager of venture capital firm Trendlines, said the low value of insect feed and food products does not match the high operating costs in Singapore. “A lot of times, companies are unable to hit profitability because the final product is cheap.”
Trendlines has invested in Insectta, as the firm’s products can be used in healthcare and biomedical devices, which increases their value.
Hian Goh, co-founder and general partner of Openspace Ventures, said he expects adoption of alternative protein for human consumption to be slow.
Openspace is a backer of Nutrition Technologies, which Goh believes has the potential to “generate very large amounts of business and export globally.”
Amid the challenges of making insect-derived food for human consumption, Altimate Nutrition’s Tan still sees many opportunities in the sector.
“We don’t plan to sell just food; we plan to expand to other areas (in the future) like insects for its medicinal properties.”

Franklin Templeton is furthering its reach in the crypto space. After recently filing for a spot market Ether exchange-traded fund in the US, the trillion-dollar global asset management company has invested an undisclosed amount in Blockhead, a Singapore-based crypto news firm.
Established in 2022, Blockhead is known for its coverage of the blockchain and digital asset industry, particularly in Asia.
“This investment is part of our efforts to foster a global ecosystem of digital asset operators that can capitalize on the multitude of benefits that blockchain technology offers,” Kevin Farrelly, director of digital asset management at Franklin Templeton, said in a statement.
The investment will support the launch of BRN, Blockhead’s new research platform, among other initiatives.
Designed for institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals, BRN will offer exclusive market intelligence, data-driven analysis, and insights into the cryptocurrencies and digital assets.
BRN will also delve into key tokens, emerging industry trends, and the broader macroeconomic forces shaping the digital asset landscape.
Franklin Templeton also recently invested in Transparently.AI, a regtech startup based in Singapore. The US-headquartered firm also launched a new China-focused fund in the city-state, aiming to primarily invest in China A-shares and mainland Chinese companies listed on the local bourse for long-term capital appreciation.

Uno Digital Bank CEO Manish Bhai / Photo credit: Uno Digital Bank

Singapore-based UnoAsia, the parent company of Uno Digital Bank in the Philippines, has raised US$32.1 million in a pre-series B round.
The fundraise, which was a mix of debt and equity, saw participation from Gateway Partners, Creador Private Equity, and Nextinfinity Management. Overall, UnoAsia has raised nearly US$75 million so far.
With its latest raise now completed, Uno Digital Bank has made profitability its priority for 2024, its CEO Manish Bhai told Tech in Asia.
The company said that it will continue to scale up its current product line while adding more offerings in the coming months.
Profitability at the forefront
UnoAsia was founded by Bhai and Kalidas Ghose in 2020, but Uno Digital Bank only became commercially operational about 15 months ago. Uno Digital Bank currently offers services such as savings, transactions, investment products, and insurance.
To fuel its growth, the company aims to meet the needs of the Philippines’ growing bankable population, which is expected to hit 85 million by 2030, a 30% increase from 2022.
Part of these efforts is its rollout of consumer durable loans, which are personal loans for retail and ecommerce purchases. The bank plans to launch the product within the next month or two.
Uno Digital Bank introduced personal loans in the last quarter of 2023, but Bhai said the segment has already seen a strong uptick. Loans currently account for most of the company’s revenue.
“On a steady stage, we expect 60 to 70% of revenue to come from loans and the rest to come from payments and insurance,” the CEO added.
The bank is currently operating at a single-digit non-performing loan (NPL) ratio. For perspective, BDO Unibank, one of the largest banks in the Philippines in terms of assets and one of the oldest in Southeast Asia, had an NPL ratio of 2.8% in 2021.
Uno Digital Bank also plans to add life, health, and other general insurance products to its offerings in the coming months.
Eyeing MSMEs
The bank said that it currently has 1 million customers, who account for US$100 million in deposits. It expects to more than double its user base by the end of 2024.
As part of its growth efforts, Uno Digital Bank is aiming to introduce new products tailored to MSMEs in the latter half of the year. Currently, MSMEs make up only 10% of the company’s user base, with the rest being retail consumers.
“Within the next two or three years, we want to have a kind of a 60 to 40 [ratio] between individual customers and MSMEs,” said Bhai.
In 2020, MSMEs contributed around 40% to the Philippines’ gross domestic product. They also accounted for about 63% of the country’s employment.

Hello reader,
I’ve always found this idea that governments usually have a “monopoly on violence” really interesting. The word “monopoly” tends to be used within business contexts, but in this case it refers to how governments are typically the only legitimate wielder of violence in a country, which manifests through law enforcement.
It speaks to how many aspects of our daily lives and experiences are gated behind a government’s control. Violence, after all, is something that every person is capable of. Sometimes we feel inclined to it, but in some cases the only thing stopping those extreme emotions from boiling over is the deterrence of the punishment that would follow suit.
In a similar vein, one of the ways that government control manifests is through licenses. After the government decides what is and isn’t permissible, licenses serve as a stamp of approval for the public and companies to continue with certain operations.
In Malaysia, there’s one particular license that used-car marketplaces Carsome and MyTukar – the local unit of Carro – are vying for. Let’s take a look at their chances of winning it.
Today we look at:


A license with huge potential for Carsome and Carro
Singapore’s plan to invest US$742 million into AI development
Other newsy highlights such as VinFast’s new deals in Indonesia and Masayoshi Son eyeing a US$100 billion raise for an AI chip venture.

License to… inspect?

Image credit: Timmy Loen

The license involves the inspection of commercial vehicles and the transfer of vehicle ownership from one person or company to another. This could give Carsome and Carro more revenue opportunities, but the process of getting it may not be as straightforward as some might think.


Winner takes all: Currently, Malaysian law stipulates that all commercial vehicles need to be inspected by Puspakom, the incumbent license holder. The government has tried to progressively phase out its monopoly, but efforts have been slow-moving since 2018.

Others on the starting line: Carsome and Carro will face tough competition for the license. Other companies going for it include the likes of government-linked corporation Sime Darby and family-run conglomerates Berjaya and Naza. 

Beyond the money: While getting an additional revenue channel is a huge factor, the license could benefit both firms in other ways. This includes building credibility and opening up opportunities to work closer with the government and state-owned investors.

Eggs in the AI basket

With all the hullabaloo around AI, even governments are moving relatively quickly to try and capture some of the zeitgeist.
One of them is Singapore, which recently revealed that it would be pumping US$742 million into the sector over the next five years. As a citizen, I’m definitely happy we’re not sluggish about capitalizing on important developments.


Dishing out the budget: The initiative was announced by Lawrence Wong, Singapore’s deputy prime minister and minister for finance, during his 2024 budget speech.

All according to keikaku (that’s “plan” in Japanese): The city-state intends to use the investment to boost its local AI talent pool, secure access to chips crucial for AI tasks, and partner with leading companies to build AI centers. 

Can’t stop won’t stop: The investment builds on top of Singapore’s National AI Strategy, which involves bringing in top overseas talent for advanced research and practical applications, among other initiatives.

Hello,
Recently, I went shopping with someone for a mutual friend’s wedding. We stumbled upon a bike shop, which brought back memories of biking to school. We loved cycling!
We almost bought bikes right then before we realized: “Where are we going to use them?”
We couldn’t think of a single place where we could go by cycling without worrying about someone stealing them. It’s hard enough to find safe parking spaces for cars and motorcycles in most Indian cities, let alone bikes.
The problem of theft – along with other major issues – led Ofo, one of the bike-sharing platforms in India, to exit the country, which caused major layoffs.
But in Singapore, Anywheel, which started during the same time as Ofo but on a much smaller scale, has not only survived but thrived.
In this week’s first Big Story, my colleague Putra writes about how Anywheel has become the city’s largest bike-sharing platform.
In our second Big Story, my colleague Emmanuel writes about another small player who has made it big. Jason Chin, a solo entrepreneur based out of Singapore, is halfway to earning US$1 million just by selling Notion templates.
And for this week’s AI Odyssey, I write about OpenAI’s latest text-to-video offering – Sora – and the potential concerns around it.

THE BIG STORIES
1️⃣Anywheel defies odds to survive Singapore’s bike-sharing wars

Anywheel was around as a relatively small player during bike-sharing’s heyday in Singapore. Now, it’s still standing – despite a lack of VC funds.
2️⃣This 22-year-old turns Notion templates into a thriving business

What started out as a hobby has given Easlo, also known as Jason Chin, a six-figure annual income. Chin is part of the no-code wave, where users build and launch software without learning any coding.

AI ODYSSEY
Promising AI projects we’re noticing60 seconds to trouble: what Sora means for short-form videos
Initially hailed as a great innovation, single-use products have become the largest contributor to the global waste crisis. Likewise, I believe generative AI is going to be remembered as the largest contributor of digital trash.
According to a recent report by AWS researchers, more than half of the content on the internet is machine-generated. Another report says that 90% of digital content will be AI-generated by 2026.
The impact can already be felt. Captions, comments, resumes, Tinder profiles – everything has the same generic vibe these days thanks to these large language models.
If that wasn’t enough, last Thursday, OpenAI went a step further and launched Sora, a text-to-video model.

Image credit: Timmy Loen

If you’re thinking Sora is just another addition to models like Runway ML, it isn’t. Sora is a powerful diffusion model that uses the recaptioning technique (when an AI model rewrites a basic text prompt to be more descriptive, improving the quality of the final output) from OpenAI’s DALL·E 3.
The model can generate and edit a video after being given simple written prompts. It can even create a video from an image input.
In simpler words, Sora is legit. It creates almost believable video content. In the words of a Reddit user, “My mind knows this is fake, my eyes know its fake, yet I still can’t fully accept that this is fake.” Here’s a video of wooly mammoths to prove it.
We know what you’re thinking: No, it won’t create a full movie if you prompt it with a whole novel. Currently, it only generates videos of up to one minute, like this one.
But that’s where the issue lies. Content makers have garnered millions of followers thanks to 30- to 60-second videos shared on platforms like TikTok and Instagram. Like what happened to written content in 2023, it’s only a matter of time before we see a surge in AI-generated video content.
And that’s not even the scariest issue. Governments globally are grappling with election-related issues involving deepfakes. There is also a rise in AI-powered apps that generate porn from innocent pictures of teenagers.
With OpenAI’s new offering, there is no limit to what can be done if someone wants to manipulate media. Remember last year’s news of the Pentagon blast, which actually emerged from fake images generated by AI?
That news briefly affected the stock market. Now imagine the same scenario with videos.
While OpenAI says it’s creating a detection classifier that can distinguish videos generated by Sora, among other things, the head of the DALL·E team told Wired that distinguishing between real and fake content will “need understanding from society and for social media networks to adapt.”

837734,2024-02-20T06:00:02,2024-02-21T03:32:10,South Korean startup serves pizza with AI and robotics. But is it a flash in the pan?,south-korean-startup-serves-pizza-ai-robotics-flash-pan,publish,post,https://www.techinasia.com/south-korean-startup-serves-pizza-ai-robotics-flash-pan,"GoPizza CEO and founder Jay Lim is no foodie, but he is on a mission to make pizza more accessible.
Lim, who attended university in Singapore, recalls paying S$20 to S$30 (US$15 to US$22) for a buy one, get one free pizza, which he found “illogical.” Apart from waiting over an hour for your order to be delivered, “you’re sure to have leftovers,” he says.

Now, he owns the third-largest pizza chain in Singapore by store count. Demand for its pizzas are driven by trends including an increase in single-person households, rising cost of living, and a post-pandemic labor crunch, Lim tells Tech in Asia.
GoPizza started out in South Korea as a single food truck in 2016. Eight years later, it has 200 stores in seven markets in Asia and plans to add another 100 by June.
In December 2023 alone, GoPizza opened six new stores in Singapore.

The company, which Lim says has raised US$50 million from investors to date, sold more than US$37 million worth of pizza at its outlets and at franchise stores in 2023.
GoPizza is also backed by some of South Korea’s biggest conglomerates. GS Venture is the corporate venture arm of GS Group, which owns around 17,000 GS25 convenience stores in the country as of June 2023. CJ Investment, whose parent firm CJ Group is a leading distributor and manufacturer of beverages and frozen food, is also an investor.
Lim shares that GoPizza’s valuation is an estimated US$150 million while its revenue hit US$20 million in 2023, after accounting for franchise sales.
Making pizzas efficiently
Rectangular in shape and at about 27 cm long and 17 cm wide (roughly 11 inches by 7 inches), GoPizzas are the “perfect size” for an individual portion, Lim says. They’re also slightly heftier than a 7-inch personal pizza from Domino’s.
In Singapore, GoPizza’s prices range from S$7 (US$5.20) for a standard pizza to S$12 (US$9) for one with premium toppings. It could take between five to seven minutes on average to serve the pizzas, making them suitable for takeaways.
That’s slightly cheaper than what Domino’s charges for its personal pizza, which is priced between S$12.90 to S$15.90 (US$9.60 to US$11.80). Pizza Hut’s personal pan pizzas, meanwhile, cost between S$12.10 to S$16.65 (US$9 to US$12.40) and are smaller at 6-inches wide.
However, GoPizza doesn’t see chains like Pizza Hut and Domino’s as its main rivals in Singapore. Instead, it competes against fast food giants that offer a similar price point and value such as Subway, McDonald’s, and KFC, Lim says.

GoPizza uses patented ovens designed to bake its pizzas in under five minutes – half the time that it would normally take on conventional ovens.
A specially formulated “par-baked” or partially baked dough eliminates the need for any kneading. Robots sprinkle condiments and drizzle sauces with precision, leaving humans to do the unexacting tasks of topping the pizzas and placing them in the oven.
The company also taps AI to monitor the topping process, ensuring that ingredients are placed accurately and consistently. It also uses facial recognition tech to help supervise stores and to identify if any of its employees are incorrectly making a pizza.
How does this process affect the taste of GoPizza’s products? Its pizzas are certainly not designed to match those kneaded by a skilled human or baked in wood-fired ovens. Artisanal pizza is “not where we are – that’s not our market,” Lim says.
Scaling in a hypercompetitive market
Countless F&amp;B tech players including a glut of coffee-tech players have flocked to Singapore, hoping to make a dent in the world’s most expensive city.
Jianggan Li, founder and CEO of venture builder Momentum Works, notes that operating in highly competitive markets despite their higher costs makes sense because of existing consumer demand.
He believes there is “a lot of room” to apply tech innovations in other fast food categories, particularly grab-and-go concepts. As such, he expects competition in GoPizza’s category to intensify as more operators turn to tech to differentiate themselves or streamline their operations.
Competing value-for-money chains like EatPizza, which is also based in South Korea, have sprung up, selling pizzas that are similar in price, shape, and size.

EatPizza, which has over 100 stores in its home market, made a buzz in Singapore when it opened its first store in January.
The company shares several similarities with its rival: EatPizza also offers flavors ranging from classic to Korean style, and it has a baking process that can serve up pizzas for one in under five minutes.
As far as F&amp;B tech firms go, however, China-headquartered Luckin Coffee is a standout for Momentum Works’ Li. The coffee chain uses tech in everything, from its ordering system and payments process to product development and user acquisition and retention.

In comparison, GoPizza uses tech mostly to optimize its operations, so there’s room to apply it in areas like loyalty programs or to provide personalized menu recommendations based on a customer’s order history.
Given the growing competition and similar offerings from other players, can GoPizza build a sustainable business in Singapore?
Lim says he’s confident not just in GoPizza’s position in the city-state but also in its product – the dough mixture and the manufacturing process it has refined over years of R&amp;D.
He pointed out that “it’s very difficult to have that superior and consistent quality with low production costs” when mass producing dough, but GoPizza has achieved that.
As fast as Flash Coffee?
GoPizza’s blistering pace of store openings brings to mind Flash Coffee, the chain that filed for a voluntary winding up in Singapore and shut down its 11 stores in the city-state in October 2023 to focus on its “most promising markets.”
In 2021, Flash Coffee was opening three stores a week in Asia Pacific, with plans to triple that rate to achieve its target of opening 300 outlets that same year.
Flash Coffee’s speedy expansion, however, was just one of the many reasons for its eventual retreat from Singapore.
An analysis from Momentum Works attributed Flash Coffee’s exit to its inadequate use of tech to differentiate itself from competitors as well as the lack of a well-defined value proposition and F&amp;B experience among its founding members.

While Lim has no F&amp;B background, he does not see it as a hindrance. Instead, he says this helped him come up with “random ideas” to solve problems such as how to pre-make dough or bake pizzas faster.
“If I were a chef, I would have [thought] that it wasn’t possible,” he adds.
Breaking even in six months
With the technology it has developed, GoPizza outlets can operate at a fraction of the real estate footprint as well as labor and rental costs of larger stores, Lim says.
In Singapore and South Korea, many of GoPizza’s shops are situated within convenience stores, petrol stations, and cinemas. They’re also compact at 50 square feet – just slightly larger than the size of a king-sized bed – and manned by two employees.

With its “shop in shop” strategy, the company “can immediately absorb their traffic,” reducing investment costs and operating expenses, Lim explains.
According to the CEO, close to 40% of GoPizza’s 26 stores in Singapore broke even on an EBITDA basis in their first six months of operations.
A franchise store located in a regional mall in Singapore, for instance, makes S$5,000 to S$6,000 (US$3,700 to (US$4,400) in sales a day – a feat made possible by its high degree of automation, Lim says.
GoPizza also operates bigger outlets, with store sizes averaging 200 square feet and 500 square feet in Singapore and South Korea, respectively. In markets like India, where labor and rental are relatively more affordable, GoPizza has more spacious stores.
Enough runway for “at least three years”
By the second quarter of this year, GoPizza plans to set up a hundred more 50 square feet stores in convenience stores across South Korea via a partnership.
Lim declined to share the name of its partner or where those stores would be located before the official announcement. But he attributed GoPizza’s ability to launch so many stores in one go because of their compact size.
He expects the company to become EBITDA positive from this year, stressing that the firm is “funded enough” – it has enough runway “for at least three years.”
A “huge upgrade” in its dough this year will make its pizzas more suitable for deliveries and takeaways, the CEO shares.
The goal, he tells Tech in Asia, is to build a pizza company that would be recognized anywhere in the world, including the US.
“We do want to go to the US, but up until last year, we felt we were not ready,” Lim says. “But now that we’re gearing up for profitability and all the countries are stabilized … maybe it’s time.”

Singapore-based fintech firm Xalts has acquired Contour Network, a trade finance solutions provider owned by a clutch of global banks including HSBC, Standard Chartered, Citi, and BNP Paribas.
Carl Wegner, CEO of Contour Network, will join Xalts’ senior leadership team following the acquisition, but his exact position was undisclosed. Xalts added that its initial focus after the deal is to provide embedded solutions for trade and supply chain finance, particularly for banks, logistics firms, and tech companies.
Contour Network started as a pilot project in 2017, connecting corporations to their banking and trade ecosystem partners through its platform. It has since grown to have over 22 banks and more than 100 global businesses as clients, including Tata Group and Rio Tinto.
The acquisition by Xalts may come as a surprise, as it is usually bank-owned entities making startup buyouts.
Xalts, which is backed by Accel and Citi Ventures, is a financial infrastructure builder that is used by institutions to create multi-party apps for digitalization and tokenization. It was founded in 2022 by Ashutosh Goel and Supreet Kaur, former senior executives at HSBC and Meta, respectively.
The company currently has a team of over 50 across offices in Singapore, Hong Kong, India, the United Arab Emirates, and the UK.

TikTok Shop is still facing regulatory scrutiny in Indonesia, even after resuming its operations in December last year through a partnership with Tokopedia.
Teten Masduki, the country’s minister of cooperatives and SMEs, said that TikTok Shop continues to violate local regulations because the platform still allows direct transactions on social media.
“While TikTok is investing in Tokopedia, on the other hand, it is still violating rules,” said Masduki, as reported by CNBC Indonesia.
“We do not have an issue with the investment, but we do have an issue with TikTok Shop, which, in practice, is still integrated with social media,” he added.
Although Tokopedia now handles transactions on TikTok Shop in Indonesia, users can still make direct purchases through the latter’s platform, similar to before its temporary closure in October 2023.
Last month, TikTok completed a deal to acquire a 75% stake in Tokopedia valued at US$2.2 billion, according to GoTo’s latest public disclosure. This partnership allowed TikTok Shop to resume its operations in the country after the temporary closure.
Tech in Asia has reached out to TikTok Indonesia for comments.
In December 2023, Trade Minister Zulkifli Hasan said he would monitor the partnership between TikTok Shop and Tokopedia for the next four months. After that period, his ministry will audit whether any violations still occur.
Masduki will coordinate with Hasan to discuss the issue. He also previously suggested that Hasan revise ecommerce regulations by adding points related to price competition and predatory pricing.

Over a year since unveiling its plan to raise US$5 million, PriyoShop, a B2B retail platform for MSMEs in Bangladesh, has finally reached the target.
It raised the amount in a pre-series A funding round led by Century Oak Ventures. Other investors like Evolution Ventures, Iterative, and Orbit Startups also joined the fundraising, according to a statement.
Founded in mid-2021, PriyoShop helps MSMEs source products at competitive prices and with quick deliveries. The startup – which won Tech in Asia’s first virtual Pitch Night in 2020 – also provides financial services for small businesses, among other services.
Asikul Alam Khan, PriyoShop’s founder and CEO, shared that the fresh capital would boost the firm’s tech infrastructure and help it augment its user base through the introduction of new financial services.
PriyoShop collaborates with over 200 brands, including PepsiCo and Coca-Cola, to upgrade their operations and provide them with a more efficient digital supply chain management system.
Khan added that while PriyoShop currently has around 55,000 merchants on the platform, it aims to “positively impact over one million merchants in the coming year.”
The company said it is tapping into the vast market of small local stores, where the majority of retail transactions – roughly 97% of Bangladesh’s US$200 billion annual sales – take place.

Wavemaker Partners, a VC firm focusing on early-stage investments in Southeast Asia, is nearing its target of US$150 million for its fifth fund, sources told Tech in Asia.
The firm has reportedly secured commitments of around US$100 million so far, and it intends to raise the remaining US$50 million within the next couple of quarters. The total amount exceeds that of Wavemaker’s Fund 4, which the VC firm closed in March 2022 at US$136 million.
Fund 5 has attracted a mix of returning and new limited partners (LPs), the sources added.
Long-standing Wavemaker LPs, including Temasek, the International Finance Corporation, and Pavilion Capital, have returned for the new fund. Additionally, new partners such as DEG and Siguler Guff have joined, further broadening the firm’s investor base, according to the sources.
The sources said Wavemaker continues to see “interesting deal flow” in the enterprise, deeptech, and sustainability sectors – areas where it has over a decade of experience.
They added that Wavemaker has started investing from the new fund, including deals such as Meiro, Vama, and Zuno Carbon.
Since its establishment in Southeast Asia in 2012, Wavemaker has backed more than 190 companies across Southeast Asia, including agritech startup eFishery, Indonesia’s newest unicorn; B2B ecommerce platform Growsari in the Philippines; and anti-financial crime AI company Silent Eight based in Singapore.
It recently launched Wavemaker Impact, a climate tech venture builder, which closed its own fund in December 2023 at US$60 million.

In the fast-paced world of finance, where numbers hold the key to success, Singapore-based regtech firm Transparently.AI is using AI to help companies fight against accounting manipulation and fraud.
The company recently secured an undisclosed investment from Franklin Templeton, a global investment firm with roughly US$1.4 trillion in assets under management, as part of its admission to the asset manager’s FinTech Incubator program.
The investment is part of a US$3 million pre-series A funding round that brought Transparently.AI’s valuation to around US$20 million, the company said.
“We are already putting the money to work by investing in sales and marketing, to establish our customer base in Singapore, Hong Kong and Australia,” Transparently.AI CEO Hamish Macalister told Tech in Asia.
The incubator program, meanwhile, will give it access to mentorship and guidance from Franklin Templeton’s network of startup professionals, as well as access to the program’s offices in Singapore and California.
Founded in 2021, Transparently.AI provides an AI-based solution to scan corporate balance sheets for potential manipulation and fraud.
Previously, the company raised US$1 million in seed funding, with Move Asset Management acting as the lead investor for that round.

Waresix has laid off employees from its data and engineering team, people with direct knowledge of the matter told Tech in Asia.
The Indonesia-based logistics firm announced the layoffs during a town hall held on February 16, according to one of the sources. This was corroborated by an email sent to staff after the meeting, in which Waresix said it is “streamlining the product and engineering department.”
“The leadership made this tough decision with careful consideration and caution,” the email reads. The company added that it will fully honor the rights and benefits of those affected.
The exact number of retrenched staff is unconfirmed. Tech in Asia sought comment from Waresix, but the company has not replied.
Founded in 2017 by Andree Susanto and Edwin Wibowo, the company offers end-to-end logistics services including trucking, warehousing, multimodal transport, and vendor management.
In 2020, Waresix boosted its first-mile operations by acquiring Trukita, another logistics startup.
Tech in Asia data shows that Waresix has raised over US$154 million in total to date from investors like Temasek Holdings, East Ventures, MDI Ventures, and Emtek Group.

Hello reader,
Back in my university days, I remember having so little cash that I was doing whatever I could to save money.
Despite my house being about a 15- to 20-minute walk away from the train station, I’d still walk instead of spending a dollar for a bus ride. Some days, I’d be hanging out late with my girlfriend, and after sending her home, I’d have no more public transportation available. In those instances, bike-sharing was a godsend.
Normally, taking a Grab home would’ve cost me anywhere from S$6 (US$4.50) to S$10 (US$7.40) – that could buy me three or four meals! On the other hand, an Ofo bike ride would cost me less than half that amount.
Those rides were kind of tough, to be honest. Getting home took about 20 minutes, and there were lots of uphill roads too. It also led to one of the craziest incidents I’ve ever experienced, but that’s a story for another time.
Bike-sharing was a cheap, convenient way to travel for a cash-strapped student, and I was always grateful. That’s why I was rather sad to see that many operators closed down following stricter regulations.
One player, however, has emerged from the ashes of the bike-sharing apocalypse: Anywheel. I’m not too familiar with it, given that it was a smaller player compared to Ofo and Mobike, but it’s still going strong even today. Today’s story explores how it survived all these years.
Today we look at:

Two is better than… four?

Anywheel’s story feels a lot like the tale of David and Goliath, and it’s nice to see that sometimes, bootstrapping your way to success is still viable. The best part? There’s still a significant market for bike-sharing services in Singapore, so it’s not like Anywheel only “won” because it’s the last one standing.


Top gear: Today, Anywheel has Singapore’s largest fleet among bike-sharing startups. It has 30,000 bikes that serve 1.3 million users. 

No deposits: Unlike other operators, Anywheel doesn’t charge a deposit. Instead, it offers 30-minute rides starting from US$0.75. 

Fine, I’ll do it myself: The company has been bootstrapped since its inception, and it said that it has been net profitable “from February 2023 all the way until today.” Recently, the firm turned to advertising for revenue, with organizations like OCBC Bank and the Singapore Police Force displaying their ads on Anywheel’s bikes.

All good things must come to an end. Lucas Ngoo, co-founder of ecommerce firm Carousell, has announced that he will step back from managing day-to-day operations at the company.


Hanging around: Ngoo will continue to serve Carousell as a board director, as well as an advisor when necessary. 

Going way back: It’s a significant move, considering that Ngoo co-founded Carousell 12 years ago and has been with it since. He served as the firm’s CTO until 2019. 

A whole new world: Ngoo cites personal reasons for his decision, and that he’s looking to use this break to learn new things such as the applications of AI in biotech and healthcare.

The Indonesian Competition Commission (KPPU) is investigating allegations of monopolistic practices by Shopee, the antitrust body’s spokesperson Deswin Nur told Tech in Asia.
The development arose following Shopee’s alleged decision to automatically direct users to affiliated shipping companies for deliveries, particularly its in-house logistics service, Shopee Xpress.
“This move prevents consumers from choosing courier services from other companies at desired prices,” explained Nur. He added that such practices have led to a “significant increase in shipping volume” for these affiliates, especially Shopee Xpress.
The case is currently under investigation and awaiting trial.
If Shopee is found guilty, the company faces a minimum fine of 1 billion rupiah (around US$64,000), and a maximum of 50% of the net profits or 10% of total sales earned during the period of the violation, according to the spokesperson.
Tech in Asia has reached out to Shopee Indonesia for comments.
Shopee Xpress was first introduced in 2020. According to a previous analysis by Tech in Asia, Shopee has doubled down on investments in property and equipment to expand its logistics facilities since then.
As of February 2023, Shopee Xpress had more than 300 hubs across Southeast Asia. Besides Shopee, Lazada has its own logistics arm called Lazada Logistics, while Tokopedia has GoTo Logistics.

Hello reader,
I recently spoke to a colleague who was involved with bringing our merger with SPH Media over the finish line. One thing I learned is that signing an agreement is just the beginning of a long process.
Getting from that point to finalizing the deal comes with its share of challenges, to say nothing of post-completion matters and the actual integration of two different companies.
However, this is small peas compared to what a merger between rivals Grab and GoTo would involve. Recently, reports of a potential deal between the two super apps have surfaced yet again.
In this week’s featured story, my colleague Jofie and I take a closer look at why this is happening. Hint: It may have something to do with GoTo’s new leadership and the consummation of the deal between Tokopedia and TikTok Shop.
While the media loves to speculate about M&amp;A (Tech in Asia is guilty of that too), any merger between Grab and Gojek is unlikely to happen in the next couple of years.
GoTo is more financially secure than it was in early 2023, when rumors of a union last emerged. A merger is also likely to face plenty of regulatory hurdles, both in Singapore and Indonesia.
All this deal talk between Grab and GoTo reminds me of Nessie or the Loch Ness monster, a mythical marine creature thought to inhabit a lake in Scotland. Every now and then, someone will claim to have seen it, but it is still widely regarded as a myth – for now, at least.

THE BIG STORY

Gojek plus Grab: The merger that neither needs and regulators don’t want
A potential merger can help improve both companies’ cash position. However, regulatory challenges may hinder the plan.

3 Trends to keep an eye on
Hot stocks, earnings reports, restructuring, pressure from activist investors, and more.

Photo credit: Wish

1️⃣ Wish no more: ContextLogic (WISH, NDAQ), the parent company of online shopping platform Wish, has sold its assets and liabilities to Singapore-based Qoo10 for US$173 million.
While this marks a steep decline from its US$14.1 billion valuation when it went public in 2020, the price was still a premium of 44% to its closing price before the sale was announced.
Wish was a pioneer in connecting merchants in China directly to consumers in developed markets like the US, shipping products that were smaller and cheaper to transport.
However, the platform’s user numbers have fallen significantly, and it was unable to compete effectively against the likes of Temu and Shein, which have captivated users looking for a bargain.
Wish’s downfall shows that sometimes, it doesn’t pay to be first.
2️⃣ Uber shoveling cash back to investors: Here’s something that might have seemed unlikely a few years ago. Ride-hailing pioneer Uber (UBER, NYSE) is buying back up to US$7 billion worth of shares for the first time ever.
Share buybacks are an increasingly popular way for tech companies to reward shareholders. They provide liquidity for those who want to sell while remaining shareholders can get a proportionally bigger stake in the company via the reduced the share count.
Uber joins other tech firms like Meta (META, NDAQ) and Airbnb (ABNB, NDAQ) in funneling excess cash to shareholders.
For now, Southeast Asian tech platforms like Sea and Grab are unlikely to follow in their American peers’ footsteps. But they will surely be observing how the market responds to these announcements.
3️⃣ Sony to list financial business: Apart from announcing an estimate-beating 10% increase in operating profit for its third quarter, Japanese tech and entertainment giant Sony (6758, TYO) said it plans to list its financial business in October 2025.
The company will retain a stake of just under 20% in Sony Financial Group while focusing on expanding in the entertainment and image sensor sectors.
This comes as listed Japanese companies are being pressured to create more value for shareholders by implementing corporate governance reforms, unwinding cross shareholdings, and boosting dividends and buybacks.
The moves seem to be working: Japan’s Nikkei index has rallied to its highest level in 34 years, just 2% shy of the all-time high in 1989.

The one you didn’t see coming
We spotlight the story that had everyone talking and social media buzzing during the past week.

Lyft needs to mind its zeros: Typos happen all the time. But you can be sure that employees of Lyft (LYFT, NDAQ) will be extra vigilant in the future after a press release erroneously stated that the ride-hailing platform’s profit margins were set to expand by 500 basis points in 2024.
This sent the US-based firm’s shares surging by 62% in after-hours trading. It turns out that Lyft was expecting margins to expand by a still-commendable 50 basis points.
Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives termed this a “debacle of epic proportions,” saying that he had “never seen an error like this in my almost 25 years on the Street.”
Indeed, this mistake overshadowed what was a good set of results for the company’s long-suffering shareholders.
It also says a lot about what moves the market today, as many trades are done with algorithms processing data – without human oversight. A human would probably have realized how unlikely the 500 basis point figure was.
Yet Lyft might get the last laugh: Its shares were still up by 58% since it announced its results.
No, that isn’t a typo.

That’s it for this edition – we hope you liked it.
Happy investing and see you next time!

Masayoshi Son, founder of Japan-based SoftBank Group, is considering raising US$100 billion for an AI chip venture that could rival US-based Nvidia, sources told Bloomberg.
While SoftBank itself may inject US$30 billion, the rest of the funding could be secured from interested parties in the Middle East.
The project – code-named Izanagi – may signal a shift in strategy for Son, moving from startup investments.
Additionally, the new venture could complement the work of Arm Holdings, the British chip design entity SoftBank previously acquired. Son is said to be teaming up with Rene Haas, CEO of Arm, for Izanagi.
SoftBank has previously teamed up with Nvidia – a rival to Arm – to develop a platform for generative AI and 5G/6G apps.
Nevertheless, if the raise is successful, this would mark one of the largest investments in the AI sector. It is set to outdo recent injections like Microsoft’s US$10 billion bet on OpenAI.
Regardless of Izanagi’s initial stage, Son is positive about the arrival of artificial general intelligence within the next 10 years.

837124,2024-02-19T04:00:44,2024-02-14T05:08:58,"You, me, and everyone else: the inner workings of livestreaming",workings-livestreaming,publish,post,https://www.techinasia.com/workings-livestreaming,"One of my favorite celebrity livestream moments in recent years features Eunkwang, a K-pop idol from the group BTOB. In this particular stream, he was trying to tell a fan who was sad to cheer up – but with his limited English proficiency, that didn’t quite go to plan.
﻿
Eunkwang’s slip-up was hilarious. But it also highlights how livestreaming can connect celebrities, influencers, and other creators with their fans in new ways. The medium has grown all around the world, fueled by the creator economy.
And it’s not just individual influencers who are riding this wave – brands are getting in on the action too. Live selling, anyone?
At Tech in Asia’s annual Product Development Conference in Jakarta last year, I got to peek at the inner workings of livestreaming at a panel featuring IDN Media, a local digital media firm.

Photo credit: Tech in Asia

Organized in partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS), the session was titled “The Rise of Creators Economy: Maximize Your Growth Using Live Streaming Platforms.”
Here’s what went down.
Interaction and engagement
According to Kania Aisha Pasaman, the head of communications at IDN Media, there are three stakeholders in the creator economy: the creators, the brands, and the audience.
Livestreaming bridges the connections between these three players.
“The real-time interaction between the content creator and their audience – I think that’s as close as you can get to real-life interaction,” said Ariel Aulia Widjaja, IDN Media’s head of product.
The media firm pointed to Indonesian-Japanese idol girl group JKT48 as an example of livestreaming in action. Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, JKT48 had near-daily performances at its theater in FX Sudirman, a shopping mall in Jakarta. However, when the pandemic forced these shows to pause, the group had to find other means of connecting with fans.

Livestreaming proved to be an ideal solution, as the group was able to receive and respond to real-time reactions from audience members watching their streams on IDN Live, IDN Media’s livestreaming service. Tools such as virtual gifting and live chatting allowed fans to interact with their favorite idols.
These virtual interactions can help fans feel closer with the idols in a different way than meeting them in real life. Eunkwang’s “give up!” incident, for example, feels like something that could have happened on a video chat with a friend.
The technical details
The technical aspects of setting up a livestreaming platform were also discussed. After all, livestreaming is more than just having a video stream – live chat, gifting, and reaction functions are essential, and the platform needs to be able to accommodate however many people tune in.
IDN Media turned to AWS’ suite of livestreaming tools, known as AWS Interactive Video Service (IVS), to build IDN Live’s capabilities.

Aside from having limited resources to build its own content delivery network, IDN Media had to work within the constraints of its mostly Indonesian audience, where people typically access video content via mobile devices and internet quality differs significantly across the archipelago.
“We needed to choose the right architecture to enable us to move quickly without breaking too many things,” shared Louis Larry, vice president of technology at IDN Media.
The firm used AWS’ infrastructure to develop services such as live chats and stream replays. IDN Media also benefited from IVS’ edge locations in Jakarta, enabling it to ensure low latency and high-quality video delivery.
As we say in the startup world: move fast, break things. By using tried-and-tested tech architecture, IDN Media was able to focus on creating the best experience for creators and their audiences 👍.
All the right messages for all the right people
But of course, at the end of the day, content is king.
“What is your corporate message? What are you trying to say?” said Pasaman. “From there, you’ll find your niche with your audience and see what the audience responds to.”

Photo credit: Tech in Asia

“With livestreaming, the feedback loop works a lot faster,” added Widjaja. “You don’t put out content and wait a few days to see if it works – with livestreaming, it can happen in real time and you can pivot and adjust quickly.”
This makes it more effective as a marketing channel. Case in point: I follow some local Singaporean brands that do try-on livestreams, where team members literally try on clothes from their new collections and model them to the audience. Aside from showcasing the clothes, they also answer questions in real time about everything from the fit to fabric, helping me get to that decision to purchase a lot quicker. It sure beats waiting on a reply from a chatbot.
Some last thoughts
As Southeast Asia’s digital economy continues to develop, I feel like livestreaming will only grow in popularity. If the pandemic has taught us anything, it’s that we can foster connections digitally, even when we’re miles away from each other, allowing a creator in Bali to interact with fans from as far away as Europe.
Additionally, the arrival of platforms like TikTok Shop – where users can consume content and purchase items on the same app – will create more avenues for brands to directly connect with creators and audiences. Social commerce contributed some US$42 billion to the regional ecommerce market in 2022 and livestreaming will remain a core part of that experience on the road ahead.
“Have that growth mindset that anything can happen – there are new technologies, things that we need to adapt to. And by being agile, we can grow,” said Pasaman.

837545,2024-02-19T01:55:25,2024-02-18T16:00:37,GoTo plus Grab: The merger that neither needs and regulators don’t want,goto-grab-merger-regulators-dont-want,publish,post,https://www.techinasia.com/goto-grab-merger-regulators-dont-want,"Simon Huang co-reported this story.
Four years after merger talks were floated between Grab and GoTo, the competing firms have reportedly reopened discussions.
A long-standing rivalry between the two might soon be coming to an end – if the talks come to fruition.
Under one scenario, Grab would acquire GoTo using a combination of cash and shares. This makes sense since Grab’s market capitalization – US$13.8 billion as of February 16 – is around double of GoTo’s.
However, the on-and-off nature of the firms’ exchanges in recent years is a sign that such a deal is easier said than done.

Other factors – including both companies’ financial positions, regulatory concerns, and the complexities of combining two distinctly different operations – lengthen the odds even further.
So far, GoTo has denied reports of any such talks. In response to a query from the Indonesia Stock Exchange after reports of the discussions were published, the firm said that it was currently not having any merger-related dialogues with Grab.
Meanwhile, Grab has said that it doesn’t comment on “rumors or speculations.”
Ripe to do a deal?
On the surface, now would seem like a good time for GoTo to do a deal with Grab.
Gojek co-founder Kevin Aluwi stepped down from GoTo’s board of commissioners last year, making him the last of Gojek’s three co-founders to leave the company.
Patrick Walujo, who took over as CEO of GoTo in June 2023, is a co-founder of the Northstar Group, an early investor in Gojek. Unlike Andre Soelistyo, GoTo’s former CEO, Walujo was never part of Gojek’s original management team who might have seen a sale to Grab as capitulation to a rival.
Moreover, Walujo has not shied away from making decisive moves to improve GoTo’s prospects. The biggest example of this was his decision to cede to TikTok a controlling stake in the Tokopedia-TikTok Shop entity, despite the local player’s larger ecommerce presence in Indonesia.

While some analysts noted that Tokopedia was let go at a “very cheap price,” Walujo said the deal shielded the firm from the fierce competition among ecommerce players in the country.
Meanwhile, Grab has over US$5 billion in net cash liquidity as of September 2023.
While this might not be sufficient for the firm to fully acquire GoTo based on the latter’s current market valuation – US$6.4 billion as of February 16 – Grab could seek additional financing and pay for part of the deal with its shares.
Despite a fall of over 70% since it listed in the US in December 2021, Grab’s share price has been relatively stable since March 2022, which would be an important factor if a deal were to involve paying with the company’s shares.

Yet, this begs the question of why GoTo needs to be acquired and how much value a Grab-GoTo merger could create for each company’s shareholders. And, even assuming that these two questions are answered, any agreement is likely to encounter significant regulatory pushback, given the dominance a combined entity would have in Indonesia and Singapore.
Cash concerns not likely a deal trigger
A year ago, Nirgunan Tiruchelvam, an equity analyst at investment advisory firm Alethia Capital, raised the possibility that GoTo might suffer a cash crunch, with its net cash depleted by the end of 2023.
That prediction has not panned out: GoTo and Grab have seen their financial positions improve since then.

At a group level, Grab reported positive adjusted EBITDA in the three months ending September 2023.
Meanwhile, GoTo achieved this in the fourth quarter of last year, according to a disclosure by the company on January 31, 2024 in relation to the merger with TikTok Shop. The Indonesian player is expected to announce its results for the quarter officially in March.
While adjusted EBITDA is not a substitute for operating profit or actual cash flow from operations, both companies have demonstrated that they are moving in the right direction.
In terms of cash, GoTo seems to be in a secure position. It had US$1.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents as well as time deposits on its balance sheet as of September 2023. Meanwhile, for the 12 months ending September 2023, it spent US$484 million in cash on operations.
Between January to September last year, most of GoTo’s operational losses stemmed from Tokopedia – along with the group’s fintech business. Tokopedia is facing increasingly intense competition, particularly after Sea Group’s commitment to invest more in Shopee to fend off rivals.

Even so, GoTo’s losses as a whole have started to narrow, and the TikTok deal will reduce any further cash burn from Tokopedia, as it removes another competitor from the scene.
As such, a deal with Grab is not likely to be triggered by a fear of running out of funds.
Nailul Huda, director of digital economy at the Center of Economic and Law Studies (Celios), a Jakarta-based think tank, agrees that there is no urgency for the companies to merge, given both firms’ existing cash positions.
He predicts that a merger between the two players “will not happen in the next one or two years,” especially since GoTo has reduced its operating expenses since the Tokopedia deal. That said, Huda notes that the situation could change if GoTo’s financial position worsens.
Potential cost savings
Certainly, a marriage of the rivals could still yield significant financial benefits.
For example, between July and September 2023, GoTo and Grab spent over US$500 million in total on driver and consumer incentives. A potential merger could reduce this amount significantly. Assuming that expenses on incentives are halved, it could result in annualized savings of US$1 billion.
The potential merger could also shift pricing power in the companies’ favor, according to Roshan Raj, a partner at Redseer Strategy Consultants. This would allow the combined entity to raise prices for its services, improving its margins.
A streamlined organization will be able to save on duplicate expenses such as administrative and R&amp;D costs.
“Revenue upside comes from the flexibility to shift towards a cost-plus model,” Raj tells Tech in Asia. The cost-plus model determines a product’s pricing by adding a profit margin to the production cost.

The resulting savings should make for better profitability for the combined entity, generating positive sentiment among public market investors.
On the other hand, the absence of competition could potentially reduce innovation from the company in the long run, Raj notes.
Regulatory obstacles
Even if business conditions were ripe, GoTo and Grab would have to overcome numerous regulatory hurdles before making it to the altar, the most obvious being getting the nod from competition law regulators.
Grab is present in all key markets in Southeast Asia, while GoTo’s main business is in Indonesia, although it also operates in Singapore and Vietnam.
The qualities that make a GoTo-Grab merger so attractive in Indonesia – think combining their dominance of the country’s food delivery and ride-hailing sectors – are exactly what would draw regulatory scrutiny.
In Indonesia, a merged entity will have close to complete control over the ride-hailing market, if taxi services aren’t taken into account.

Combined, both firms would also have a food delivery market share of 88%, based on Momentum Works research. ShopeeFood would be its only other major competitor.
Indonesia’s merger law adopts a mandatory post-closing notification regime. Strictly speaking, this means that parties involved in a merger do not have to notify the regulators before they go through with a deal. They can do so after the agreement is already completed.
Generally, the Indonesian Competition Commission (KPPU) needs to be notified if certain thresholds are met. For example, if the total Indonesian sales of the merged entity exceed 5 trillion rupiah (US$319 million).
If, following its assessment, KPPU finds that a merger has breached competition law, it can retrospectively impose administrative sanctions, including ordering the unwinding of the merger.

Three days after the news of a potential Grab-GoTo deal was reported, KPPU noted that a merger of the two could lead to potential monopolistic practices due to the combined entity’s “high market concentration” in certain sectors.
A KPPU spokesperson added that the Business Competition Law in the country prohibits mergers and acquisitions for this very reason. However, KPPU would have to conduct a proper assessment before reaching any conclusions, the spokesperson said.
Meanwhile, Grab is currently awaiting a decision from the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS), which is conducting an in-depth second phase review of its plan to acquire the taxi company Trans-cab. Grab first announced the plan in July 2023.
Last November, after its first phase of review, the regulator rejected Grab’s proposals, saying that the firm needs to address competition concerns.
Grab can expect an acquisition of Gojek’s ride-hailing business in Singapore to attract an even greater level of scrutiny from the CCCS.
The regulator previously found Grab’s 2018 merger with Uber to be anti-competitive. Given Grab’s even more dominant position now, it is hard to see why it would view a tie-up with Gojek in Singapore differently.
‘Indonesian national champion’ no more?
The final issue of a potential agreement is less tangible but no less important. When Gojek merged with Tokopedia in 2021, it created what some called a “national champion.”
As GoTo went on to list on the Indonesia Stock Exchange, it sold a story of its rise as a homegrown tech icon to hundreds and thousands of Indonesian investors.

No matter the numbers, the optics of an Indonesian tech champion being acquired by a Singapore-based, US-listed rival is unlikely to sit well with many locals. That’s only been made worse now that Tokopedia has essentially come under the control of TikTok, which is owned by Chinese firm ByteDance.
Nevertheless, Celios’ Huda believes that from the industry’s perspective, the acquisition would be beneficial for Indonesian startups. Any deal, including those by foreign companies, provides more exit pathways for local players in the industry, Huda says.
Another issue that this discussion hasn’t even touched is how to integrate two different corporate cultures, which can lead to employee disengagement, loss of morale, conflict, and a loss of productivity.
GoTo’s relatively low share price may make it an interesting play for Grab, but perhaps it’s best to let sleeping dogs lie.

Selling your home directly through an online marketplace without the need for a property agent? Designers marketing their products directly to consumers online without going through a third-party distributor?
That time has come for banks it seems.
For a long time, legacy systems made it challenging for banks to work with ecosystem players.
This meant that ecommerce platforms, ride-hailing firms, and other consumer-facing firms looking to offer financial services, whether credit products or a simple debit card, had to go through intermediaries – banking-as-a-service (BaaS) offering developers – and bank-facing APIs to connect with banks more easily.
Tech providers like Audax, however, now claim their solution can help traditional banks work with these ecosystem firms directly.
Its solution is already helping Standard Chartered – Audax’s majority shareholder – to offer its own BaaS solution, which in turn has enabled firms like Bukalapak to make digital banking services available on the ecommerce platform.
If Audax CEO Kelvin Tan’s thesis is true, that shareholder pressure will in turn drive more banks to offer BaaS solutions themselves as they play catch-up, intermediary firms should be very worried indeed.

Hello reader,
It’s been a relatively quiet week on the funding and acquisitions front, likely because of the recent Lunar New Year celebration. The holiday is a big deal here in Asia, so it makes sense that things have slowed down during this period.
However, it certainly hasn’t been quiet here at Tech in Asia. Last week, we launched Glasswall, a platform that lets startup founders review VCs anonymously, and suffice to say, it has caused quite a stir.
Glasswall was developed as part of our ongoing mission to support Asia’s tech and startup community. There’s long been a kind of information asymmetry in the industry, with VCs having the upper hand, and we want to level the playing field for founders.
We’ve received lots of feedback, positive and negative, from founders and investors alike since Glasswall went out into the world. We’ve also had to reflect deeply on various concerns related to the product, such as content and moderation, and have decided to adopt a more subtle and community-driven approach to drive desired behavior.
It’s still early days for Glasswall, and we’ll continue to iterate and improve on the product. But we firmly believe that driving greater transparency can help take our tech and startup ecosystem to even greater heights.
After all, having good investors is how the startups featured in today’s newsletter got where they are today, y’know?

I’ve rambled on about why we launched Glasswall in the introduction of this newsletter and how you can access it, but check out this article for a snapshot of founders’ reviews and to get a sense of the bigger picture.
2️⃣ No pedal to the metal
VCs appear to have kept the investment brakes on in January 2024. Global startup funding for the month hit almost US$22 billion – a tad below the monthly average for 2023. It seems that venture funding will continue to be constrained this year, although the return of an IPO market could change that. Read more on Crunchbase News.

5️⃣ Changing the playbook
In the face of geopolitical tensions, slower growth, and greater regulation, Chinese VCs have had to rethink how they go about their investments, given that they can no longer rely on big US listings and that the Chinese government has focused more on industrial sectors.

Kumpulan Wang Persaraan (KWAP), a statutory body that manages the pension scheme for Malaysia’s public employees, has invested a total of 100 million ringgit (around US$21 million) into the local startup scene. This marks the fund’s first set of bets under its Dana Perintis program.
In a statement, the organization said that it invested directly in Lapasar, a digital wholesaler in the FMCG sector, and Bateriku, an app offering services such as car battery replacement and vehicle servicing.
Additionally, KWAP funded two venture capital entities – global early-stage VC firm Antler and Malaysia-based Vynn Capital – both of which plan to boost the local startup landscape.
Established in 2007, KWAP manages contributions from the federal government and relevant agencies.
In September 2023, the retirement fund announced it would invest up to around US$105 million over 18 to 24 months through its Dana Perintis program.
Through this initiative, KWAP said it will mainly focus on six sectors: green economy, financial access, food sustainability, aging population, and efforts to address the climate crisis.

Betting big on AI, Singapore has revealed a new S$1 billion (US$742 million) investment into the industry over the next five years.
The initiative was announced by Lawrence Wong, Singapore’s deputy prime minister and minister for finance, during his 2024 budget speech.
Under the plan, the city-state aims to boost its local AI talent pool, secure access to chips crucial for AI tasks, and partner with leading companies to build AI centers.
He asserted that widespread AI integration is key to enhancing productivity across diverse industries, from drug discovery to logistics.
Notably, Singapore also aims to upgrade its nationwide broadband network, targeting speeds of up to 10 gigabits per second by the end of the decade – 10 times faster than what it is today.
The investment builds on Singapore’s revised National AI Strategy, announced in December 2023. In addition to cultivating Singapore’s own pool of AI talent, the national plan also involves bringing in top overseas talent for advanced research and practical applications, among other initiatives.
The city-state is also focusing on Southeast Asia’s first large language model, which will cater to the region’s different cultures and languages.
The project, costing S$70 million (US$52 million), involves collaboration between the Infocomm Media Development Authority, AI Singapore, and the Agency for Science, Technology, and Research.
However, some analysts suggest that Singapore’s AI efforts might benefit from a clearer focus, such as specializing in Southeast Asia-focused language models, rather than attempting to directly compete with broader, more computationally intensive models like GPT-4.

Hello reader,
Do you invest in stocks? I haven’t gotten to that part of my investing journey yet, but some of my friends have.
There was a time when tech stocks were especially exciting, and as a result, I know folks who have bought shares in tech companies like Google, Facebook, and even regional firms like Grab and Sea Group.
As far as I can tell, investing in tech seems to be something of a rollercoaster ride. The outcome is oftentimes affected by factors outside of one’s control, like some bigshot across the world decided that the tech is problematic or something. It seems pretty stressful.
In today’s premium story, we look at an Indonesian tech company that has seen its share price go up in a time when its peers are down. Blibli may not be a big player in Indonesia’s ecommerce scene, but its stock market performance shouldn’t be overlooked.
Today we look at:

Why Blibli is outperforming GoTo and Bukalapak on the stock market  
A pet care startup that’s raised series B money 
Other newsy highlights such as GoTo denying rumors of merger talks with Grab as well as Singtel Innov8 selling its shares in Vizzio back to the startup’s embattled founder 


Premium summary
Up, up, and away

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Among all the major ecommerce platforms in Indonesia, Blibli has the lowest market share. However, in 2023, its shares on the Indonesia Stock Exchange increased by around 2.6%. While the increase isn’t significant, it still performed better than GoTo and Bukalapak, which declined by 8% and 18%, respectively. Let’s take a closer look.


Owners and operations: Blibli focuses on its niche in the electronics category and provides customers with both an online and offline experience. Its stocks are primarily owned by parent company Djarum Group, an association that gives Blibli a stable reputation among the public. The ecommerce firm’s expansion last year was also mostly oriented toward monetization and not just “for the sake of growth.” 

The big picture: However, some experts say that the performance of Blibli’s shares does not reflect the company’s underlying fundamentals in 2023. He says that the decline in GoTo’s and Bukalapak’s shares more accurately reflects the state of the tech sector in the country last year.

The power of travel: Blibli is now working toward profitability. Its marketplace as well as online travel agent (OTA) platform Tiket, which merged with Blibli in 2022, contributed most of the firm’s revenue. The inclusion of Tiket plays a crucial role in the company’s profitability, as the value in OTA products are larger compared to those in the consumer goods segment.

Startup spotlight
For your furry friend

I recently learned of the term DINKWAD, an acronym for “dual income, no kids, with a dog.” It’s hilarious, and it certainly seems to tie in to the wider trend of rising pet ownership – for some folks, their pets are their children.
It’s pretty apt then that India-based pet care startup Supertails has bagged US$15 million in a series B round led by RPSG Capital Ventures.


For the inexperienced: There are many first-time pet owners who don’t always know how to take care of their charges. Supertails, which was founded in 2021, helps tackle this issue by offering a holistic platform for pet care in India. They provide supplies, online vet consultations, and behavioral training services. 

Up next: Aside from fueling business growth and tech investments, Supertails plans to use the funds to expand its healthcare services, which include an online pet pharmacy. It also plans to offer an omnichannel experience in the future.

Setting goals: Supertails is aiming for US$60.2 million in annual recurring revenue within the next two years.

1️⃣ The rumors are not true-mors
GoTo Group has dismissed rumors that it has been in talks regarding a potential merger deal with long-time rival Grab. Earlier this month, a Bloomberg report said that GoTo and Grab have revived these talks, but GoTo said it was only made aware of the development through media reports and shot down the rumor.
2️⃣ All yours
Singtel Innov8, the corporate venture capital fund of Singaporean telco Singtel, has sold all of its 80 preference shares in Vizzio Technologies to the embattled AI firm’s founder Jon Lee. The development follows a series of Tech in Asia exposés on Lee, who was then serving as Vizzio’s CEO, for faking several claims he has made in the past, including his doctorate degree.

VinFast‘s Indonesian expansion plans are off to the races, with the Vietnam-founded company saying it signed deals with five local auto dealers to help launch its brand in the country.
They include GSU, BAM, and GNA – which are all located in Jakarta – as well as MCA in Medan and Majesty in Batam, VinFast revealed at the 2024 Indonesia International Motor Show. The dealers are set to offer four models from the company’s lineup, with sales slated to open later this year.
Pricing and details on the ordering process will be confirmed in the first half of the year, VinFast said in a statement.
The firm is the electric vehicle-focused auto arm of Vingroup, Vietnam’s largest privately owned conglomerate.
A month ago, Vingroup received the green light for VinFast’s expansion into Indonesia from President Joko Widodo.
VinFast plans to invest US$1.2 billion in the country, with US$200 million allocated for constructing an EV manufacturing plant by 2026.
The plant is expected to have a production capacity of 30,000 to 50,000 units annually.
Recently, Vingroup also announced that VinFast is expanding to the Philippines.

Mocaverse, the membership network project by Web3 major Animoca Brands, announced that it will be collaborating with OKX Wallet, Crypto.com DeFi Wallet, and Halo Wallet to bridge the gap between centralized finance platforms and Animoca’s network of projects.
Mocaverse, which was launched in December 2022, is a membership NFT collection for Animoca Brands’ investors and partners. It has recently introduced Moca ID, a decentralized identifier that acts as a user’s proof of identity across various products on the Mocaverse network.
Through the collaboration, users of the OKX, Crypto.com, and Halo wallets will be able to claim their Moca IDs in-app and access the Mocaverse ecosystem.
Moca ID holders can also earn Mocaverse loyalty points by participating and engaging in partner experiences.
Animoca Brands’ marketing initiatives with each of these partners will start in Q1 2024, though the company said it will announce more updates soon.
These partnerships come weeks after Animoca Brands announced its tie-up with HashKey Exchange in a bid to expand Web3 adoption, including its use in the digital entertainment sector.

OpenAI has again flexed its generative AI prowess with Sora, a new model that can create videos from text.
Sora can generate videos up to a minute long while trying to match the user’s prompt. The model can create scenes that feature multiple characters and different types of motion.
While rivals like Google and Meta have already introduced similar tech, the content Sora produces appears to be more realistic. Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO, has shared output from the model based on prompts from users of X (formerly Twitter).
The company added that Sora has an understanding of language, visual concepts, and physics, enabling it to generate various subjects in different styles.
While Sora is not available to the public yet, OpenAI is already taking safety measures to prevent its misuse. The organization is working with red teamers – experts who test for security vulnerabilities – to check the model for possible abuse.
The firm is also building tools to help identify fake content generated through Sora, such as a detection classifier and a metadata tag. Moreover, it is implementing existing safety methods that it built for its products that use DALL-E 3, another AI model that can create images from text.

Business publication The Edge first reported the development on February 5. It said that Carsome and Carro were among a number of companies looking to snag these licenses.
The incumbent, Puspakom, is owned by politically connected tycoon Syed Mokhtar Albukhary, who also controls Bursa-listed conglomerate DRB-Hicom. Syed Mokhtar was awarded the license following a privatization exercise in the ‘90s under former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad.
The monopoly over inspection services helped Syed Mokhtar turn Puspakom into a comprehensive national vehicle inspection firm over the last three decades.
While the size of this new license isn’t reported, Puspakom’s company filings show that the company posted 13.5 million ringgit (US$2.8 million) in net profit on the back of 165.2 million ringgit (US$34.6 million) in revenue for 2022. That year, it also paid out dividends amounting to 5 million ringgit (US$1 million).
For context, MyTukar posted a gross profit of 25 million ringgit in 2022 (US$5.2 million), while the equivalent figure for Carsome’s Malaysia unit is 272 million ringgit (US$56.9 million).
(Carsome netted an after-tax loss of 257 million ringgit [US$53.8 million] at the company level for 2022, but for illustrative purposes, we subtracted revenue from cost of cars sold.)
Carsome declined comment while Carro chief financial officer Ernest Chew tells Tech in Asia that the firm would be interested in applying for the license if given the opportunity to do so.
Not so straightforward
Malaysian law stipulates that all commercial vehicles need to be inspected by Puspakom every six months. But Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim’s government moved to progressively phase out Puspakom’s monopoly on the service.
Transport Minister Anthony Loke told the press that this is in line with the government’s aim to create a competitive service environment. Puspakom’s monopoly has been the subject of a review since 2018, but due to political instability, no material changes were made to these concessions.
Anwar’s government, however, decided to jumpstart the 2018 review and is looking at a number of firms running monopolies. Puspakom is the first company affected by the policy.
Kuala Lumpur-based public officials tell Tech in Asia on condition of anonymity that the government has yet to open a tender for vehicle inspection services. However, businesses are already lobbying the transport ministry and relevant agencies for the licenses.
One source says Carsome and Carro will see tough competition as they would be up against government-linked companies as well as those owned by royalty.

Officials tell us that other contenders for the license may include government-linked corporation Sime Darby and family-run conglomerates Berjaya and Naza. Sime Darby, a Bursa-listed group with a market capitalization of 16.8 billion ringgit (US$3.5 billion), has a dedicated auto unit called Sime Darby Motors that provides end-to-end vehicle services from assembly to rentals. The firm’s service centers are also equipped to run vehicle inspections.
Berjaya and Naza, too, are large conglomerates that have been selling cars since the ‘90s. Naza, in particular, grew into a diversified group on the back of importing and distributing Asian and European marques. Both conglomerates also provide vehicle inspection services.
It’s worth mentioning that Carsome collaborated with Naza in 2022 to launch the Carsome PJ Automall. This is located within Naza’s Automall showroom in Petaling Jaya, just outside the Malaysian capital city of Kuala Lumpur.
One source tells us that some of the points the tender committee will be looking at in selecting licensees include track record, ability to meet demand, digitalization of services, and backing from institutional shareholders.
All the right ingredients
On paper, Carsome and Carro fit the bill as they already inspect used cars prior to placing them on their respective platforms for sale. These platforms provide an inspection report for each vehicle so that all car dealers have access to standardized information before the bidding process starts.
Both companies also have Malaysian government-linked institutional backing. Sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional is an investor in Carsome, while Carro counts Sime Darby and asset manager Permodalan Nasional as backers.
While Sime Darby is an investor in Carro, whether both companies bidding for the licenses will amount to a conflict will depend on the details of the contract. Usually, companies will declare conflicts in their application.
Kuala Lumpur-based analysts tracking Carsome and Carro believe that snagging a license can open up more revenue channels for both firms, especially a “golden goose,” referring to government concessions and contracts.
Not only would the license help the two platforms build credibility, it would also open up opportunities for them to win other government contracts or even receive greater institutional funding from state-owned investors, the analysts say.
They add that this could also look good on their books as both companies are looking to go public.
But the analysts caution that exposure to government contracts, while lucrative, also come with the added risk of political instability. The chances of a review or cancellation of such concessions can happen in the event of a regime change, they say.

It’s also led to much internal discussion on various issues including content. We’ve asked ourselves: To what extent do we moderate content, and how should we go about it?
Our answer (for now, at least) is that there’ll be no moderation, except in a few extreme cases. Instead, we’re taking a community-led approach to drive high-quality reviews.
I know some of our VC friends might balk at this, but hear me out.

Firstly, we want to point out that Glasswall is not journalism. Instead, it is a forum and a platform, so it should be treated as such.
Tech in Asia, after all, hasn’t been doing just journalism. We also provide a jobs, events, and database platform for Asia’s tech community. Glasswall simply extends our database feature.
Secondly, Glasswall is a product built mainly for founders, and very few of them want reviews to be moderated.
As one of them said: “I wouldn’t moderate, really. I feel like it reflects the current state of the ecosystem. I see that some funds are reacting internally because of Glasswall. The point is that Glasswall makes the VCs more conscious, and hopefully that leads to growth and improvement.”
And lastly, aggressive moderation opens a can of worms. Seemingly arbitrary rules would have to be enforced, and they end up pleasing no one.
Yes, the Tech in Asia team is aware that a poorly maintained garden could be overrun by weeds. Also, I’m reminded of a community library for kids in my neighborhood that eventually turned into a dumping ground for trash.
Trash, of course, warrants immediate removal. For Glasswall, that includes reviews that are racist and sexist or comments that encourage violence. But few remarks fall into this category.
In most cases, we’ll adopt a more subtle approach to drive desired behavior.
As a start, we’ve published a set of guidelines that details what makes a review of high quality or low quality.
We’re also in the process of upgrading Glasswall. Here’s what you can expect in the coming weeks:

We’ll encourage reviewers to register an account, but we won’t mandate it. Reviews from registered users will be labeled as such.
Reviews that are highly likely to be fake will also be marked accordingly.
We’ll add a “report” button so users can flag harmful or false reviews.

We won’t stop there, of course, and we’re studying other platforms like Glassdoor and Reddit for ideas.
Ultimately, though, we’re not bound to any philosophy.
We’ll make tweaks as needed to follow our north star: That Glasswall remains a useful product for founders. Everything else is secondary.

Here’s a tweet that I came across recently. It’s a reminder of why Glasswall was created.

Lucas Ngoo, co-founder of Carousell / Photo credit: Carousell

Carousell co-founder Lucas Ngoo has announced that he would step down from managing day-to-day operations at the online marketplace.
In a post on LinkedIn, Ngoo said that he will remain with Carousell in the capacity of co-founder and board director. He will also step in as an adviser when necessary.
“I continue to have full vested interests in the success of Carousell as a co-founder, board director, and shareholder, and have full confidence in our business and leadership team,” he said.
He has been with Carousell since its inception nearly 12 years ago, and was the platform’s CTO until September 2019, when Igor Volynskiy took over the role.
The decision to step away from Carousell is a personal one, with Ngoo looking to take a break to learn new things such as AI in biotech, healthcare, and climate tech, among others.
The move comes after Carousell laid off 110 employees in December 2022 and moved into a cheaper office as part of cost-cutting measures. During the opening of the new headquarters, co-founder and CEO Quek Siu Rui said that the platform is well-capitalized.
“This is just the start of our second decade of Carousell, and there is more to come. Please continue to lend your support to our CarouTeam, as I will,” said Ngoo.

While some B2B ecommerce firms are struggling, others are thriving. India-based Metalbook, a B2B platform focused on the global metal supply chain, said it is eyeing US$200 million in annualized revenue run rate by the end of the 2024 fiscal year.
Founded in 2021, the startup has raised US$15 million in a series A round led by Rigel Capital. FJ Labs participated, as well as existing investors Axilor Ventures and Stride Ventures, among others.
Metalbook helps customers through their entire metal manufacturing and procurement cycle. This includes everything from buying and selling to customization, logistics, scrap recycling, as well as financing.
Raghavendra Pratap Singh, Pulkit Baldev, and Aman Tibrewal had co-founded the startup to create a full-stack digital supply-chain platform which would connect a global network of metal suppliers and consumers.
The company claimed to be profitable and caters to over 1,000 customers across 450 markets. It has added new categories such as copper, aluminum, and metal scrap to its already existing offerings.
“We want to make sure that there is enough of a track record for market investors to look at before we plan for an IPO in four to five years,” Singh said.
It previously secured US$5 million of seed funding in mid-2022.

Photo credit: Paytm

Following a freeze from India’s central bank, Paytm Payments Bank has now found itself on the radar of Enforcement Directorate (ED), the Indian government agency that probes economic crimes and financial fraud.
The agency is probing foreign transactions by the bank, which is an affiliate of fintech major Paytm, according to a Reuters report. The article cited sources close to the company as well as those from the government.
The inquiry primarily focused on past transactions suspected to violate foreign exchange regulations, the report added, while the government source said that it is a “preliminary examination.”
In a filing to the country’s stock exchange, Paytm clarified that it “does not undertake Outward Foreign Remittance.”
Meanwhile, Paytm’s stock rout continues with the company losing 55% in value since end-January, which was when the central bank issued restrictions on the company’s banking affiliate.
At the time of writing, the stock was trading at US$3.9 per share.
Vijay Shekhar Sharma, Paytm’s founder and the affiliate bank’s non-executive chairman, has met Reserve Bank of India officials to seek respite. However, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das has made it clear that there is “hardly any room for review” on the decision.
Stockbroking firm Macquarie has since projected Paytm’s revenue to decrease by 60% to 65% between the 2025 fiscal year and FY 2026.

Hello reader,
One of the common questions relatives ask during Lunar New Year is, “How’s work?”
For Lim Teck Yong, he could answer – with no hyperbole – that he beat Shopee in a court of law.
The ecommerce giant had sued him for moving to ByteDance and allegedly breaching noncompetition and nonsolicitation restrictions in his employment contract. But the case was dismissed.
If I were Lim, that’s a neat little story I’d be taking every opportunity to bring up.

I’m obviously no legal expert, but my PR-angle lens on the Shopee situation is focused on the optics of the case. There are very few cases where the big corporation is going to be viewed favorably by the public at large when it’s suing an individual, especially for something as simple as changing jobs.
On the balance of things, it just doesn’t seem like it was the brightest idea to sue Lim. Even if Shopee had won, it would’ve looked like a real bully. That’s also the opinion of one of the experts Tech in Asia spoke with.


Perception matters: “Generally, big corporate organizations that sue individuals will be in a David vs. Goliath situation, and they need to carefully manage communications with key stakeholders to ensure the correct narrative is communicated,” says Cho Pei Lin, a litigation PR expert.

A human factor: “As for the ethics of noncompete clauses, I think it’s pretty simple. When you limit where someone can work after they quit your company, you’re not just tampering with their LinkedIn profile; you’re manipulating the very DNA of social mobility,” adds Leigh McKiernon, a C-level headhunter in Indonesia.

The individual surely has more to lose than the big corpo: “Another factor that a court examines is something called the ‘balance of convenience.’ This means that the court will take whichever course appears to carry the lower risk of injustice, should that course turn out to be ultimately ‘wrong,’” points out Max Ng, who leads the regional law practice at Gateway Law Corporation and Gateway IP Services.

There’s a new player in the genAI space that’s looking to go head-to-head with big names like Google and Microsoft. US-based AI startup Reka has recently rolled out Reka Flash, its newest language model.


Woohoo, Singapore pride: One of the company’s founders is Yi Tay, a Singaporean who serves as Reka’s chief scientist. He, along with the other founders, previously worked as researchers for companies like Google DeepMind and Meta.

So many billions: According to the firm, Reka Flash has 21 billion parameters. It added that based on its evaluations, the model is competitive with Google Bard’s Gemini Pro and OpenAI’s GPT-3.5.

Test one, test two: Reka Flash is currently available for beta testing, along with a more compact version of the model called Reka Edge.

Prabowo Subianto looks set to become Indonesia’s next president after securing close to 60% of votes in Wednesday’s elections, according to unofficial quick counts that have historically proven accurate. If officially announced as the winner, he – along with vice presidential candidate Gibran Rakabuming Raka – will be inaugurated on October 20, 2024.
Broadly, the pair aims for continuity with the policies of current president Joko Widodo (Jokowi). But what, specifically, are their plans for startups and the digital economy?
One planned program is a loan scheme for tech and innovation-based businesses. This would follow the Merah Putih Fund launched by the Jokowi administration in September 2023.
According to Subianto’s campaign spokesperson Puteri Anetta Komarudin, the scheme will be similar to applying for a bank loan. However, the capital will come from the government’s budget, not a third party.
“We will definitely be very careful and not arbitrary in distributing the credit,” Komarudin tells Tech in Asia. “That’s why we will analyze each business plan carefully.”
Foreign investment will also be a key focus for the new government. This includes simplifying regulations and providing incentives for foreign investors, such as tax holidays and tax allowances.
The hope is that Indonesian startups would no longer have to establish parent entities in Singapore, which many do to placate foreign investors.
Meanwhile, the Jokowi government’s ban on direct transactions on social media – which led to TikTok Shop’s temporary shutdown – will also continue in the new administration, according to Komarudin.
Finally, electric vehicles will also remain a priority, with Subianto slated to continue Jokowi’s incentives and subsidies.
State-owned Indonesia Battery Corporation is also building an EV battery factory in Karawang, West Java, in collaboration with South Korea’s LG Energy Solution and Hyundai Motor Group. Touted to be the country’s first and largest EV battery factory, the facility is expected to start operating later this year.
Subianto and Raka aim to make Indonesia “the ‘king’ of EV batteries globally” by tapping into the country’s nickel resources, says Komarudin.

But while yellow Ofos and orange Mobikes were ubiquitous at the time, Anywheel was a relatively small player.

Image credit: Timmy Loen

“We came together at the same time as the big boys, [but] they’re all backed by a billion dollars,” says Aung, who also serves as the firm’s CEO, in an interview with Tech in Asia. On the other hand, Anywheel was bootstrapped, relying on funds from Aung’s family and friends.
Seven years on, former market leaders Ofo, Mobike, and oBike are all defunct. But bike-sharing as a service still serves an important niche as a transportation option in Singapore.

And despite the odds, Anywheel still stands. It now has Singapore’s largest fleet among bike-sharing startups, numbering at 30,000, and it has 1.3 million users.
“There is a negative view of micromobility sharing in Southeast Asia that we’ve been trying to repair,” says Aung, whose company is also present in Thailand. “Only in these last two years have people started to appreciate our service.”
Last-mile vs. leisure
According to Aung, there were two factors that led to the negative perception of bike-sharing. The first is parking.
Companies like Ofo and oBike were notorious for being freely available, which led to indiscriminate parking of their bikes around Singapore. Unlike overseas players like Citi Bike in the US, there were no designated bike racks nor parking rules.
That changed in 2018, when the Land Transport Authority introduced rules that govern parking for bike-sharing. Currently, there are 25,000 stations – which includes almost every parking lot owned by Singapore’s Housing and Development Board – with a bike-sharing QR code.
That year was also the beginning of the end for Ofo, oBike, and Mobike – at least in Singapore. All of them no longer operated in the city-state by mid-2019.
The second issue was deposits. Users of oBike, for one, had faced difficulties getting their deposits refunded as the company found itself in a cash crunch.
But even from the beginning, Anywheel had never required deposits. That stems from Aung’s past experience as part of a bike-sharing startup in Australia.
That company’s “deposit rate was A$70 (US$45.90), and within a few months, we were sitting on about 2 million Australian dollars’ (US$1.3 million) worth of deposits,” he says.
“Deposits will generate a lot of cash flow to buy more devices more quickly, which many of the companies did,” the CEO adds, referring to the Australian startup as well as Singapore players. “But look at what happened to them.”

Instead, Anywheel charges from as low as S$1 (US$0.75) for a 30-minute ride on a regular bike. It also offers an Anywheel Pass, where higher-frequency users can choose from 7-day, 30-day, or 90-day passes for unlimited uses of the company’s bikes.
Other external factors also worked in its favor. During the Covid-19 pandemic, it identified a new use case: leisure riding.
Aung says that during the pandemic, the average Anywheel ride went between 40 to 50 minutes per trip. Once the pandemic wound down, though, the team worried whether people would stop leisure riding as much.
Singapore-based bike-rental service GoBike, for one, positions itself solely for leisure rides, with users having to rent its bikes for a minimum of two hours. Laurent Misso, the company’s CEO, says that bike-sharing as a last-mile transport option is “something I would call ‘good-to-have’.”
“We relate cycling more to a hobby or family activity rather than as a mode to get around,” he adds. “In Singapore, I can take a bus or train to basically go anywhere I like.”
Nonetheless, Anywheel found that its customers did go through another kind of behavioral change after the pandemic: around 60% of rides now happen between residential areas and a train station or bus stop.
“The majority of our trips now are really serving the first and last miles, instead of leisure,” Aung says. “In the last one year or so, our average distance is about 2.1 kilometers, with most rides happening within 20 minutes.”
Ads on wheels
Anywheel has been bootstrapped since the beginning, which lets the company grow organically and “do what we truly believe in,” Aung says. While VC firms may have the same vision as he does, “they are more driven by returns and substantial growth in a much shorter time.”
The founder has only spoken to one VC back in 2019, which did not lead to an investment. That said, Anywheel plans to fundraise in the middle of this year, which could help with expansion plans: the company is aiming to launch in a third Southeast Asian country by Q3 2024, while also assessing a fourth market outside the region.
Aung adds that Anywheel is also planning to expand to more cities in Thailand, while applying for a larger license from LTA that would bring its Singapore fleet above 30,000.
While the CEO declines to disclose financial specifics, he says that the company has been net profitable “from February 2023 all the way until today.”
A risk factor for Anywheel, however, is the rain. The CEO says that revenue and ridership wasn’t affected “that much” amid Singapore’s high precipitation the past two months, though it did affect month-on-month growth.
These considerations led him to a weather-resistant source of revenue: advertising.
Having done it for 1.5 years, advertising is still a nascent revenue stream for Anywheel. Its ad rates range from S$15 to S$100 (US$11.15 to US$74.31) per bike per month.
Aung notes that it has been a major cash source for overseas bike-sharing players. Citigroup, for instance, paid about US$111 million for a 10-year sponsorship of Citi Bike in New York City.

It’s unclear whether Anywheel’s rivals are considering a similar strategy. HelloBike, an Alibaba-backed competitor that is also available in Singapore, earned revenue only from subscription and single-ride fees, according to its 2022 financial statements.
In China, bike-sharing is still popular, but it also operates under a different premise. The players have since been acquired by tech giants like Alibaba and Meituan.
This means that instead of a key revenue generator, bike-sharing works as a “complementary service within a larger company,” notes Jeffrey Towson, formerly a professor at Peking University and partner at TechMoat Consulting.
“Bikes don’t generate enough cash flow to do that well as a stand-alone business,” he explains. “But it is a high-frequency service that people use daily or weekly.”
Still, it might not be realistic for Anywheel to earn ad revenue of Citi Bike’s scale, at least right off the bat.
“We are still educating [the potential clients], convincing them that we are a responsible operator, unlike some from last time who just came and went and left a negative impact,” Aung says.
Clients so far have included OCBC Bank, NTUC, and the Singapore Police Force.
Advertising on these bikes also has its unique advantages. For one thing, the bikes move at a smaller pace than cars, which helps attract pedestrian eyeballs. Compared to advertising on cars or even large electronic billboards, it is relatively eco-friendly.
“Besides Singapore and maybe some parts of Thailand, no other parts of Southeast Asia is in [the same level of] carbon neutrality,” Aung says. “So we are still pushing – we need this whole ecosystem to go up.”

East Ventures has appointed Sang Han as its first partner for its South Korea fund, which was launched in October in partnership with Seoul-based VC firm SV Investment.
According to Han’s LinkedIn profile, he has worked in venture capital from as early as 2005, when he was an assistant vice president at Walden International for Singapore and Beijing.
Prior to joining East Ventures, Han was a partner at Cento Ventures. He was also a senior executive director at Vertex Ventures and a managing director at Temasek Life Sciences Accelerator.
“Leveraging extensive experience in both Korea and Southeast Asia, we believe Sang stands as an instrumental addition to our team in connecting corridors for our investments and funds between these regions,” said Willson Cuaca, co-founder and managing partner at East Ventures.
East Ventures and SV Investment aim to raise US$100 million for the South Korea fund. It will target local firms in sectors such as biotech and healthcare, future mobility, greentech, as well as media and content.
The fund also aims to help South Korean companies go public in international markets and increase knowledge-sharing.
Founded in 2009, East Ventures has invested in more than 300 tech companies across Southeast Asia, from the seed stage to the growth stage. It has been an early backer for companies such as Tokopedia, Traveloka, Ruangguru, ShopBack, Waresix, and Xendit.
Earlier this month, the VC firm teamed up with Indonesia’s chamber of commerce and industry as well as research firm WRI Indonesia to launch Ecovisea, a free global greenhouse gas calculator for businesses in Indonesia.

In India, demand for pets is on the rise – so much so that the country’s pet care market is estimated to reach US$1.9 billion by 2030.
However, that also means an influx of first-time pet owners who don’t always know how to take care of their charges. That’s where companies like Supertails come in.
An India-based pet care startup, Supertails addresses the needs of inexperienced owners by offering a holistic platform for pet care in India. They provide supplies, online vet consultations, and behavioral training services.
The startup has raised about US$15 million in series B funding led by RPSG Capital Ventures. Existing investors, including Fireside Ventures and DSG Consumer Partners, participated.
Aside from fueling business growth and tech investments, the startup plans to use the funds to expand its healthcare services, which include an online pet pharmacy. It also plans to offer an omnichannel experience in the future.
Founded in June 2021, Supertails says it is aiming for US$60.2 million in annual recurring revenue within the next two years. It raised its series A round in late 2022, a US$10 million round led by Fireside Ventures.

Like what its name implies, soft electronics are made from materials resembling soft tissue, instead of the traditional rigid components like silicon chips and circuit boards.
They are poised to transform several fields. For instance, electronic patches can conform to one’s skin and integrate with an individual’s nervous system, restoring lost functions or introducing new sensory experiences.
Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University has developed a number of ultra-thin and stretchable electronics. While patent pending, the university is establishing a pilot laboratory for the prototyping of the tech.
The lab also plans to work with industry partners, including SMEs, to co-develop soft electronics.
Developed by a team of scientists led by Professor Chen Xiaodong, these soft electronics – whose size can be thinner than human hair – can be integrated into wearable devices. It can then enable real-time monitoring of vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels.
Soft electronics also has applications in agriculture. By attaching soft sensors to plants, users can monitor the plants’ health and control their actions, which can help mitigate crop diseases.
“We aim to address some of humanity’s most pressing challenges, from climate change to healthcare advancements,” said Professor Chen in a statement. “My goal is to establish a new center of excellence for soft electronics, building a team of industry experts and commercial partners to swiftly bring these technologies to market.”

Hello reader,
Happy Valentine’s Day! For a laugh, I asked ChatGPT to give me a list of funny Valentine’s greetings. Here are some of the results:

Roses are red, violets are blue, I hope this card makes you smile, and not say “eww”!
Happy Valentine’s Day to my partner in crime! Let’s steal some hearts and maybe a few chocolates, too.
You’re the bacon to my eggs, the cheese to my macaroni, and the one who always steals the covers. Happy Valentine’s Day, you blanket bandit!

I’m particularly amused by the last one because I’m a notorious blanket thief. My partner and I have agreed that when we finally move in together, we’ll each have one huge blanket to minimize theft and maintain harmony in our home.
It was fun to use ChatGPT in a more personal context, and it’s perhaps one of the more common applications of generative AI these days. Many individuals are embracing genAI to help them work more productively, but in today’s premium story, we find that businesses are a different matter altogether.

The age of AI

Even if you’ve been living under a rock, you’re probably aware of how genAI has taken the world by storm. As the hype dies down, though, it seems clear that while Southeast Asian businesses are excited by the tech’s possibilities, they haven’t taken the next step of integrating genAI into their core business.


Approach with caution: A poll conducted by Tech in Asia among 25 startup founders in Southeast Asia found that many companies in the region are hesitant about investing in AI. Most are also unsure about increasing their spending on AI without seeing a clearer path to getting a return on their investment.

The good and bad: Those who have added AI to their workflow say they use it to cut costs and to hone their business strategies. They also tap the tech for general administrative purposes like creating marketing or sales content, summarizing reports, and managing emails. However, they also face challenges such as AI hallucinations and difficulties with getting customers on board. 

The employment question: While all the founders that Tech in Asia spoke to saw advantages to AI, many were concerned about its long-term effects, particularly on employment. Where do the productivity gains from AI go: to employees or employers?

1️⃣ Taking his leave
Hamish Daud, co-founder and chief marketing officer at Indonesian waste treatment startup Octopus, has stepped down from his position, citing “personal reasons.” In January, a Tech in Asia exposé revealed that  Moehammad Ichsan, Octopus’ CEO who is also a co-founder, had shared misleading information about his academic degrees on multiple platforms.
Ichsan, however, denied that he had made such claims. The startup is also reportedly undergoing operational changes amid allegations of unpaid salaries and other poor business practices.
2️⃣ A roof over your head
Amber, an India-based startup that aims to help students secure housing, has raised US$21 million in a funding round led by Gaja Capital. Founded in 2017, Amber provides verified listings, virtual tours, and expert guidance as well as an AI-powered dynamic pricing engine and a dashboard tool for property managers.
3️⃣ Taking a break
Iwan Kurniawan, co-founder of peer-to-peer lending platform Modalku, has left the firm “take a career break to explore [his] passions,” he wrote in a LinkedIn post. Kurniawan has been with Modalku for almost eight years, having helped the firm to expand in Indonesia and enter Thailand.
4️⃣ No, not the &amp; symbol
Amperesand, a Singapore-based electrical infrastructure company, has raised over US$12.4 million in seed funding. Incubated at the Nanyang Technological University,  Amperesand offers grid infrastructure solutions that can help improve EV charging hardware built on solid-state transformer technology.
5️⃣ GoGrab?
Grab and GoTo Group have reopened merger talks four years after their initial discussion. Both companies could be hoping to stem their ongoing losses amid their long-running rivalry via a merger, which would have far-reaching effects on Southeast Asia’s ride-hailing and food delivery spaces.
6️⃣ Lowering the stakes
SoftBank Group sold a major chunk of its stake in India’s Paytm just before the country’s central bank imposed sanctions that sent the fintech firm’s share price tumbling by over 42% within three days.

Welcome to The Top Up! Delivered every fortnight via email and through the Tech in Asia website, this free newsletter breaks down the biggest stories and trends in fintech. Get it in your email inbox by registering here.
Hi there,
Today, many of us have the option of renting something instead of buying it – from clothes to cars, home appliances to houses.
Similarly, many tech companies today – like ecommerce and ride-hailing platforms – want to embed financial services into their offerings, but they typically don’t have the required licenses and the expertise to do so. One option for them is to “rent” the expertise from banks.
However, as my colleague Melissa shares in this week’s featured story, many banks are burdened with legacy infrastructure and may not be in the best position to offer their services to these tech firms.
That’s where tech providers like Audax come in. The company helps banks that are looking to work with these businesses offer financial services to users. Or, firms can also choose to work directly with fintech-as-a-service providers like Hugo Hub to enable different financial services.
New digital bank entrants launching using a banking-as-a-service (BaaS) model can do so with a lower customer acquisition cost: around US$20 instead of the typical US$100, or at least that’s what Audax CEO Kelvin Tan says.
The theme of whether to own/build something or to rent it from someone else continues in this week’s Hot Take, where I look at how DBS has taken a different approach to managing its data compared to its peers UOB and OCBC.

THE BIG STORY
Out with the middlemen: more firms tap banks and BaaS providers for embedded finance

Using banking-as-a-service solutions, digital banks can lower the cost of acquiring a new customer from US$100 to US$20, tech provider Audax claims.

THE HOT TAKE
DBS faces digital travails despite record earnings

DBS Bank / Photo credit: DBS Bank

Here’s what happened:

Southeast Asia’s largest bank reported a record net profit of S$10.3 billion (US$7.7 billion) in 2023, with better-than-expected fourth quarter net profit.
Despite this, DBS CEO Piyush Gupta’s variable pay was slashed by 30%, deeper than the group management committee’s 21% cut. This was due to a series of digital disruptions in the bank’s home market.
The bank is returning more cash to shareholders, with an increased dividend payout and a bonus issue of shares.

Here’s our take:
DBS reported a good set of results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023, sending its shares up by 2.5% in the trading session that followed.
Typically, such news would be accompanied with pay increments for senior management.
However, in this case, the bank’s senior management saw their variable compensation collectively reduced by 21%, with Gupta seeing a larger cut amounting to US$3.1 million.
This followed several disruptions to DBS’ services in 2023, prompting the Monetary Authority of Singapore to prohibit the bank from pursuing new business ventures for a six-month period.
During an outage on October 14, 2.5 million payment and ATM transactions were affected as a result of a technical glitch at a data center operated by Equinix, which is a global provider of network communications services.
The outages were quite an embarrassment for DBS, which has been named the “world’s best digital bank” and the “most innovative in digital banking” by various publications.
As society becomes increasingly digital, it is vital to get the basics right.
To be fair, DBS isn’t the only bank to suffer from such outages. The October 14 disruption also affected Citibank, which uses the same data center.
Singapore banks UOB and OCBC also saw their online services disrupted last November.
Notably, these financial institutions diverge when it comes to how they manage their data. Fifteen years ago, DBS chose to outsource the running of its data centers, while OCBC and UOB manage their own.
There’s no right or wrong answer to which approach is better. On the one hand, companies like Equinix and SingTel specialize in running data centers, an expertise that banks don’t typically have.
As Gupta previously said, it would be “very hard” for a bank to manage data centers as well as be a professional operator, as a bank’s core job is not to manage physical infrastructure.
DBS’s October outage was the first to be caused by a data center issue, he noted.
On the other hand, one can argue that data management is now so intrinsic to running a bank that it is vital for them to have this expertise in-house. OCBC has said that it made the choice to own its data centers because of the need for “absolute control” over its security and design.
In a world of increasing specialization, where companies can outsource everything from payments to HR to external players, firms have to determine the right balance to strike between doing something in-house versus having a third party – who is ostensibly better placed – perform the function.

Photo credit: Vizzio

Singtel Innov8, a Singapore-based VC firm, has sold all of its 80 preference shares in Vizzio Technologies to the embattled AI firm’s founder Jon Lee.
According to filings with Singapore’s Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority, the transaction also removes the S$1 million (US$740,000) in paid-up share capital that Singtel Innov8 injected into Vizzio – an amount now shouldered by Lee.
Data from Alternatives.pe, which tracks filings in Singapore, show that Singtel Innov8 had only acquired the 80 shares four months ago.
The development follows a series of Tech in Asia exposés on Lee, who was then serving as Vizzio’s CEO, for faking several claims he has made in the past, including his doctorate degree.
Vizzio’s board initially supported Lee after the first exposé went out but later appointed an interim CEO – a move suggesting that Lee had stepped down from the role.
Notably, one board member, Kai Fu Lee, resigned from the board shortly before the initial story was published. However, Sinovation Ventures – the VC firm led by the renowned AI researcher – still holds 384 shares in Vizzio.

Indonesian tech giant GoTo Group has dismissed rumors that it has been in any talks regarding a potential merger deal with long-time rival Grab.
Grab and Gojek previously held initial discussions on such a deal roughly four years ago, but a concrete plan did not materialize. Instead, Gojek merged with ecommerce platform Tokopedia to form GoTo.
Earlier this month, however, a Bloomberg report said that GoTo and Grab have revived these talks, with the former now more open to a merger deal under Patrick Walujo – who took on the role of CEO in 2023.
However, in a filing with the Indonesia Stock Exchange, GoTo said it was only made aware of the development through media reports and shot down the rumor.
GoTo highlighted its “increasingly strong fundamentals and financial position,” having recently hit adjusted EBITDA profitability in the fourth quarter of 2023. The company also emphasized its recent deal with TikTok, which it said will directly contribute to the group’s EBITDA results.
“The company will continue to focus on growing healthily and profitably by enhancing product innovation and operational excellence in our on-demand services and financial technology businesses, as well as enhancing shareholder value,” GoTo wrote in the filing.

Over a hundred million Bukalapak customers and merchants in Indonesia can open an account digitally in under two minutes, pay for purchases within the platform, or get a digital or physical debit card. Some can also obtain credit.

Image credit: Bukalapak

Like Bukalapak, ecommerce firms, online travel agencies, and fintech firms and many other companies are looking to embed financial services into their platforms to scale and acquire more users – all without a banking license.
While the trend of embedded finance isn’t new, increasing pressure from shareholders on banks to lower operational costs and raise profits are driving more banks – which already own these licenses – to enter the fray. They’re enabling such firms to offer financial services themselves instead of relying on intermediaries to do so.
By lending their core banking infrastructure, balance sheets, and licenses to entities like ecommerce platforms, banks gain new revenue streams and tap new customer segments. The use of digital channels also reduces user acquisition cost as well as the need for physical branches and large sales teams.
In the case of BukaTabungan, not only did Standard Chartered gain new customers, but 98% of them have never banked with the UK-headquartered institution.
How does a bank or a financial institution offer such services, especially if it’s bogged down by legacy infrastructure? That’s where tech providers come in.
Banks enter the fray
Rising shareholder pressure on banks have driven the conversation around “how best to generate returns on the existing cost base,” says Kelvin Tan, CEO of tech provider Audax. The firm powers Nexus, Standard Chartered’s banking-as-a-service (BaaS) offering.
“That, combined with the fact that [existing banking] technology is not quite up to scratch for serving scale … that’s where it becomes an interesting sweet spot for players like us,” Tan tells Tech in Asia.

Tan, who built and launched Nexus in 2018, says the conversation began around how Standared Chartered could drive a higher return on equity through a scalable business.
“The idea here was to become a platform for multiple front-end partners to plug in and turn themselves into digital banks,” he adds.
To do so, however, Standard Chartered needed to overhaul a legacy tech platform that wasn’t fit for purpose. It decided to make the platform – now Audax – available to third-party banks.
Today, Audax exists a standalone entity, having spun out of Standard Chartered – which remains its sole and majority shareholder – in August 2023.
So far, Standard Chartered Bank is its first and only client. However, Audax will make “a few announcements” about new clients later this year, Tan says.
Launching faster and cheaper
Tan says Audax’s “pre-built” solution can help banks offer digital account opening, deposit taking, card issuance, to lending and credit services “as-a-service” to their end-customers at a fraction of time and cost of doing so themselves.
The alternative – building their own solutions from scratch, or pulling together multiple vendors to do so – could take “two to three years,” Tan says.
Case in point: While digital banks in Singapore were awarded licenses in December 2020, the first digital full bank, GXS Bank, only launched its services in August 2022. Sea Group’s MariBank launched over two years later.
In comparison, Audax can get a new digibank up and running in “six to nine months,” he adds.

But it’s not the only firm seeing an increase in demand from nonbank entities wanting to offer banking services.
HugoHub, a fintech-as-a-service provider that soft-launched in the fourth quarter of 2023, says it’s seeing a “huge amount of demand” for its offering in Asia, says David Fergusson, CEO of HugoHub parent Atlas Consolidated.
The Singapore-headquartered firm operates Hugosave, a retail savings and investment product in Singapore. It also owns a stake in HugoBank, a digital bank in Pakistan slated to commence its pilot phase this May.
Atlas began planning to build its own infrastructure about two and a half years ago, Fergusson says.
While it relied on third-party BaaS firm Railsbank (now Railsr) to roll out retail products in its early days, it became clear that Railsr “wouldn’t be able to support [the company] across the region,” Fergusson shares.
This was due to concerns to “excessive claims” that Railsr had made about the breadth of their capability, the markets that they would be able to expand into, and the firm’s resource allocation to Asia, he explains.
Railsr, said to be valued at close to US$1 billion in 2021, was sold to a shareholder consortium in March 2023 as part of an insolvency process after being caught in financial and regulatory trouble.
HugoHub disaggregates parts of financial service system into modules such as deposits, payments, card issuance, credit, insurance, investing, forex, and trusts, Fergusson explains. It also provides ancilllary services such as loyalty programs, compliance, and analytics.
Its clients – both financial and nonfinancial institutions – can embed one, a few or all of these modules through HugoHub’s APIs. Meanwhile, HugoHub manages the ledgers or the records of account opening – i.e., the core banking systems – on behalf of these firms.

HugoHub currently has three enterprise clients “within the finance and investment services sectors,” though it’s seeing interest from partners in Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Switzerland, and the UK, Fergusson tells Tech in Asia.
These are B2C and B2B financial institutions that run the gamut of insurance, fund management, telecommunications, retail, brokerage, banks, and payments firms.
The complexity of running a multimarket, multiproduct company across Southeast Asia is what’s driving demand for HugoHub’s solution.
Fergusson says the region’s financial infrastructure, consumer touchpoints, and legal frameworks are “very heterogeneous” compared with “the United States or Europe.”
Most firms that are looking to launch different financial services in several markets within Southeast Asia would need to work with “two to four service providers,” require their own tech team, design their own front-end, and “manage four to five integrations themselves,” the CEO notes.
But by working with HugoHub, companies can get a single point of integration that’s more flexible and cost-effective, according to Fergusson.
Embedded finance 2.0
HugoHub’s offering is modular, which means its clients can build a single financial product or multiple ones – spanning savings, spending, and investments. Fergusson describes this as “like Lego,” referring to the popular brand of plastic building-block toys.
Because of its complexity, “only a limited number of firms” have the capabilities to do so, the CEO adds.

Indeed, many BaaS providers have tended to focus on a single vertical, such as payments or lending. However, this also limits them to just one function in the long run.
“Anytime you want to go beyond those use cases, it becomes very difficult,” Audax’s Tan notes. He pointed out that such firms realize they either don’t have the regulatory ability, experience, or tech capability to do so.
The advantage of being an “as-a-service” firm operating in a single vertical “will slowly be eroded” as banks catch up, he says. And when the banks do so, many single-vertical players will face challenges “in terms of their business economics.”
Tan suggests that the era of “middleman” BaaS players linking banks with ecosystem players may be running its course.
While BaaS firms like US-based Synapse had raised tens of millions of dollars by serving as intermediaries, it ultimately left itself dependent on a third-party bank partner’s balance sheet, licenses, and banking infrastructure.
That vulnerability was laid bare after clients of Synapse bypassed it to work directly with banks, leading to painful layoffs.
In the long run, this model might be difficult to sustain because it will push banks to evolve fast, according to Tan. But this is “a double-edged sword” as banks will then no longer need a middleman.
Then there are other issues, such as which firm does the onboarding, holds the data, and how that affects the backend.
Profitability game
For banks, there are substantial cost savings to be had.
The BaaS model reduces the cost of acquiring a new customer for digital banks from US$100 to about US$20, hence lowering their operating costs, Tan claims. The cost savings also apply to retail or SME banks.
“Net-net, you should expect that your return on equity should go up by a few percentage points because you’re far more efficient operating, and you’re servicing hopefully millions of clients at the same time,” he explains.
While Audax services just one client – its parent firm – at the moment, it is getting interest from banks in Southeast Asia and across the Middle East, particularly in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, Tan says.
The CEO confident that Audax can break even within the next five years on an EBIT basis.
As a Standard Chartered-backed firm, Audax has “cleared all the compliance and security requirements of a global bank,” giving it a “significant amount of credibility,” he adds.
However, Tan admits that using the tech developed for a rival bank remains a cause for concern from some of its “direct competitors.” To that end, Audax is seeking to raise funds from external investors “to a point whereby this is no longer a concern.”
Atlas, meanwhile, plans to apply for a number of banking licenses this year in the ASEAN, Africa, and the Middle East.
While the firm isn’t profitable yet, it’s expecting to break even on a net income basis on a group level this year.
“If we can get to 20 customers by the end of next year, we’ll be delighted because we’ll be a very profitable business at that point,” Fergusson says.","Using banking as a service, digital banks can lower the cost of acquiring a new customer from US$100 to US$20, tech provider Audax claims.",Melissa Goh,Editing by Simon Huang and Dhania Putri Sarahtika,open,0,"",https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1707825547_fi-out-with-the-middlemen-more-firms-tap-banks-baas-providers-for-embedded-finance.png,false,"",false,true,true,true,false,7,,1648,How banks look to take over fintech with embedded finance,"Using banking as a service, digital banks can lower the cost of acquiring a new customer from US$100 to US$20, tech provider Audax claims.",,,"","",""

Wish, the American ecommerce platform, was once seen as an online shopping powerhouse. Its parent firm ContextLogic raised US$1.1 billion in its 2020 IPO, giving it a market value then of US$14.1 billion.
However, as competition with the likes of Temu and Shein started to heat up, ContextLogic now announced it is selling its assets and liabilities to Singapore-based ecommerce firm Qoo10 for US$173 million – marking a huge discount to its previous valuation.
Wish is a US-based online marketplace founded in 2010. While it is known for offering low prices and a wide range of products, it has faced criticism for poor product quality, lengthy shipping times, and customer service issues.
It also saw a drastic drop in monthly active users over the past few years, with numbers falling from 90 million in 2021 to 27 million in 2022.
Priced at US$6.50 per share in cash, the deal still represents a premium of around 44% compared to ContextLogic’s closing stock price on February 9, the last trading day before the sale was announced.
This transaction follows a strategic review initiated in response to pressure from Cannell Capital and other activist investors, who cited concerns including persistent losses and declining market value.
ContextLogic will retain its identity after the deal, which is expected to be completed by mid-2024. However, the sale is still pending approval from ContextLogic’s shareholders, among other usual conditions.

Privy, an Indonesia-based digital authentication services firm, has acquired online tax platform AyoPajak for an undisclosed amount.
Founded in 2020, AyoPajak offers tax reporting for individuals and companies. It also provides tax consultancy directly supervised by the national tax authority, among other services.
Andreas Saryadi, CEO of AyoPajak, said that the collaboration between the two companies would help strengthen the tax platform’s offerings, with Privy already having government approval for digital tax certifications.
In addition, Privy will be able to integrate its electronic signature and identity verification services into the AyoPajak platform. In Indonesia, electronic signatures now have the same evidentiary power as physical signatures when issued by certified providers like Privy.
“We hope AyoPajak can become a market leader in the digital tax administration sector in Indonesia that guarantees the security and confidentiality of taxpayers’ personal data,” Marshall Pribadi, CEO of Privy, said in a statement.
Founded in 2016, Privy said that more than 3,000 companies have used its services, helping verify the digital identities of over 46 million users.
In November 2022, the company secured US$48 million in a series C round led by KKR. According to Tech in Asia’s database, Privy has raised a total of US$65.7 million in disclosed funding.

When it rains, it pours, and Byju’s is soaking in bad news.
Once India’s most valuable startup and an edtech trailblazer, the company has faced a turbulent last couple of years.
At its peak in March 2022, the firm was valued at US$22 billion. But in January, when it’s parent company Think and Learn announced that it would be seeking to raise US$200 million via a rights issue, the fundraise was valued at US$230 million, which would be a 99% plunge.
As the chart above shows, Byju’s witnessed a 44x rise in its valuation over a span of four years, only to see its value nosedive within about two years after it hit its peak.
The company’s rise to the top benefited from a pandemic-fueled boost in online learning. Its fall appears to have been sparked by a multitude of reasons.
It began in May 2022 when short-seller Fraser Perring put a short position on the edtech firm’s top investor Sofina Group, stating that Byju’s was “overvalued” and “unsound.”
Investors in the Indian company began to question its valuation, with both majority investor Prosus and minority investor Blackrock drastically marking down their stakes in the firm.
Byju’s also faced allegations that two of the investments that it received around the time it was valued at US$22 billion were fake.
What rocked investors’ faith in the firm even further was that its revenue growth for the financial year ending March 2021 – the reporting of which was delayed by over 18 months – was 40% lower than what the firm had projected. Losses had also widened significantly.
In June 2022, Byju’s laid off more than 2,500 employees to cut costs and also delayed its payments for the Aakash Education acquisition deal.
This month, the company’s backers called for a change in leadership, citing governance, financial mismanagement, and compliance issues at the company.
Think &amp; Learn has responded stating that the shareholder’s agreement does not give the investors the right to vote on CEO or management change. It said the proposed rights issue is on track and has received “encouraging responses from multiple investors.”
The heady days of a US$22 billion valuation must seem a long time ago for founder and CEO Byju Raveendran.

Indian edtech firm Eruditus is moving its headquarters from Singapore to India for its upcoming IPO, Reuters reported.
Ashwin Damera, CEO of Eruditus, said that the Indian stock markets offer “much liquidity and capital,” making an IPO there more attractive. However, he added that the potential listing is at least two years away.
The move highlights a change in strategy among Indian businesses, the report noted. Initially, companies preferred Singapore for easy access to capital. Now, they see the benefits of listing in their home country, including a thriving domestic market, better access to capital, and favorable regulatory situations.
Eruditus is reported to have hired accounting company EY to handle the shift. The edtech firm is also likely assessing potential acquisitions to bolster its talent pool.
To date, Eruditus has raised US$585 million in capital, with prominent backers like SoftBank, Accel, and Prosus. For the financial year ending June 2023, it saw its revenue spike by 75%, bringing its income to 33.2 billion rupees (US$400 million).

Reka, a California-based AI startup, appears to be ready to go head-to-head with the likes of Google and Microsoft. It has rolled out its latest multimodal and multilingual language model, Reka Flash.
The company was founded in 2022 by former researchers from Google DeepMind and Meta, including Yi Tay, a Singaporean who serves as Reka’s chief scientist. The new launch follows a US$58 million funding round in June 2023.
According to the firm, Reka Flash has 21 billion parameters. It said that the model is competitive with Google Bard’s Gemini Pro and OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 across different benchmarks.
Reka Flash has been trained on text from over 32 languages. According to Reka’s evaluations, it outperforms larger models like Llama 2, Grok-1, and GPT-3.5 in aspects such as reasoning, code generation, and question answering.
Additionally, the company released a more compact version of the model called Reka Edge. This variant, which has 7 billion parameters, is tailored for scenarios with limited resources, making it ideal for on-device or local applications.
Both Reka Flash and Reka Edge are currently available for beta testing. The company also said it is set to launch its largest model, Reka Core, in the coming weeks.

Hamish Daud, co-founder and CMO at Indonesian waste treatment startup Octopus, has stepped down from his position, citing “personal reasons.”
“I believe this company will get back on its feet and make a great environmental impact again soon,” Daud wrote on his personal Instagram account. He was associated with the startup for four years.
Founded by Daud, Moehammad Ichsan, Dimas Ario, and Niko Adi Nugroho in 2021, Octopus connects users to local waste collectors that will buy and pick up their post-consumer products, which include plastic and electronic waste.

Hello reader,
As a child, elections only meant one thing to me: a day off school.
I know now elections have more significance than that. Well, at least most do.
I come from Northern Ireland, where politicians can agree on so little that we’ve only had a functioning government for two of the past seven years. So whenever my home country elects its “leaders,” you can forgive my cynicism for wondering how much the outcome matters if those elected refuse to work together.
One upcoming election that certainly has a great deal of significance is Indonesia’s presidential poll. As today’s premium story dives into, the result will determine whether the new government carries on Joko Widodo’s legacy.
Those in the regional (and indeed global) tech and startup ecosystem are keenly watching to see if his digital economy-friendly policies will continue.
Today we look at:

What Indonesian presidential hopefuls plan to do for the tech industry
The key takeaways from Uber’s Q4 2023 results
Other newsy highlights such as Sea Group’s Singapore digibank reaching an AUM milestone and Thailand scrapping a tax on digital asset trading.


Premium summary
Indonesia goes to the polls

On February 14, millions of Indonesians will cast their vote for the country’s new president, and simultaneously shape the country’s tech future.
Indonesia’s digital economy was worth almost US$80 billion last year, and the policies of outgoing President Joko ‘Jokowi’ Widodo are widely credited for boosting it. But the candidates to replace him are divided on whether they should be continued.


TikTok divergence: Frontrunner Prabowo Subianto is firmly in the camp of carrying on Jokowi’s policies, including the ban on direct transactions on social media that was enforced last year. This ban sparked TikTok’s acquisition of local ecommerce player Tokopedia, and the election could also influence the partnership between the two companies. Other candidates – former Jakarta governor Anies Baswedan and former Central Java governor Ganjar Pranowo – would like to revisit the regulations to tackle the extremely cheap products being sold on TikTok Shop instead.

Electric feel: Jokowi pushed hard for electric vehicle adoption in the country, with policies such as purchase subsidies and tax incentives. The Subianto campaign spokesperson told Tech in Asia that he would continue the outgoing president’s policies, including completing the construction of Indonesia’s largest EV battery factory in Karawang, West Java. Pranowo’s campaign team, however, said he wanted the government to push foreign EV companies to share knowledge with domestic players.

In agreement: One thing all the candidates agree on is the need to make it easier for Indonesia to attract foreign investment. This would include streamlining regulations, offering tax breaks, and launching funding programs for startups. Dondi Hananto, a partner at the Singapore-based VC firm Patamar Capital, said that administrative hurdles in Indonesia have prompted many startups to prefer creating entities in Singapore.

Uber has released its earning results for the fourth quarter of 2023, which reveal a 15% revenue growth for the full year to US$9.9 billion.
Total trips on the ride-hailing platform grew 24% year over year.


Still growing: “Booking an Uber” is synonymous with using a ride-hailing platform, but the company’s user base still continues to expand. Monthly active users of the platform rose by 15% in 2023, alongside an increase in the total number of trips.

Margin call: The company’s adjusted EBITDA margin (as a percentage of gross bookings) hit a record of 3.4% in Q4 last year, indicating Uber is operating with more efficiency. 

Cash rules everything around me: The San Francisco-headquartered firm secured a net income of US$1.4 billion in the final quarter of 2023, a significant turnaround from its net loss of US$595 million in the same period in 2022.

The Indian astrology market is expected to reach US$25 billion by next year.
Astrotalk is one of the companies looking to capitalize on this growth. Founded in 2017 by Puneet Gupta and Anmol Jain, the spiritual tech startup connects consumers with over 15,000 astrologers for services such as horoscope reading, birth chart analysis, and virtual prayer.
The profitable startup has also raised US$20 million in a series A round from New York-based Left Lane Capital to fuel growth. Now it plans to hunt for strategic acquisitions to expand into international markets, develop new business verticals, and recruit senior leadership positions.
Astrotalk aims to tap into markets such as Canada, the Middle East, the UK, and the US.
The platform also claimed to record over 100% year-on-year revenue growth in the last three years and an annual recurring revenue of US$96 million in the financial year ending 2024.
“One-on-one consultations stand to be approximately 95% of our revenue with about 20% of the revenues coming from outside of India,” said Gupta, Astrotalk’s founder and CEO.
Earlier, Tech in Asia had reported that the startup was eyeing a US$40 million pre-IPO or growth round.

With rent prices surging globally, housing expenses remain a major problem for many students pursuing higher education.
However, there are some startups looking to help these students save a buck. They include Amber, a company that looks to remove broker fees and streamline the rental process.
Recently, the platform snagged US$21 million in a funding round led by Gaja Capital. This injection will power Amber’s global expansion, among other growth initiatives, it said.
Amber simplifies the housing hunt by providing verified listings, virtual tours, and expert guidance. Aiming to optimize operations, the firm also has an AI-powered dynamic pricing engine and a dashboard tool for property managers.
Established in 2017, the India-based startup has grown to have a footprint in Australia, Ireland, Canada, Germany, Spain, the UK, and the US. So far, Amber said it has attracted over 1 million monthly visitors to its website and mobile apps.
Lighthouse Canton and Stride Ventures also participated in the round, with The Rainmaker Group acting as the exclusive financial advisor.

Hello reader,
Profitability is elusive for startups and the situation is the same for ecommerce platforms.
In my home country India, ecommerce players have seen widening losses, including Flipkart, Myntra, and even Amazon’s (AMZN, NDAQ) India unit. A rare exception is SoftBank-backed Meesho, which turned profitable during the quarter ended September 2023.
Like India, Indonesia has its share of large ecommerce companies in pursuit of profitability. Blibli (BELI, IDX) is one such company. It might turn profitable this year as it saw a 30% improvement in EBITDA for the nine-month period ended September 2023.
In this week’s Big Story, my colleague Jofie explains how Blibli is carving its own niche in the fiercely competitive ecommerce sector in Indonesia.
Its relatively stable stock price since its market listing contrasts with that of Bukalapak (BUKA, IDX) and GoTo (GOTO, IDX), the other two ecommerce giants of Indonesia. Read on to know why Blibli is not your usual tech company.
— Samreen

THE BIG STORY

Why Blibli’s shares are outperforming GoTo, Bukalapak stocks
One advantage the company has is a reputation for stability, as most of its shares are held by conglomerate Djarum Group.

3 Trends to keep an eye on
Hot stocks, earnings reports, restructuring, pressure from activist investors, and more.

1️⃣ Better incentives in Lazada layoffs: Lazada and the Food, Drinks, and Allied Workers Union recently announced an enhanced support package and a training fund for those affected by the layoffs at the ecommerce company, which is owned by Alibaba (BABA, NYSE). This was brokered by Singapore’s Ministry of Manpower.
While it took Lazada over a month to come up with a revised support package, it underlines the importance of government intervention in cases of mass layoffs to support employees. It brings to the fore the appeal of Singapore’s tripartite model in which the government, companies, and employee unions come together to solve labor-related issues amicably.
2️⃣ Breaking out of non-compete claws: A Singapore judge has dismissed a lawsuit that Sea Group’s (SE, NYSE) Shopee made against Lim Teck Yong, a former senior employee, who had joined rival ByteDance after quitting the former.
Shopee alleged that Yong had breached a non-compete clause. However the court ruled that Shopee did not show “a serious question to be tried” on whether there was a violation of the clause.
This ruling in favor of the employee would be welcome to those who are looking to switch to rival companies but are burdened by non-compete clauses in their contracts.
3️⃣ Buyback on the front: In its December 2023 quarter results, Alibaba Group announced it is expanding its share repurchase plan by US$25 billion. Earlier last week, Meta (META, NDAQ) also announced to buy back an additional US$50 billion in shares and issue its first-ever quarterly dividend, signaling financial stability and confidence in future earnings. After posting its first annual operating profit, Uber, too, is reportedly mulling a share buyback.
While Meta managed to cheer investors with the news, leading to a 20% rally in its shares, Alibaba failed to do so. However, buybacks and even dividends are likely to become more commonplace among tech companies looking to attract investors in this era where money is no longer free.

The one you didn’t see coming
We spotlight the story that had everyone talking and social media buzzing during the past week.

Paytm’s existential crisis: India’s central bank has spooked Paytm (PAYTM, NSE). Last week, the Reserve Bank of India barred the fintech giant’s banking affiliate – Paytm Payments Bank (PPB) – from any activities. Non-compliance with know-your-customer norms as well as money-laundering concerns were said to be the the reasons. Many see this as a death sentence for the subsidiary.
Paytm said it is starting to accelerate its collaboration with other banks so that its services are not affected. However, the company’s shares crashed over 42% in the India market.
Paytm officials have now been holding meetings with the RBI and Finance Ministry to salvage the situation. But the banking unit reportedly may not survive the blow. This could have major ramifications on Paytm, leading to an estimated revenue loss of over 20% for the company’s lending business.

Iwan Kurniawan, co-founder of peer-to-peer lending platform Modalku, has left his role in the firm to “take a career break to explore my passions,” he wrote in a LinkedIn post.
He has been with Modalku for almost eight years, having helped the firm with its expansion in Indonesia and its entry into Thailand. Kurniawan said that during his time with the company, Modalku facilitated over US$3 billion in financing to more than 90,000 small businesses.
Kurniawan also sat at the board of Asosiasi FinTech Indonesia and currently acts as a fellow for Owl Ventures.
Modalku, which was founded in 2015 by Kurniawan, Kelvin Teo, and Reynold Wijaya, aims to provide access to affordable and reliable credit for small businesses, which are often overlooked by traditional financial institutions. The company runs under the Modalku name in Indonesia and under the Funding Societies brand in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.
In January, Funding Societies raised an undisclosed amount of capital from Khazanah Nasional and CGC Digital to aid its expansion in Malaysia.

Hi readers,
I’ve heard before that the best coffee is the one you make at home, and I tend to agree. But I also think the convenience of having a nice, warm (or iced) latte delivered at home or in the office can sometimes be a godsend.
That’s why even after buying an espresso machine and finding my go-to roaster, I still hop into my food delivery app to get my caffeine fix whenever I feel lazy or have somewhere to be. And this is where players like Fore Coffee and Kopi Kenangang come in.
During last year’s Tech in Asia Conference, the founders of both coffee chains said that there is still room to grow for coffee shops of any size.
Also, as the two firms expand to countries outside Indonesia, they must remember to leverage their  secret weapons: their home country’s coffee culture. For Fore Coffee in particular, among the most popular beverages on its launch day in Singapore was gula aren latte – an Indonesian blend that uses palm sugar to sweeten coffee.
Personally, I’ll be keeping an eye out for a potential launch here in the Philippines and lining up to have a taste of what Indonesia has to offer.

Amperesand, a Singapore-based electrical infrastructure company, has raised over US$12.4 million in seed funding. Xora Innovation, Temasek’s deeptech early-stage investment platform, co-led the round with venture capital firm Material Impact.
TDK Ventures, the venture arm of Japanese electronics firm TDK, also participated, along with Foothill Ventures.
Incubated at the Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Amperesand offers grid infrastructure solutions that can help improve EV charging hardware. Built on solid-state transformer (SST) technology, Amperesand’s system contains high-frequency transformers that are more efficient than traditional ones.
The firm has been aiming to commercialize its SST systems, which can be used for applications that have large power requirements. These include fast-charging solutions for electric vehicles, microgrids, and data centers.
The seed funding will enable Amperesand to industrialize and manufacture its technology at scale.
“The time for commercialization of SSTs is now,” said Phil Inagaki, managing director at Xora Innovation.
Founded by veterans from ABB, General Electric, Siemens, and Vestas, Amperesand began as an SST research and development program at NTU. While the company was established in 2023, the program started seven years ago.

Hello reader,
The other day, I had a meeting with someone who said he appreciates the basketball analogies I sometimes come up with in these opening blurbs. Just for you, dude, I’m going to try to do that again today.
Part of why I like the NBA is because it has a salary cap. The limit works as a leveler of sorts – even the teams located in the biggest markets, such as the Los Angeles Lakers and the New York Knicks, can’t just spend all the money they earn on players.
And if they choose to go over the cap – which they can – a “luxury tax” kicks in. Not even the richest team owners can countenance bleeding that kind of money for multiple years, so good players on expensive contracts are traded away and the talent distribution across teams becomes that little bit fairer.
If it’s not obvious, I have a personal fascination with the behind-the-scenes finances of organizations. And here comes the segue: I’m always interested to read about the finances of personal finance firms too. They’re supposed to be helping people save and make money, but they also have concerns themselves.
Today’s premium article focuses on investment platform Syfe’s latest numbers. It’s an interesting one, almost as fascinating as the NBA’s salary cap.
Today we look at:

A financial year of change for Syfe

Image credit: Timmy Loen

As I’ve written about in previous editions of the newsletter, 2023 was a year of massive change for me. That’s not to say it was bad, but it certainly had a lot more ups and downs than most years.
Financial year 2023 also sounds like it was a rollercoaster ride for Syfe, with highlights and lowlights alike.


Highlight: Syfe posted S$4.2 million (US$3.1 million) in group revenue for its most recent financial year (FYE 2023), which covers the period from April 2022 to March 2023. This marked an over 140% increase from the US$1.3 million recorded between January and December 2021.

Lowlights: However, its adjusted EBITDA loss widened by 27% to US$15.4 million within the same period, and it had to lay off around 10% of employees globally in February 2023 for “greater efficiency and adaptability to the rapidly evolving macroeconomic climate.”

An optimistic future: The company said it’s set to become profitable in Singapore by this year, with plans to attain group profitability – it has relatively nascent operations in Hong Kong and Australia – by 2025.

Tripling sales is a Simplus affair

Simplus, a direct-to-consumer home appliance brand, said it increased its sales threefold while becoming profitable in 2023.


Brief introduction: Founded in 2021 and headquartered in Thailand, Simplus is led by former Lazada Thailand CEO Jack Zhang. The company’s products include air fryers and vacuum cleaners, with  prices ranging from US$15 to US$50 per item.

Mr. Regional: The brand said it serves over one million customers across six countries in Southeast Asia, including Singapore and Indonesia.

Who wants to be a millionaire: Simplus said it ranked first on TikTok Shop and second on Shopee’s small home appliances category during last year’s 11.11 shopping festival. It reached a peak of US$1 million in sales in a single day, it added.

1️⃣ Safe acquisition
SentinelOne, a US cybersecurity firm listed on the New York Stock Exchange, has completed its acquisition of PingSafe, a Singapore-based cloud security startup.
TechCrunch reported last month that the acquisition valued PingSafe at over US$100 million.
2️⃣ Counting gas
East Ventures has teamed up with Kadin Indonesia – the country’s chamber of commerce and industry – as well as research firm WRI Indonesia to launch Ecovisea, a free global greenhouse gas calculator for businesses in Indonesia.
Ecovisea gauges emissions in three domains: emissions from company-owned sources, those from purchased energy, and indirect emissions from other parts of a company’s value chain. It uses emission factor information from Climatiq, a carbon calculation platform.
3️⃣ Will this fund be as hardy as a cactus?
India-based Cactus Venture Partners (CVP) has closed its first fund at over US$76 million, making it one of India’s largest first-time venture capital funds.
CVP has a primary interest in climate tech, healthtech, and B2B software-as-a-service companies, though it said it has a broad sector focus. The firm targets series A startups and those in the early series B stage.
4️⃣ Alibaba’s not-so-magical numbers
Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba Group increased its revenue by 5% year on year in the third quarter of FY 2024 to US$36.7 billion, slightly lower than what analysts estimated.
The company, whose financial year ends March 31, also generated US$7.4 billion in adjusted EBITDA – a 2% jump compared to the same period last year. However, income from operations decreased 36% year on year to US$3.2 billion.
5️⃣ Solving supply chain issues

SoftBank Group sold a major chunk of its stake in India’s Paytm just before the central bank imposed sanctions that sent firm’s share price tumbling by over 42% within three days. Bloomberg reported the development, citing Navneet Govil, the Vision Fund’s executive managing partner and CFO.
According to Govil, SoftBank had sensed concerns about the increasing uncertainty in India’s regulatory landscape as well as the license status of Paytm Payments Bank – the fintech firm’s banking affiliate.
SoftBank’s stake in Paytm had gone down from 18.5% in November 2021, when the fintech firm was listed in India, to nearly 5% in January. It is unclear what SoftBank’s plans are with the remaining shares.
Paytm has landed in hot water since the Reserve Bank of India froze most of its banking operations on January 31, forcing users to switch to rival platforms. Downloads of rival apps like PhonePe and Google Pay reportedly had double-digit growth, while Paytm saw a 32% drop in the first week of February compared with the last week of January.
After a less-than-stellar performance over the past year, SoftBank reversed its fortunes in the December quarter, posting a net income of US$6.3 billion.

836614,2024-02-09T07:00:00,2024-02-08T10:03:21,"Why Blibli’s shares are outperforming GoTo, Bukalapak stocks",bliblis-shares-outperforming-goto-bukalapak,publish,post,https://www.techinasia.com/bliblis-shares-outperforming-goto-bukalapak,"Among all the major ecommerce platforms in Indonesia, Blibli has the lowest market share, according to Momentum Works.
For the nine months ending in September 2023, the company underperformed its listed peers, namely Bukalapak and GoTo’s ecommerce unit, Tokopedia.
﻿﻿
Yet, in 2023, Blibli’s shares on the Indonesia Stock Exchange increased by around 2.6%. While not significant, it still performed better than GoTo and Bukalapak, which declined by 8% and 18%, respectively.
Investor sentiment toward the company may seem surprisingly positive, but there are good reasons for this, and not all of them may be related to the substance of its business.
Not your usual tech company
The value of Blibli’s stock has remained relatively stable since its initial public offering at 450 rupiah (US$0.028) per share. In contrast, the stock prices of GoTo and Bukalapak have seen greater fluctuations.

Unlike its competitors, Blibli focuses on its niche in the electronics category and also provides customers with both an online and offline experience.
Andre Benas, head of research at BCA Sekuritas, explains that there is a distinct contrast between Blibli and the other two companies, as Blibli’s stocks are primarily owned by its parent company Djarum Group.
Indeed, a majority of Blibli’s shares – 83% – are held by the conglomerate through PT Global Investama Andalan, according to its latest financial statements. In comparison, GoTo and Bukalapak only have 29% and 49% insider ownership, respectively.
Analyst Devi Harjoto from KB Valbury Sekuritas adds that the Djarum association gives Blibli a stable reputation among the public. This is particularly since the conglomerates’ owners, the Hartono brothers, are the wealthiest individuals in Indonesia, with an estimated US$48 billion fortune.
He also notes that Blibli’s expansion last year was mostly oriented toward monetization, not just “for the sake of growth.” Throughout 2023, the company was more focused on allocating spending for expanding offline stores and its logistics capacity.

At the end of 2023, Blibli had a total of 166 physical stores, including consumer electronics shops scattered across malls throughout Indonesia as well as branches of the supermarket chain Ranch Market, which it acquired in 2021.
It also started the construction of its largest warehouse, covering an area of 100,000 square meters in Marunda, West Java, in May 2023. The warehouse will handle fulfillment for 40% to 50% of all Blibli warehouse orders and is targeted to start operating this year.
However, Christopher Rusli from Mirae Asset Sekuritas Indonesia believes that the performance of Blibli’s shares does not reflect the company’s underlying fundamentals in 2023. He says that the decline in GoTo’s and Bukalapak’s shares more accurately reflects the state of the tech sector in the country last year.
“In 2023, globally we are in a period of economic uncertainty, so it still makes sense that GoTo and Bukalapak performance was not good in that year,” explains the analyst. He adds that Blibli’s minimal stock movement is also due to its relatively small transaction volume.

Travel is crucial
Like other tech companies that have gone public, Blibli is currently focused on pursuing profitability.
Based on its earnings report for the nine-month period ending in September 2023, the company recorded several improvements, such as a 35% increase in total processing value and a 9% uptick in net revenue.
The company’s EBITDA also improved by 30% during that period, with Benas of BCA Sekuritas predicting that the firm may achieve positive EBITDA by the end of 2024. Additionally, its loss narrowed in that timeframe.

The company’s marketplace and the online travel agent (OTA) platform Tiket, which merged with Blibli in 2022, contributed most of the firm’s revenue.
Benas says that the inclusion of Tiket in Blibli’s ecosystem plays a crucial role in the company’s profitability. He even sees Tiket having a larger contribution because the value in OTA products are larger compared to those in the consumer goods segment.
“Traveling has become a luxury need every year, so I think its growth will remain good in the future,” says Benas, noting that Tiket holds the second-largest market share for OTAs in Indonesia after Traveloka.
“Once Indonesia’s GDP per capita improves significantly, Tiket will be able to reap the benefits in the long term,” he adds.
KB Valbury Sekuritas’ Harjoto also believes that the take rate for travel is “definitely larger” compared to ecommerce when looking at peer travel startups. Competition in the OTA sector is not as intense as in ecommerce as well.
To achieve profitability, a spokesperson for Blibli tells Tech in Asia that the company is currently focused on strategies to “increase margins, cost efficiency, and strengthen synergies within the Blibli, Tiket, and Ranch Market ecosystem.”
Tech stocks in 2024
Blibli’s superior stock performance seems to be carrying forward into 2024. As of February 7, its share price has declined by 0.4% year to date, while GoTo’s dropped by 3.5%, and Bukalapak experienced a 14.9% fall.
According to Mirae Asset’s Rusli, domestic and global economic conditions will determine the performance of tech stocks in the country, especially influenced by interest rates. He adds that the US Fed has the potential to cut rates this year, providing an opportunity for the prices of tech stocks to rise.

Profitability will no doubt remain a big concern for investors as well.
For Blibli itself, this year will be a test to achieve profitability and prove that its omnichannel strategy can contribute significantly to the company. Harjoto says that its physical stores bring higher margins and can help the company achieve profitability.
On the other hand, if Djarum were to divest its ownership in Blibli, this might have a significant negative impact on the company’s stock performance. That said, Djarum has indicated that it does not have the intention to exit.
Benas believes that Blibli will continue its strategy of measured spending and focus on its niche.
“I think Blibli is quite happy with its position now,” he says.

Grab and GoTo Group have reopened merger talks four years after their initial talks, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
The sources said that Grab and GoTo are in preliminary discussions on a variety of options. One possible scenario is for Grab to acquire GoTo using cash, stocks, or both.
According to one source, GoTo has been more open toward the possibility of a merger after Patrick Walujo’s appointment as CEO last year.
The merger would have far-reaching effects on Southeast Asia’s ride-hailing and food delivery spaces. Both companies may hope to stem their ongoing losses amid their long-running rivalry.
In late 2020, both companies reportedly agreed on several parts of the potential deal. However, Gojek eventually chose to merge with ecommerce unicorn Tokopedia and went public as GoTo Group.
Tokopedia, however, has since merged with TikTok parent ByteDance, marking TikTok Shop’s return to Indonesia.
Meanwhile, Grab is reportedly in talks to acquire food delivery platform Foodpanda. Should the deal go through, it would make Grab Southeast Asia’s undisputed food delivery leader.

Only days after leading a US$100 million funding in HashKey Group, OKX Ventures invested in Bitmap Tech to accelerate growth in the bitcoin ecosystem.
The deal size was undisclosed.
Bitmap Tech is the company behind Merlin Chain, a native bitcoin Layer 2 (L2) that runs on top of the main blockchain, mainly to facilitate faster transactions. Akin to an upgraded version of the digital currency, Merlin Chain empowers bitcoin’s native assets, protocols, and products on Layer 1 through its L2 network.
“We have high expectations for Bitmap Tech to integrate more original and comprehensive bitcoin services,” said Dora Yue, founder of OKX Ventures.
Bitmap Tech will use the fresh funds to “further enrich the bitcoin ecosystem and enhance overall liquidity,” according to a statement.
OKX Ventures, which has an initial capital commitment of US$100 million, is the investment arm of global crypto exchange OKX. Some of its recents bets include Omega, Renzo, and DexTools.

Throughout his long career as an angel investor and venture capitalist, Khailee Ng has had numerous conversations with founders eager to scale their businesses and make an impact. Building a business, however, is not just about pursuing growth; it also comes with tough realities such as funding struggles and operational challenges.
That’s part and parcel of the startup journey, Ng shared in his keynote speech at the Tech in Asia Conference held in October 2023. These challenges are already hard enough, but the constant griping and gossip-mongering about Southeast Asian startups makes things even more difficult.
“I’m inviting you to not badmouth or spread rumors about various companies. And it’s not even [just] about the public companies, it’s about series B and C companies as well,” said Ng, who is managing partner at VC firm 500 Global.
“And why do you want to bitch about them? […] I’m sure everyone’s going through a hard time,” he added.
Instead of succumbing to gossip and negativity, the startup community should embrace a mindset of positivity and encouragement, creating an environment where founders can thrive and learn from each other, Ng explained.
However, he pointed out that cheerleading goes beyond just celebrating successes. It should also involve fostering a culture of support, collaboration, and resilience.
Going through a phase
Southeast Asia has evolved from its early days, when everything seemed fantastic, to a period that Ng likens to a teenage growth spurt.
“You want to be cool, do the cool thing,” he said. “Startups became so cool, but now we’re getting schooled. Now we’re getting some harsh lessons.”
But as the title of his keynote – Southeast Asia at the Crossroads – suggests, the region’s tech landscape is maturing out of its teenage years. And with this transition, stakeholders must take a broader and more strategic view of the challenges and opportunities ahead.
One area that needs attention is the funding landscape, Ng stressed. Many founders struggle to secure funding, and the process can be daunting and time-consuming.
It is also crucial to focus on growth and sustainability. Many founders grapple with the pressure to scale quickly but without compromising on profitability.
This point hits close to home for eFishery CEO and founder Gibran Huzaifah, whose company is part of 500 Global’s investment portfolio. According to Ng, Huzaifah is dead set on not crossing into the red after growing his aquaculture tech firm from US$10 million in 2019 to US$372 million in 2022.
See also: EFishery takes on global aquaculture in a balancing act
Another teenager-like trait is following ‌trends. Ng shares that instead of mimicking successful companies, startups should focus on finding its inner voice and charting a unique path to growth while being relentless about its goals.
“If you’re completely relentless, you’re going to create new options,” he said. “That relentlessness defines you as a venture investor helping companies or as a founder.”
One example is Bukalapak, which Ng sees as the scrappy underdog of Indonesia’s ecommerce landscape that just won’t give up. 500 Global had invested in Bukalapak not long before rival Tokopedia raised US$100 million. At the time, it was the largest round for an Indonesian startup on public record.
“Bukalapak almost always had 10x less money than anybody else,” he noted. But he also stressed that the company knows how to fight and ultimately became the first among Indonesia’s unicorns to go public.
Beyond SEA
Resources for startups in Southeast Asia may still be limited compared to what’s available in more developed ecosystems. For Ng, that underlines the importance of a growth hacking and cost-efficiency mindset. In other words, it is essential to find low-cost, high-result initiatives that can drive growth without unnecessary expenditure.
However, Ng also encouraged founders to look beyond Southeast Asia, as other emerging economies with comparable traits are on the rise. Again, though, startups must be strategic when considering each market’s distinctive dynamics.
One startup that’s currently on that journey is eFishery. In October 2023, the firm announced its expansion into India – one of the many options for growth outside Southeast Asia.
“Depending on your business model, you don’t have to expand into the Philippines or Vietnam. You can if you want to, but there [is also] Bangladesh, Pakistan,” Ng said. “There are greener pastures beyond Southeast Asia for your business model. You just have to go out and find it.”","The region’s startup scene is also maturing, transitioning from its “teenage years” of following trends and wanting to be cool, investor Khailee Ng says.",Miguel Cordon,Editing by Putra Muskita and Eileen C.

The SoftBank Vision Fund has posted a gain of US$3.6 billion during the December quarter, after being in the red in the first half of 2023.
Of this amount, Vision Fund 1 made US$1.9 billion, while Vision Fund 2 posted a gain of US$1.7 billion. In total, both funds sold investments worth US$19.5 billion in the period, including full exits from 13 portfolio companies.
One of the exits is through Chip designer Arm, which went public in 2023. Arm recorded US$2.1 billion in net sales for the nine-month period ending December 2023, a 13% year-on-year rise.
Driven by these numbers, Vision Fund parent firm SoftBank Group reported a net income of US$6.3 billion during the December quarter, a turnaround from the US$5.2 billion loss during the same period in 2022. The company’s financial year ends on March 31.
While Vision Fund 1 has investments in companies such as ByteDance, DiDi, GoTo, and Grab, Vision Fund 2 has made bets on Carro, Cars24, and Flipkart.
Apart from Arm’s listing, another highlight of the quarter was SoftBank’s receipt of 48.8 million T-Mobile US shares in December. The windfall, which came at no additional cost, happened following T-Mobile US’ merger with SoftBank-owned telco Sprint.
SoftBank also made a shift in its strategy, focusing on an AI-centric portfolio after selling most of its stake in Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba.
Amid the bullish results, SoftBank’s share price rose by 11% to 7,350 yen (US$49.41) in Tokyo.

Southeast Asia’s ecommerce competition is getting fiercer following Temu’s entry and TikTok Shop’s growing presence, and Lazada is feeling the heat. The platform, once the regional leader, laid off up to 30% of its employees across all of its markets right after the new year started.
Parent company Alibaba Group, however, remains optimistic. It sees Southeast Asia as “a very important market” and believes there is still “significant potential” for Lazada to deepen its penetration in the region.
“Our approach is to continue to balance efficiency against growth, to continue to work to narrow the losses in the business while maintaining growth,” said Jiang Fan, CEO of Alibaba International Digital Commerce (AIDC), in the group’s latest earnings call. AIDC oversees platforms such as Lazada, AliExpress, Daraz, and Trendyol.
The CEO emphasized that the Chinese ecommerce giant will continue to make investments in Lazada at an “appropriate scale.” Alibaba last injected additional capital into Lazada in December 2023, to the tune of US$634 million.
During the quarter ending in December 2023, Lazada’s loss per order narrowed year over year, according to the company. Fan or other executives did not further discuss Lazada’s growth in the call. However, Alibaba stated in its financial report that Lazada will continue increasing monetization and decreasing logistics costs.
Alibaba’s international ecommerce business has had an eventful start of 2024. Aside from Lazada’s layoffs, Pakistan-headquartered Daraz – which Alibaba acquired in 2018 – recently announced some changes.
Daraz, which also operates in three other South Asian countries, announced in late January that its founder and CEO Bjarke Mikkelsen would step down. Lazada group CEO James Dong will take Mikkelsen’s place as acting CEO.
AIDC’s revenue did grow 44% year on year in the latest quarter. Toby Xu, Alibaba’s CFO, said during the earnings call that the increase was primarily due to solid revenue growth from AliExpress, especially in the Choice business and Trendyol.
In addition, total orders from AIDC platforms also jumped by 24% year on year, driven by strong growth in the cross-border business. CEO Fan added that AliExpress posted an order growth of over 60% during the period.

Hello reader,
About a decade ago, I watched this film called In Time starring Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried.
The premise of the movie was really interesting because it’s set in a world where after a person reaches 25 years old, the duration they have left to live becomes commoditized. That means that your remaining time can be bought, sold, or traded.
Naturally, wealthier people could live much longer, possibly up to hundreds of years or even forever. Meanwhile, the less fortunate had to do whatever they could to survive just one more day.
While the film wasn’t executed that well, I’ve always thought that the concept was a good way to try and discuss class differences, just with much higher stakes.
One of the main plot points in the film was how it was clear that the time-rich of that society were oppressing the lower class, and that they had implemented systems to keep things that way.
How is this related to today’s story? It was all in the name, so don’t feel too disappointed thinking there was a startup that could commoditize time.
Rather, the digital bank in question, TymeBank, has a name that’s relevant to the movie’s plot, and that’s how I got thinking about it. Let’s take a look at how it’s faring in the Philippines and Vietnam.
Today we look at:

Tyme Group’s path to victory  
Cred’s acquisition of wealth management firm Kuvera
Other newsy highlights such as Midjourney’s new head of hardware and River’s US$40 million series B round.

Clocking Tyme Group’s strategy

Tyme Group

I’ve never used a digital bank before, but that’s mostly just because I’ve never had a reason to. Some of the ones in Singapore do offer great deals on new accounts, but they are usually snapped up faster than you can say “interest rates.”
However, Tyme Group’s strategy to onboard customers takes things one step further beyond simple promotions.


Go where the people are: In the Philippines, the startup operates as GoTyme Bank, a joint venture with Gokongwei Group. To reach people with limited digital access, GoTyme Bank uses kiosks located in partner retail stores to acquire customers. 

Sharing is caring: Because it’s dealing with people’s money, gaining their trust is key. To do so, Tyme Group partners with reputable retail brands such as Robinsons Retail and Daiso in the Philippines. 

It’s about tyme: Tyme Group is planning to enter Vietnam later this year, where it will offer both SME lending and retail banking services.

Gaining wealth management cred

Indian fintech giant Cred is extending its tendrils into digital wealth management, following a deal to acquire Kuvera. Just by Kuvera’s numbers alone, this seems like a great opportunity – let’s take a closer look.


A big pie: Kuvera says it has over 300,000 clients and more than US$6 billion in assets under management. 

Do your thing: The Kuvera team will still operate autonomously after the acquisition, and the company’s services will continue as usual.  

Whole new worlds: This is just one of Cred’s efforts to expand its offerings. Last year, it rolled out a buy now, pay later solution called Cred Flash.

The Singapore-based ecommerce major’s case against Lim Teck Yong was dismissed by a judge in the city-state last week.

Image credit: Timmy Loen

The company sued Lim, who was executive director of operations position at Shopee Brazil, for joining ByteDance in 2023 – a move that allegedly breached noncompetition and nonsolicitation restrictions in his employment contract. Shopee sought injunctions to stop Lim from working for the Chinese tech giant and to prevent him from soliciting Shopee clients and employees.
Since the judgment on lawsuit was handed down, Singapore’s Manpower Minister Tan See Leng announced that legal guidelines on restraint of trade clauses should be finalized in the second half of this year.
Tech in Asia spoke to experts from the human resources, public relations, and legal fields to get their reactions to the case. Their replies were edited for clarity and length.

Without getting into the specifics of this case, I’ll say I’m not a fan of noncompetition clauses. They’re the corporate world’s version of “If I can’t have you, no one can.”
They present a smorgasbord of legal, ethical, and hair-pulling complexities for everyone involved.
Why do companies include these clauses? One reason companies give is that they’re pumping valuable resources into training employees.
By resources, they mean two-hour seminars on how to leverage synergistic paradigms to streamline workflow. In layman’s terms, that means how to make pointless meetings shorter by talking faster.
Then there’s also the idea that an employee who leaves will take “trade secrets” with them and cause harm to the firm. This is often pretty far-fetched and highlights the fantasy that these companies have something worth stealing – most don’t.
As for the ethics of noncompete clauses, I think it’s pretty simple. When you limit where someone can work after they quit your company, you’re not just tampering with their LinkedIn profile; you’re manipulating the very DNA of social mobility.
To be clear, I do think there is a place for noncompetition clauses. They just need to exist on fairer legal terms and have strong legal basis. Putting them in contracts purely as a scare tactic isn’t the solution.
There is a need to highlight that the malice aspect of an employee’s behavior is addressed by existing laws. In addition, companies can use the garden leave concept if they don’t want someone to have active knowledge.
If a company is developing the next amazing galactic innovation for NASA and there’s a competitor, then it makes sense to limit that knowledge transfer. But we already have things around patent law to cover that.
However, companies are using noncompetion clauses for sales or marketing people who are two years out of university. It doesn’t make sense.

Cho Pei Lin is a former litigation lawyer who now does litigation PR within her crisis communications practice.
When Shopee commenced the suit against its former employee, the company must have sought legal advice but did not think much about the impact of a litigation matter on its reputation and brand.
Shopee is not the only company that acts like this.
At the start of a litigation process, most organizations focus only on wanting to enforce their rights under the law. At best, Shopee must have thought the case would have little impact on the public. But it has been proven wrong – not just in the courtroom but in the court of public opinion as well.
CNA’s LinkedIn post on the story has attracted 181 reactions, 16 reposts, and 13 comments. Its Telegram post got 707 reactions and has more than 72,000 views
(At the time of publishing, the LinkedIn post had 270 reactions, 22 reposts, and 16 comments while the Telegram post had 745 reactions and more than 106,000 views).
In these posts, many people viewed Shopee as a bully and applauded the judgment.
Generally, big corporate organizations that sue individuals will be in a David vs. Goliath situation, and they need to carefully manage communications with key stakeholders to ensure the correct narrative is communicated. When matters are before the court, it is necessary to align communication objectives with the legal team as media often quote directly from the judgment, legal submissions, and/or what was said in open court.

In Shopee Singapore vs. Lim Teck Yong, the High Court was asked to grant an interim injunction restraining the defendant from soliciting Shopee’s clients and employees, and in the alternative, from working with any of Shopee’s competitors.
In such cases, a court would have to consider a variety of factors.
Firstly, the court considers whether there is a “serious question to be tried.” After extensive analysis of the arguments and evidence presented to it, the court found that Shopee had failed to do so. The judge said the company’s “prospects of success are so small that they lack substance and reality.” Ouch.
Another factor that a court examines is something called the “balance of convenience.” This means that the court will take whichever course appears to carry the lower risk of injustice, should that course turn out to be ultimately “wrong.”
Where the balance of convenience is even, a court will also then not disturb the current status quo. In this case, the status quo is that Lim, the defendant, had already started work with his new employers.
The court further held that even if there were serious questions to be tried, it would not have granted the interim injunction sought in this case on the balance of convenience.
The results of this judgment once again demonstrate the difficulties in enforcing restrictive covenants in Singapore. However, I am sure employers will continue to have such clauses in their employment contracts.","We spoke to professionals from the HR, PR, and legal fields for their take on Shopee’s attempt to enforce a noncompete agreement.",Peter Cowan,Editing by Terence Lee and Eileen C.

Hi there,
Everyone likes a free lunch. My poison is airline miles – I’ll buy vouchers to dine at a restaurant just to earn nine miles per dollar from Kris+, the lifestyle rewards app run by Singapore Airlines.
Others may use apps like ShopBack to earn cashback on their purchases and other rewards.
Singapore-based ShopBack also sells vouchers that people can use to make purchases. In its most recent financial year ended March 2023 (FYE 2023), revenue from selling these vouchers accounted for 41% of the company’s overall figure, the second biggest item after revenue from commissions.
As my colleague Samreen explores in this week’s big story, selling such vouchers remains a “significant and growing” part of ShopBack’s business in selected markets. However, the company is also trying to break into new businesses, such as buy now, pay later (BNPL).
Yet, these initiatives come with risks. ShopBack cited an impairment of goodwill arising from the acquisition of BNPL startup Hoolah as one of the reasons for its widening losses in FYE 2023.
We all like a free lunch, although someone always ends up footing the bill.
— Simon

THE HOT TAKE
Sea you in court

The Supreme Court of Singapore (left) and the Old Supreme Court building / Photo credit: Socksiong / Wikimedia Commons

Here’s what happened:

A lawsuit filed by Shopee against a former senior employee, Lim Teck Yong, who joined ByteDance was dismissed last week
The ecommerce giant alleged that Lim’s move to a competitor violated terms in his employment contract
A Singapore judge found that Shopee failed to show there was a breach of non-competition and non-solicitation restrictions

Here’s our take:
Most of us wouldn’t think too much about the repercussions of leaving an employer to join another company. However, when you’re a senior employee leaving the firm to join a competitor, there may be consequences.
Shopee took Lim to court for joining ByteDance, the parent firm of TikTok, alleging that he was breaching the terms of his employment contract. It even tried to obtain an injunction to prevent him from joining any Shopee competitor.
Lim had been with Shopee for eight years.
However, Justice Kwek Mean Luck dismissed the lawsuit, questioning whether Shopee had a “legitimate proprietary interest” to project and how reasonable it would be to apply a restraint that would prevent Lim from seeking employment in all markets Shopee operates in.
This is the dirty secret of clauses in employment contracts that seek to restrain employees from joining a competitor – they’re often seen as unreasonable and so will not be enforced, even if the parties agreed to them.
Tech companies are likely to continue inserting such terms into their agreements. After all, competition in the industry is cutthroat, and tapping into the expertise of former employees is a good way to get ahead of the competition.
In light of the judgment, tech employers may want to consider imposing more specific restrictions in their employment contracts. For example, instead of prohibiting an employee from working for a competitor in any market the company operates in, the restriction can be for a specific market. In Lim’s case, that might have been Brazil, where he served as executive director of operations for Shopee.
While it isn’t clear whether Lim’s contract specified a time limit, having a reasonable one for these clauses – six months, for instance – may also make them more likely to pass muster with the courts.
Ultimately, enforceability aside, much of this boils down to deterrence. Having such a clause may discourage employees from breaching the terms, even if they prove to be unenforceable. Many who are not legally trained may not even be aware of the likely unenforceability of such clauses.
Even if they are, they may be unwilling to deal with the hassle, expenses, and uncertainty of a lawsuit.
Finally, Lim will now have to be extra careful in how he interacts with his former company and colleagues. While Justice Kwek found that there was no proof Lim was about to breach the non-solicitation restrictions, Shopee may act if this changes.
By moving aggressively now, Shopee may have been hoping to shape Lim’s future conduct, even if it knew it would lose the battle.
All is fair in love, war, and, we suppose, business.

Thailand has announced new regulations exempting value-added tax (VAT) on all digital asset trading as it aims to become a regional hub for such products. The exemption has been in effect since January 1, 2024 with no expiration date, according to the country’s Finance Ministry.
Previously, crypto and digital token trading activities were subject to a 7% VAT. The latest development also adds to an existing policy exempting VAT for crypto transfers to a third party, which came into effect last May.
Thailand is undergoing a transition in crypto-friendly regulations. Last month, the country’s Securities and Exchange Commission lifted the 300,000 baht (around US$8,400) investment cap for retail investors in digital tokens backed by real estate or infrastructure.
Finance Minister’s Secretary Paopoom Rojanasakul stated that the government aims to promote digital assets as a new alternative for fundraising and to boost the country’s digital economy, according to The Bangkok Post.

MariBank, Sea Group’s Singapore-based digibank subsidiary, has crossed S$200 million (US$149 million) in assets under management (AUM) for Mari Invest, its investment account offering.
Mari Invest lets customers access investment products like the Lion-MariBank SavePlus Fund, which comprises of MAS Bills and bond funds. That product is managed by Lion Global Investors – a Great Eastern subsidiary and a member of OCBC Group – and is distributed exclusively through Mari Invest.
The AUM refers to the total market value of investments under the Lion-MariBank SavePlus Fund.
“Our customers resonate with Mari Invest’s simplicity and transparency, especially how it lowers traditional barriers to investing,” the digibank said in a LinkedIn post. “This includes the ease of withdrawal that Mari Invest provides.”
Over one-third of MariBank’s savings account holders have tried out Mari Invest, the bank added.
MariBank, which launched its services in March last year on an invite-only basis, is Singapore’s third digital-native bank. It offers personal savings accounts, business accounts, and business loan products.
Last July, parent Sea Group – which also operates SeaBank in Indonesia – injected US$172.5 million into MariBank.

After we released a summary of the reviews we’ve received so far, Glasswall became the talk of Southeast Asia’s startup community.

Image credit: Tech in Asia

Over 250 reviews were submitted, most of them within the past week. While a good chunk of them are critical, most VCs got an overall positive rating. This is great – we’ve always wanted Glasswall to highlight both sides of the coin.
Glasswall taps into something raw and real: There’s been years and years of pent-up desire among founders to talk about VCs. But even some investors are excited about this. “Can I just say, bravo with Glasswall? It’s so beautiful,” a VC told me.
Positive feedback before launch
The idea of a “Glassdoor focused on VCs” isn’t new. Perhaps the most successful one is Bookface, a platform exclusively for startups that have joined US-based accelerator Y Combinator.
But none of these platforms has a foothold in Southeast Asia. So somewhere around the first half of 2023, the Tech in Asia team thought, why don’t we build one?
Our first step was to gather feedback. We put ourselves in the shoes of startup founders to understand what they’re going through when fundraising.
While it’s obvious that founders often turn to each other for advice, we found out that they’re often exchanging notes on investors: who’s in the market for an investment and who’s not, what their tendencies are, and whether they’re great to work with.
But these chats usually happen in whispers and in private WhatsApp groups since VCs wield a lot of power. This means founders don’t want to say anything critical out loud. It also creates information asymmetry, allowing some VCs to get away with bad behavior.
The chats with founders made us more confident that we were on the right track. Then it was up to people in the product and engineering team – Willis, Christine, and Liang Jie specifically – to bring Glasswall to life. Most of the credit should go to them.
How it works and what comes next
Leaving a review on Glasswall is easy. Start by heading to the Investors section of our Database and search for the name of the investor. Hit “Write a review” to leave your comments.
Your privacy is assured – you don’t need a Tech in Asia account to leave feedback.

Of course, we know that anonymous reviews come with a host of issues. Indeed, some investors I spoke to are less warm to the idea.
One VC told me that some founders take things personally after getting rejected. As such, they might leave a bad review even though the investor had been transparent and communicative.
On the flip side, quite a few VCs tell me they like Glasswall because it creates more transparency in the industry.
After all, they’ve been burned by bad behavior from peers who own shares in the same startup. One investor told me that they maintain a blacklist of VCs they’d never work with.
Another consideration is how despite its anonymous content and fake reviews, Glassdoor still gives people a real pulse on an employer. The same goes for Glasswall – as long as founders do their own checks on investors, that is.
In any case, crowdsourced reviews isn’t a new idea. There are many tried-and-true ways to mitigate the downsides, and we’ll prioritize these to keep the momentum going and encourage quality reviews.
For starters, we’ll moderate reviews based on guidelines that we’ll create. We’re also considering allowing investors to flag or reply to feedback. In addition, we’re looking into giving people the option to leave comments tied to their registered accounts.
Our goal is for Glasswall to be a place for constructive and honest feedback. It’s a tricky balance: Founders want a safe space to voice out issues, but investors are worried about malicious falsehoods. Both are valid concerns.
Navigating this deftly will be key to Glasswall’s success. I can’t speak for the rest of the team, but I’m both scared and excited by what we’ve released.

836344,2024-02-08T05:56:29,2024-02-08T23:39:19,This 22-year-old turns Notion templates into a thriving business,notion-templates-thriving-business,publish,post,https://www.techinasia.com/notion-templates-thriving-business,"In March 2023, an X (formerly known as Twitter) user by the name of Easlo posted something intriguing: “I’m halfway there to my first US$1 million revenue.” It was noteworthy because all Easlo does is sell a single type of digital product: templates for Notion, a productivity app.
Easlo is the moniker of 22-year-old Singaporean Jason Chin. As Easlo, he has a huge social media following: 314,000 followers on X, 390,000 on Instagram, and 412,200 on TikTok, to name a few.

Every day, aside from selling Notion templates to help businesses and individuals plan their activities, he posts productivity hacks. The visual posts are in his trademark black and white and show his affinity for minimalism.
Chin is one of many riding the no-code wave, where users can build and launch software without learning any coding. He is also one of many internet evangelists espousing the “solopreneur” lifestyle.
Solopreneur is the term given to individuals running a one-man business. Most of them derive earnings from the internet, with activities ranging from writing newsletters to offering courses.

Among the biggest proponents of this lifestyle are former Amazon product engineer Daniel Vassallo and writer Justin Welsh.
But is the life of creating Notion templates too good to be true and as straightforward as it seems?
“Over six figures”
Without diving into specifics, Chin tells Tech in Asia that his yearly earnings have continued to grow over the past three years. His earnings in 2022 and 2023 were each “over six figures” in US dollars, a comfortable sum even in his home country.

A screengrab of Easlo’s Second Brain template on Gumroad / Photo credit: Easlo’s Gumroad page

A snapshot of Chin’s earnings can be found on his Gumroad page. For instance, his Second Brain template netted 5,652 sales for the years 2022 and 2023. A conservative estimate would already see him earning around US$400,000 on that product alone.
Chin tells us that this figure does not include 367 additional sales on Gumroad for an older version of the product and another 164 sales on Lemon Squeezy, when he tested an alternative payment platform.
Chin attributes his earnings to the growing uptake of Notion templates, which in turn has led to a bank of customers willing to pay for such digital products, ranging from US$5 to packages worth up to US$200. However, he says that “growth has slowed since mid-2023 due to increased competition in the market.”
Why many gravitate to Notion is its flexibility. Some Kuala Lumpur-based startup founders Tech in Asia spoke with say that the platform allows them to combine all of the basic functions from sales to product planning in a single window.
Through simple templates, users can collaborate across different tasks by setting up notes, databases, calendars, and project boards. Think of Atlassian’s Trello but with more capabilities and functions.
Notion has a strong following. More than 300,000 users have joined the Reddit community focused on the platform.

Besides this, free templates abound on Facebook groups, and there are various YouTube and TikTok videos that advise viewers on how to make their Notion pages look good.
Chin’s foray into Notion came as a hobby, and he says that he has not taken any courses on graphic design or coding. But because of his passion for tech, he has experience using Sketch, a design software, for school and personal projects.
It was only in 2022 when he realized that Notion templates could “become a significant aspect of my personal brand,” as well as something that could be a “sustainable source of income,” he says.
On the edge of burnout
Notion’s flexibility is a double-edged sword. That’s where people like Chin come in to help users navigate its complexities.
But not everyone is singing the same tune as Chin.
Christina (not her real name), a Kuala Lumpur-based solopreneur, tells Tech in Asia that deriving an income at Chin’s level proved a Herculean effort. She has been running her own content shop for the past 10 years and earns most of her income from the internet.
She does user interface and user experience designs for a company in Singapore and another in the US, as well as ad hoc content writing for a number of Malaysian corporations. Her entire business brings her roughly 30,000 ringgit (US$6,300) in monthly earnings before taxes.
But last year, she decided to focus on building a business on Notion templates. The first challenge she encountered was her lack of social media presence.

Image credit: Timmy Loen

Christina has a presence on X, Instagram, and YouTube. However, she realized that it would be beneficial if she launched her products with a “sizable audience and presence on a single social media platform such as X or Instagram,” which she says she doesn’t have yet.
She also noticed that building a Notion templates business can be a grind. Chin posts on his social feeds regularly and at a certain cadence. Christina tried matching his regularity but failed to do so because she has other gigs to tend to.
“You’re also vulnerable to algorithmic changes,” she adds, referring to when tycoon Elon Musk bought Twitter and introduced a slew of changes, which she says disrupted the way her followers discovered her posts.
Despite these setbacks, Christina was able to make around 20,000 ringgit (US$4,202) from selling Notion templates last year. While that’s nothing compared to the “six figures” Chin earned that year, she sees it as “good pocket money and a good learning experience.”
She says most of her sales came from subscribers of her newsletter and from existing clients in her other gigs.
Christina adds that despite not actively creating new templates, those that she already uploaded for sale still fetch her a small monthly sum of 1,000 ringgit (US$210). Purchasers either discover her on Gumroad, a marketplace for content creators, or through her social media feeds and newsletter.
But selling Notion templates as a stand-alone business is not for her.
Profitable from the start
Competition is fierce in the Notion templates business because of its low barrier to entry. Most of the platforms where these are sold follow a freemium model, which means one can get started without any capital upfront.
Digital marketplace Gumroad takes a fee from sales, same with newsletter platform Substack and subscription service Patreon. Social media is free but there are optional paid features such as X’s Blue subscription.

But its ease of entry has also allowed people like Chin to be “profitable from the start,” even when it was only a hobby for him.
Chin explains that since he lived with his parents when he started making the templates, they covered internet fees and other utility bills. He didn’t have to pay for software for subscriptions as in the beginning he used the free tiers on tools such as Notion, Figma and Gumroad.
“I only moved on to investing my earnings into buying domains, making my websites and paying for better plans/tools after I started making money from Notion templates,” he says.
But can Chin sustain his earnings from selling templates in the long term? He says that while Notion has seen more adoption from professionals and businesses, he expects the software to reach its peak and be overtaken by something new.
Chin isn’t focused on diversifying either, unlike what other solopreneurs like Christina are doing. He also isn’t interested in making the full-time jump to work at a large corporation while drawing a stable paycheck.
For now, he is doubling down on building a “strong personal brand that your audience trusts,” which he hopes will carry him through as he explores building his own thing – even if Notion isn’t in the picture.

SMEs anywhere need financing to develop their businesses, including those operating in supply chain. However, doing so can be challenging: Supply chain financing is usually considered to be more risky due to limited data and tools to make the credit decision.
Doxa Holdings, a Singapore-based fintech firm, seeks to address this issue by providing a digital procurement platform for the supply chain space, among other industries. It has recently secured a new investment from Cento Ventures in an undisclosed amount and stage.
This round follows a US$2.2 million pre-series A round from 2022.
Doxa’s platform automates the procurement process, where all transaction data is tracked and analyzed, thus providing data points for credit scoring. According to its website, clients also include those in the construction and real estate development industries.
Edmund Ng, co-founder and CEO of Doxa, said that the company is looking to expand into new customer segments and geographies. In a statement, the firm said it aims to enter Malaysia by collaborating with an unnamed financial institution.
In Singapore, it has partnered with Visa and UOB to offer payment solutions for contractors. Doxa has also entered the Indonesian market with a customer in the healthcare industry, though it has not specified the details.

1. Strong growth in trips and monthly active consumers on the platform
Trips grew by 24% year over year, while monthly active users rose by 15% during the same timeframe. This indicates that Uber’s user base and engagement are increasing, a positive sign for its continued growth.
This contributed to a 15% growth in revenue for the US-based company, generating US$9.9 billion in 2023 compared to the previous year.
2. Record adjusted EBITDA margin
Uber hit a record adjusted EBITDA margin (as a percentage of gross bookings) of 3.4% in Q4 2023, up from 2.2% during the same period in 2022. This indicates an improvement in operating efficiency.
However, Uber’s delivery revenue margin (as a percentage of gross bookings) dropped to 18.3% in Q4 2023 from 20.5% in Q4 2022.
3. Robust net income and cash flow
Uber generated a net income of US$1.4 billion in Q4 2023 compared to a net loss of US$595 million in the same year-ago period. Its operating cash flow also reached US$823 million while its free cash flow hit US$768 million.

836374,2024-02-08T02:00:30,2024-02-07T07:00:45,Behind Bank Neo Commerce’s quest to enhance financial inclusion in Indonesia,bank-neo-commerces-quest-enhance-financial-inclusion-indonesia,publish,post,https://www.techinasia.com/bank-neo-commerces-quest-enhance-financial-inclusion-indonesia,"For many people, being able to use digital financial services is just a fact of modern life. So it might surprise them to know just how difficult it is for others to access them.
Consider Indonesia, where around 80% of the population is considered unbanked or underbanked because of the country’s highly fragmented geography. Someone in rural Sumatra, for example, would have to travel for miles just to access an ATM, pay bills, or apply for a loan.

That’s the problem that Bank Neo Commerce (BNC) aims to solve with a “one-stop solution” through its Neobank app, says IT director Chen Jun. The app lets customers access various financial services like bank accounts, time deposits, loans, online transfers, and bill payments without having to visit a physical branch.
“The idea is very simple: We’re trying to bring the bank into the cellphone and Indonesians to the modern world, where every service can be brought online very easily,” he says.
Enabling financial inclusion
By making financial services more accessible through digitalization, BNC is enabling Indonesia’s thriving digital economy, where high smartphone penetration rates and a burgeoning GDP per capita has made it Southeast Asia’s “most important digital financial services market.”
“People need financial services but they’re hard to obtain, and financial institutions and internet companies see an opportunity in that gap,” says Jun. “If geography prevents you from delivering something offline, then there is likely a chance you can do it online, which is what BNC is trying to do.”

Chen Jun, IT director at BNC / Photo credit: BNC

Since 2010, Indonesia’s digital banking scene has flourished, with players such as BNC working to close the country’s financial inclusion gap. At the end of 2022, EY reported that roughly 42% of Indonesians have engaged with some form of digital banking product or service.
BNC is also focused on making financial services cheaper for customers and small businesses.
“Three or four years ago, transfer fees in this country were really high, which introduced a lot of friction into every economic activity,” he says. “Our free fund transfer services help reduce that friction, especially for small merchants and businesses who are reluctant to use online services because of charges.”
These solutions can also be used by BNC’s corporate clients and partners who have integrated the bank’s services into their own systems.
The problem of scale
While BNC’s success might have been built on a simple idea, creating the infrastructure needed to support its diverse range of solutions was a more complicated journey.
“When you’re trying to provide lots of different services to meet each client’s needs, the fact is that their habits and preferences will keep changing,” says Jun. “That necessitates lots of trial and error on our part, which means that our system needs to be able to handle lots of fast iteration.”

He adds that the bank’s initial strategy was to grow its customer base quickly by providing a comprehensive range of solutions. This meant that its system needed to be able to handle both volume of customers and breadth of services, along with constant tweaks and finetuning – and any downtime was out of the question.
“We were faced with the challenge of not only ensuring our applications were adaptable but also transparent and flexible,” recalls Jun.
In a normal week, BNC releases two or three updates to its app – a grueling pace by any measure – placing pressure on its teams and tech stack to be flexible and adaptable.
“If our customer numbers go up by 10x, then our facility has to grow at the same pace,” says Jun.
Right partner, right time
In looking for a tech partner to help it with these capacity needs, BNC came into contact with Huawei Cloud and found its stack the perfect fit.
For one thing, Huawei offers adaptability thanks to an open architecture. This lets BNC manage multiple applications and resources on a single platform.
Jun explains that the Huawei Cloud Stack is able to back up the Neobank app’s features across 20 different cloud services. This also means that BNC can easily integrate its partner services into the platform.

In addition, the stack uses big data, AI, and virtual assistants to automatically manage traffic through its system with minimal disruptions.
Jun also highlights the support that BNC receives from Huawei in running the stack. Apart from a 24/7 support hotline, Huawei helps BNC with the maintenance of its data center. According to Jun, as the bank continuously improves on its services, having the support of Huawei’s cloud stack has helped minimize the impact of system updates on customers, ensuring business continuity.
“We also work closely with them when it comes to building in more equipment or infrastructure,” he shares. “Whenever we scale up, we discuss with Huawei’s team to figure out what equipment or new software would be most compatible.”
“BNC is an established bank, but in many ways we operate like a startup,” adds Jun. “So having that kind of constant support is really important to us.”
Expanding plans
The ongoing partnership with BNC and Huawei Cloud will continue to grow as the bank steps up its expansion into Indonesia’s customer base.
Jun says that in the near term, BNC will be focused on reaching out to younger users, who are set to be the country’s fastest-growing customer segment. Huawei’s system will be essential to these plans, allowing the bank to meet the generation’s preference for cutting-edge services.
Looking further ahead, BNC has plans to expand its business into new markets, which will necessitate investments in more software and hardware. Jun believes that working with Huawei will help the bank remain robust without overburdening its operations.
“Compared to our early days, there will be more room to grow,” he says. “Once we reach a certain size, we will start shifting our focus to business continuity, and the security and stability of our system.”

Even with the advent of digitalization, supply chains often remain plagued by inefficiencies, resulting in slow deliveries, high inventory costs, and production disruptions.
That’s what Sensos, a spin-off of Sony Semiconductor Israel, aims to address. The startup recently secured US$20 million series A funding led by Magenta Venture Partners, an Israeli VC firm backed by Japanese trading firm Mitsui. Also participating are JAL Ventures, Israel Cargo Logistics, and Sumitomo Corporation.
Sensos offers what it calls the first globally connected, disposable cellular label. Sized slightly larger than a credit card, the label can be stuck onto a parcel and provides GPS-powered location tracking, temperature monitoring, as well as sensor-powered automatic proof of delivery, among other things.
The company then combines those labels with AI-assisted control towers, which then collects and analyzes data. Aviv Castro, CEO of the Tel Aviv-based startup, says that with Sensos, companies can optimize production, inventory, and shipping while reducing greenhouse gas emissions to meet ESG regulations.
Sensos was spun off from Sony Semiconductor Israel in 2022. It counts clients like Bayer, Lufthansa, and DB Schenker, whose use cases include cold chain life-science products, consumer electronics, mission-critical shipments, and high-value goods.

Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba Group increased its revenue by 5% year on year in the third quarter of FY 2024 to US$36.67 billion, slightly lower than what analysts estimated.
The company, whose financial year ends March 31, also generated US$7.4 billion in adjusted EBITDA – a 2% jump compared to the same period in 2023. However, income from operations decreased 36% year on year to US$3.17 billion.
Alibaba attributed the decline to noncash items, namely impairment on retail arm Sun Art’s intangible assets and video platform Youku’s goodwill. Regardless, net cash provided by operating activities still fell by 26% year on year.
In a statement, group CEO Eddie Wu said the company’s top priority is to “reignite the growth of our core businesses, ecommerce and cloud computing.”
“We will step up investment to improve users’ core experiences to drive growth in Taobao and Tmall Group and strengthen market leadership in the coming year,” said Wu. “We will also focus our resources on developing public cloud products and sustaining the strong growth momentum in international commerce business.”
Taobao and Tmall Group continued to be Alibaba’s main revenue drivers, contributing US$18.2 billion. This was followed by its international digital commerce segment, which grew 44% year on year to US$4 billion in revenue.
“Solid growth” across all retail platforms, especially from AliExpress’ cross-border Choice business, fueled Alibaba’s strong international performance. The company added that Choice represented half of AliExpress’ total orders for January 2024, while the loss per order at Lazada, its Southeast Asian arm, continued to narrow.
Alibaba’s cloud unit posted US$3.9 billion in revenue for the quarter, a 3% uptick compared to the same year-ago period. Furthermore, revenue from the Digital Media and Entertainment Group rose 18% year over year to US$710 million, driven by robust growth in Alibaba Pictures’ offline entertainment sector.
Throughout the 2023 calendar year, Alibaba Group had repurchased US$9.5 billions’ worth of ordinary shares. On that note, the company’s board of directors has approved a US$25 billion increase in its share repurchase program through the end of March 2027.
Toby Xu, the group’s CFO, said the move demonstrated Alibaba’s “confidence in the outlook of [its] business and cash flow.”

India-based Cactus Venture Partners (CVP) has closed its first fund at over US$76 million, marking one of India’s largest first-time venture capital funds.
Domestic limited partners comprise 60% of the fund’s investor base. They include development financial institutions such as SIDBI, Self-Reliant India Fund (SRI Fund), and the UP Startup Fund.
CVP has a primary interest in climate tech, healthtech, and B2B software-as-a-service companies, though it said it has a broad sector focus. The firm targets series A startups and those in the early series B stage.
Currently, CVP has five companies in its portfolio, including cleantech startup Lohum and global clothing brand AMPM. The fund plans to make eight to 10 more investments over the next one to two years, primarily in Indian startups but with an eye on international expansion.
The fund’s general partners are Amit Sharma (previously with Alibaba-backed eWTP Capital), Anurag Goel, and former investment banker Rajeev Kalambi.

Indonesia is one of the top greenhouse gas (GHG) emitters globally, but the country’s businesses, both large and small, lag in addressing emissions.
To tackle this, East Ventures has teamed up with Kadin Indonesia – the country’s chamber of commerce and industry – as well as research firm WRI Indonesia to launch Ecovisea, a free global GHG calculator for businesses in Indonesia.
Ecovisea gauges emissions in three domains: emissions from company-owned sources, those from purchased energy, and indirect emissions from other parts of a company’s value chain. It uses emission factor information from Climatiq, a carbon calculation platform.
Once a company is verified and registered on Ecovisea, it can upload certain data and then gain real-time access to the results. By doing so, companies can contribute toward the Paris Agreement’s goal of capping global temperature increases at 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2050.
“This innovative tool streamlines the previously manual carbon calculation process and empowers businesses to visualize sources of GHG emissions to better identify emission reduction strategies,” says Avina Sugiarto, partner at East Ventures.
ESG has taken an increasingly important role at East Ventures. The firm previously said it follows a “strict” exclusion list for investments, while setting up a dedicated ESG team.
Meanwhile, Ecovisea is one result of a memorandum of understanding signed by East Ventures, Kadin, and WRI Indonesia at the Indonesia Net-Zero Summit 2022.

Hello reader,
There’s nothing wrong with having a leg up in life, as long as you acknowledge your privilege.
Nobody can choose their background, so there’s no shame in getting a head start from your family or connections. Where disingenuity or shame comes in is when someone refuses to admit that they’ve had at least a slight advantage over their peers. See Musk, Elon.
Being blind to how you got where you are could also impede you from making good decisions about moving forward. If you think all your successes were entirely of your own doing, why would you ever question any of your choices?
Philippines-based KonsultaMD knows it got an “unfair” boost, thanks to backing from major local firms Globe Telecom and Ayala Corporation. But crucially, the healthtech firm’s leaders recognize and have used that edge  to help it become a leading player in the industry.
Today we look at:

Bill of good health for KonsultaMD

Image credit: Timmy Loen

KonsultaMD began life in 2015 as a teleconsultation platform but has since grown into a super app that provides medicine delivery and a marketplace of healthcare providers.
Backing from telecoms major Globe and property developer Ayala gave insurance companies, health maintenance organizations (HMOs), and healthcare providers the confidence to partner with KonsultaMD, CEO Susana Beatriz Latay tells Tech in Asia.


App, app, and away: The new KonsultaMD app was launched in May 2023 after a merger between HealthNow, a medicine delivery service firm, and Aide, a homecare and diagnostic services provider.  KonsultaMD allows patients to speak to a primary care doctor, obtain a prescription, and get medicine delivered to their door. It also offers a marketplace of healthcare providers for post-consultation care, such as home blood tests, for example. The app was the most downloaded in the Philippines’ healthtech sector last year, according to data intelligence platform Data.ai.

Better together: Bundling its services with Globe’s mobile plans has helped KonsultaMD, reach new users.  Roughly 56% of KonsultaMD users are Globe subscribers, according to Latay.

Healthcare gaps: Affordability of healthcare remains a key issue for Filipinos. Despite a universal healthcare act that was signed into law in 2019, experts say universal coverage is many years away. Amid inadequate healthcare facilities and exorbitant medical fees, the private sector plays an important role in supplementing the government’s coverage.

Rollercoaster: According to Yongfook, the company hit US$53,000 in monthly recurring revenue in 2023, but that figure fell by US$3,000 since November. He added that while the live updates generate positivity when “things are going well,” the effects are decidedly more negative during downturns.

Utility: Founded in 2020, Bannerbear provides a template design tool that can create automated variations of images. These can be used for social media posts and ecommerce banners, among other things.

Ideas man: Yongfook created another SaaS service named Browserbear in 2023. The platform helps automate browser tasks such as testing websites and capturing data.

Simplus, a direct-to-consumer home appliance brand, said it increased its sales threefold while becoming profitable in 2023 in its bid to become the “Philips of Southeast Asia.”
Founded in 2021 and headquartered in Thailand, Simplus is led by former Lazada Thailand CEO Jack Zhang. The company’s products include air fryers and vacuum cleaners, whose prices range from US$15 to US$50 per item.
Its current best-seller in Thailand is its Dyson-inspired hair dryer, which gets over 4,100 purchases a month. The brand said it serves over one million customers across six countries in Southeast Asia, including Singapore and Indonesia.
“Simplus is determined to serve local consumers with tailor-made products, well-managed quality, world-class service, and importantly, the most competitive pricing possible,” said Zhang in a statement.
The company raised an undisclosed amount of funding in early 2023 from AC Ventures as it expanded into Indonesia. Simplus’ products are available on platforms like Lazada and Tokopedia, and the firm maintains an offline presence through its partnership with HomePro, one of Thailand’s largest retailers.
Simplus said it ranked first on TikTok Shop and second on Shopee’s small home appliances category during last year’s Double 11 shopping festival. It reached a peak of US$1 million in sales in a single day, Simplus said.

The road ahead, however, may get rocky.
Across the board, startups in Southeast Asia quickly fell in love with genAI products in 2022. Founders and engineers we spoke to said they use it to manage schedules and emails, generate content, and analyze data.
Despite the outpouring of love for AI possibilities, few founders seem interested in taking the next step: integrating genAI into their core business.

“I think individuals are embracing AI quite well because if you see something that can quickly make you more productive or outsource your work a little bit – especially if you’re pretty overloaded – hey, why not?” says Daan Van Rossum, the CEO of FlexOS, an AI-focused website based in Vietnam that provides news and offers advice to businesses. “But at a company enterprise level, it’s still very early days for real wide adoption.”
The issue is also evident in the US. The Economist reported last month that despite the hype around genAI across the country, business spending on “information-processing equipment and software” was down 0.4% in 2023. Capital expenditure (capex) in general is also falling at a rate of 4% each year.
In short, companies aren’t increasing their budgets to acquire the new tech. That’s telling, considering the boom years that surrounded the rise in personal computers between 1992 and 1999, when companies on average increased capex by an average of 3%.
A poll conducted by Tech in Asia – which saw the participation of 25 startup founders in Southeast Asia – found that many companies here also hesitate on investing in AI. While some are just being cautious, others are still trying it out.
Most are unsure about increasing their spending on AI without a clearer path to seeing a return on their investment.
Over 52% of startups in the poll spent below US$1,000 on genAI tools last year. About 20% of these founders say they are happy using the free versions of popular apps like ChatGPT.
Further, most of the founders and engineers Tech in Asia spoke to had not successfully integrated AI into their product offerings to customers yet, although not for a lack of trying.
AI is good for a “ton of things”
Those that have added AI to their workflow say they use it to cut costs, hone their business strategies, and use it for general administrative purposes like creating marketing or sales content, summarizing reports, and managing emails.
Alex Svanevik, the CEO of crypto analytics platform Nansen.ai, says his company uses the tech for “a ton of things.”

“Collectively, one of our goals this quarter is to spend 5,000 hours working with AI – this works out to around 10% of our time,” he tells Tech in Asia. He says the company’s goal is to use AI in two ways: to enhance its products and to drive productivity in the organization.
Nansen currently uses it for strategy development, executive coaching, legal support, coding, as well as summarizing documents and meetings.
He called ChatGPT – if given enough business context and the correct prompts – “a very valuable sparring partner and advisor.”
But some companies, even those who say they now use AI in their current business, don’t plan on investing in it.
Michael D’Ambrosio, the co-founder and director of Orchid Sports and Entertainment, a sports agency that focuses on investment and sponsorship deals, tells Tech in Asia that it uses AI for briefs on sponsors that are looking to partner with the firm.
“You can do a Google search for that, but it’s not great,” he says. “AI helps us filter our opportunities and has proven useful and successful so far. But we don’t spend money on that.”
D’Ambrosio says the business’ current strategy of using AI, which he calls a “basic, simple use case,” doesn’t justify an increase in spending.
He says the company uses the free version of ChatGPT, as well as Bing and Bard. Though he admits that the company has spent money on Midjourney.

Baskit founder Yann Schuermans / Photo credit: Baskit

Yann Schuermans, co-founder and CEO of Jakarta-based B2B ecommerce logistics firm Baskit, tells Tech in Asia that his company has been working on using AI and machine learning to “incrementally” digitalize warehouses to create a more interconnected supply chain.
Schuermans says the company captures supply chain data from warehouses and uses it to optimize routes.
“On the logistics side, there’s a ton that we can do,” he adds.
Struggling to change mindsets
But not all of Schuermans’ clients are interested.
He encourages clients to work with AI, telling them that the data it provides could help them grow and drive revenue. But ongoing issues at these companies, such as the lack of payment systems, preference for cash, or old software that can’t be accessed remotely, are often an impediment.
He adds that a lot of Indonesia’s legacy infrastructure is run by “folks that have been doing business in that way for a very long period of time, and there’s no one that’s going to change that.”
But Schuermans isn’t giving up on the new tech. He says that once the infrastructure is established, he will be able to cut costs by eliminating portions of his data admin team.
Efficiency vs. hallucinations
Ankur Jalan, the head of engineering at GajiGesa, an Indonesian earned-wage access startup, says he’s had some hits and misses using genAI.
The company instituted a chatbot, which has automated about 80% of customer interactions. The company also uses it for data analytics, which he says has made operations much more efficient.

It has also helped his team code faster. They were working on a fund disbursement tool and built it within a day by just feeding details to the genAI system, he says.
“We had to tweak it a bit, make sure that it is working as per our standards, but more than 80% of the job was done,” he adds. “If engineers worked on it, it would be a four-day project.”
But when the firm attempted to build an AI model that could recommend to clients how to manage their spending and build savings, it began to have problems with hallucinations – a term used when AI makes up answers.
Despite this, Ankur says he is still enthusiastic about genAI and is looking to develop an AI tool to help people with their finances.
He says it wasn’t an easy journey to convince the company’s board that investing in AI was the right decision, especially after the infrastructure costs shot up. But the business has now allocated around 5% of its budget for AI development.
This sentiment could be seen in our poll numbers too. Despite the hesitancy shown by some, about 65% of the startups from Southeast Asia say they would like to increase their spend on genAI tools this year.
Job losses: The part you knew was coming
But while all the founders that Tech in Asia spoke to saw advantages to AI, many were concerned about the long-term impact of the new technology and about its effect on employment. Job losses are coming, they warned.
Van Rossum of Vietnam AI firm FlexOS says there will be a clash between employees and employers, what he calls “The Big Renegotiation.”

Image credit: Timmy Loen

“Like, where does the productivity gain go? Does it go to the employee? Does it go to the employer?”
Indeed, about 60% of the founders in the poll say they would or are thinking about reducing their employment costs due to the use of generative AI.
While the issue has already made headlines thanks to strikes in Hollywood, with actors and writers facing off against movie and TV producers, Van Rossum warns that it could hit in any industry.
Professionals, such as lawyers or engineers, will become better at their jobs with AI, but it is going to cut out “tons and tons of manual work” that would have employed supporting staff.
“But what’s the alternative, right?” he says, “Are you going to be the only company not embracing AI? You’re going to have people that are 40% less effective than at your competitor.”","Founders in SEA use genAI in the office for a lot of reasons, but most are still cautious about making it an integral part of their businesses.",Scott Shuey,Editing by Collin Furtado and Jaclyn Tiu,open,0,"",https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1707225697_Featured-image-The-good-the-bad-and-the-hallucinations-What-SEA-startups-think-of-AI.png,false,"",false,true,true,true,false,7,,1382,"The good, the bad, and the hallucinations: What SEA startups think of AI","Founders in SEA use genAI in the office for a lot of reasons, but most are still cautious about making it an integral part of their businesses.",,,"","",""

The answer is making decisions – making hard decisions, to be precise.
And why is getting the hard decisions right so important? Very simply, so that I can sleep well at night.

Photo credit: Tingey Injury Law Firm / Unsplash

Framework
We call them hard decisions because the outcome is hard to predict and the stage before such a decision is made is dynamic and unclear.
I have developed a simple framework over the years, and it has served me well.
To me, making decisions is like operating a machine. There is an input, an engine, and an output.
It starts with arranging information as a good input. This process depends on cognitive skills, and the three most important cognitive skills are the speed of processing information, category formation, and pattern recognition.
Fortunately, the speed of processing information is not correlated to experience or age. Any young decision-maker can develop this cognitive skill.
On the other hand, category formation and pattern recognition require experience, and as you mature, you develop a broader view.
The ability to define categories well requires exposure to what’s possible in life. To help hone this skill, we can explore new things, such as by traveling to new places, learning new skills, or meeting new people.
Pattern recognition is harder to master. It requires the observation of consistency that is coated by inconsistency. It requires one to neutralize information from personal and group biases. Age and experience matter for this.
Principles
Once the information is organized, you put it into the engine. Then comes the principles of processing information.
The three principles that I use a lot are the Pareto principle, the principle of diminishing returns, and the power of three.
The Pareto principle says that 80% of consequences come from just 20% of the causes. In our era of information overload, just 20% of the information we’re faced with, the tasks we do, or the decisions we make give us 80% of the important outcomes. This is the engine that helps filter many decisions into a few important ones.
When we make similar decisions many times, there will be similarly good results, which is convenient. But over time, the value will be diminished. This is the law of diminishing returns.
However, by doing the reverse, thinking outside of the box, or being contrarian, we can not only narrow down many decisions into a few important ones, but also expect that they will produce results with higher value than usual.
My favorite principle is what I call the power of three.
Three is a number of options that is easily remembered too. Even this article and my previous article from eight years ago were constructed using the power of three from the beginning.
Let me walk you through the steps. The best decision is one decision. But sometimes, we need two options. Black or white? Yes or no? Right or wrong? Unfortunately, life is not that simple, so we need a third option, which is gray, neutral, or no decision.
By applying the three principles established earlier, filter the options into one. That one potential decision, the output, must be tested and guarded by three core values.
This is very personal, and what’s important to you may not be important to me. My core values are integrity, empathy, and excellence. As long as the decision-making process is guarded by these values, in that exact order of priority, I can live with the decision, whatever the outcome will be.
And to be clear, making good decisions is different from making good investment decisions.","Making hard decisions is, in a word, hard.

SentinelOne, a US cybersecurity firm listed on the New York Stock Exchange, has completed its acquisition of PingSafe, a Singapore-based cloud security startup.
TechCrunch reported last month that the acquisition valued PingSafe at over US$100 million.
The deal comes roughly six months after PingSafe raised a US$3.3 million seed round from Surge, Peak XV Partners’ scale-up program. Rajan Anandan, the VC firm’s managing director, wrote on his X account last month that PingSafe’s acquisition is “among the fastest ‘seed to significant exits’ [the] Indian ecosystem has ever seen.”
SentinelOne plans to integrate PingSafe’s cloud-native application protection platform with its cloud workload security and cloud data security capabilities.
Among other things, doing so would “eliminate the need for companies to navigate the complexity of multiple-point solutions,” said Ric Smith, SentinelOne’s chief product and technology officer, in a statement. “Instead, they can comprehensively manage their entire attack surface from a single platform.”
Founded in 2022 by CEO Anand Prakash and CTO Nishant Mittal, PingSafe counts the likes of Flipkart, Razorpay, and Near Intelligence as clients. Prakash is a white-hat hacker who has identified vulnerabilities in major platforms like Uber, Meta, and X.

The Indonesian president, widely known as Jokowi, has served two consecutive terms and is credited with boosting Indonesia’s digital economy, which was worth almost US$80 billion last year.
In 2022, he met with Tesla CEO Elon Musk at the SpaceX launch facility in Boca Chica, US, as part of his administration’s efforts to court Tesla to build a factory in Indonesia. Even though Tesla later backed out, the country’s nickel reserves remain a selling point to attract other EV giants.

Beyond the nation’s digital economy, many are also closely watching the stance of incoming leadership on protecting SMEs, a key issue in last year’s controversial ban on TikTok Shop.
TikTok went on to seal a deal with Tokopedia. However, the broader ramifications of this decision and future SME support remain unclear in the post-Jokowi era.
Maintaining a grip on social commerce?
Puteri Anetta Komarudin, spokesperson for the campaign of presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto, tells Tech in Asia that the frontrunner intends to maintain the ban on direct transactions on social media. He aims to limit its use solely to promoting the sale of goods.
This isn’t a surprise. His running mate, vice presidential candidate Gibran Rakabuming Raka (Jokowi’s eldest son), previously voiced his support for prohibiting TikTok Shop, citing concerns about its negative impact on local MSMEs.

Last week, TikTok announced that it had finalized a deal to acquire a 75% stake in Tokopedia valued at US$2.2 billion, according to GoTo’s latest public disclosure. This acquisition paves the way for TikTok Shop’s return to the Indonesian market.
Although it may seem like a “concession,” TikTok now has nearly full control over Tokopedia, Shopee’s main competitor in the country. Former Jakarta-based ByteDance executive Vonny Ernita Susamto has also taken over as the new CEO of Tokopedia, indicating just how much of a grip the social media firm has on the Indonesian ecommerce platform.
However, local regulators are expected to continue monitoring the operations of the TikTok-Tokopedia entity, and potential policy shifts in the incoming administration could still influence this merger.
For example, the two other presidential candidates – former Jakarta governor Anies Baswedan and former Central Java governor Ganjar Pranowo – take a different stance about how the Jokowi government handled TikTok Shop last year.
According to our interviews with their campaign executives, these candidates view the sale of “extremely cheap products” on TikTok Shop — suspected to be mostly imported — as the main concern. That’s why they favor revising the regulations, focusing on pricing controls rather than an outright ban on social commerce transactions.
“Offline merchants’ complaints about TikTok Shop were mainly related to its low prices, making it difficult for them to compete. It’s not about the technology,” says Leontinus Alpha Edison, co-captain of Baswedan’s campaign team and co-founder of Tokopedia.

Sofian Hadiwijaya, executive tech director of Pranowo’s campaign team and co-founder of Warung Pintar, highlighted the crucial role of social commerce in helping merchants sell their products.
As Tech in Asia previously analyzed in our coverage of TikTok Shop, social media users often transition from entertainment to purchases, enticed by the products showcased in livestreaming sessions.
Prior to the ban, TikTok Shop exemplified the potential of Indonesia’s social commerce market, generating a daily gross merchandise value worth about US$20 million in the country alone, Momentum Works estimates.

“King” of EV battery production
Known for his aggressive push toward electric vehicles (EVs), Jokowi has implemented both purchase subsidies and tax exemptions to incentivize their adoption. With this move, the president aims to attract more investments to the country.
As of November 2023, Indonesia has roughly 74,000 two-wheeler EVs and 20,000 electric cars on its roads. The government aims to increase these numbers to 13 million electric motorcycles and 2 million electric cars by 2030.
Jokowi’s existing EV policies would likely be maintained under frontrunner Subianto, according to the presidential candidate’s spokesperson Komarudin. This includes completing the construction of Indonesia’s largest EV battery factory in Karawang, West Java, this year.
Built in collaboration with South Korea’s LG Energy Solution and Hyundai, this factory will have an annual production capacity of 30 million battery cells to power more than 180,000 electric cars annually. “Leveraging Indonesia’s vast nickel reserves, we aim [for the country] to become the global ‘king’ of electric vehicle batteries,” Komarudin says.
Following Tesla’s cancellation of its factory plan in Indonesia in 2023, other competitors remain bullish on the country’s potential as both a market and a manufacturing hub for EVs.

Last month, Chinese giant BYD launched three new EV battery models in the country, aiming to lead the market in Indonesia. VinFast also plans to build an EV factory in the country this year with an initial investment of US$200 million.
Hadiwijaya, representing the campaign team of former Central Java governor Pranowo, says the incoming administration should push foreign EV companies to share knowledge with domestic players. This, he believes, will facilitate the formation of “win-win” partnerships for the country’s EV development.
Reenergizing the startup ecosystem
All candidates vying to lead Indonesia aim to attract foreign investments by streamlining regulations, offering tax breaks, and providing funding programs for startup founders.
Many Indonesian startups heavily rely on foreign investors for growth, but navigating the complexities of securing such funding can be challenging. Most opt for incorporating parent entities in Singapore, known for its streamlined and investor-friendly environment.
Dondi Hananto, a partner at the Singapore-based VC firm Patamar Capital, said that administrative hurdles in Indonesia have prompted many startups to prefer creating entities in Singapore.
The rule that requires a minimum investment of 10 billion rupiah (US$630,000) for foreign investments in Indonesian companies is one example, he says. This, Hananto notes, creates a barrier for pre-seed and seed rounds typically involving smaller amounts.
“We hope that the policy becomes more conducive for equity investment models because that’s what we do as VC,” he says.
Amid the tech winter, funding to startups in Indonesia has dropped 53% in 2023, according to the latest data from Tracxn. A series of notable startup and tech companies from the country have resorted to laying off staff, including GoTo, Xendit, Bukalapak, EdenFarm, Quola, Hypefast, and Funding Societies’ Modalku.
Companies such as edtech firm Zenius and travel tech company Pegipegi have shut down after more than a decade of operations.

In September 2023, the Jokowi administration launched a dedicated fund for Indonesian startups called the Merah Putih Fund. Targeting “soonicorns” – companies approaching unicorn status (US$1 billion valuation) – the fund focuses on investments in series C and D funding rounds. However, it has not announced any investments since its inception.
Pandu Sjahrir, founding partner at AC Ventures, suggests that the elected government could reignite enthusiasm within the startup industry if it demonstrates a strong commitment to developing the ecosystem. Investors are also “likely to respond positively” to a government that prioritizes the growth of the startup sector.
The VC firm has just closed its fifth fund at US$210 million, which is focused on Indonesian early-stage startups. Some of its portfolio from the fund include the electric vehicle maker Maka Motors and agritech firm Koltiva.
“Clarity in regulations, reduced bureaucratic hurdles, and a commitment to creating a favorable ecosystem for businesses can boost investor confidence,” Sjahrir tells Tech in Asia.
In the run-up to the elections, investors are adopting a wait-and-see approach to anticipate potential policy and regulatory shifts.
East Ventures, for instance, is “attentive to potential business implications, from possible slowdowns to accelerated spending,” says its managing partner, Roderick Purwana.
For founders like SaaS startup Majoo’s Adi Wahyu Rahadi and rural ecommerce platform Dagangan’s Ryan Manafe, they hope that existing startup development programs, such as accelerators and startup incubators, will be sustained and enhanced.

Rahadi calls for government regulations that incentivize widespread digital adoption in Indonesia. This is because limited digital literacy across the country makes acquiring users a major challenge for startups.
“Our hope is that the government can encourage the entire ecosystem to work together to make Indonesian society 100% digital. That will help startups a lot,” he says.

Cred has struck a deal to acquire Kuvera in a cash and stock transaction, expanding the India-based fintech giant’s reach into digital wealth management.
Kuvera says it has a client base of over 300,000 and manages assets worth over US$6 billion. Users of the platform, which offers zero-commission funds and various asset management tools, are mostly retail investors who put in “significantly more” than the average investor.
Following the merger, the Kuvera team will continue to operate autonomously and grow its network and brand by working closely with Cred. Kuvera’s services, including ongoing client investments, will also remain uninterrupted.
Cred operates a platform that rewards users for paying via their credit cards. The company previously said it is the fourth-largest app by value on the Unified Payments Interface, India’s real-time payment system.
In October, Cred said it generated around US$178.3 million in revenue for the year ended March 31, 2023. This marks a 3.5x improvement over the same year-ago period.
In addition to digital wealth management, the company also ventured into the buy now, pay later scene last year with the roll-out of Cred Flash. The service is powered by Parfait Finance and Investments, a non-banking financial company registered with the Reserve Bank of India.

Midjourney has appointed Ahmad Abbas, previously hardware engineer manager on Apple’s Vision Pro team, as head of hardware. 
This move, made in December, hints at the company’s potential entry into the hardware market.
Founded by David Holz, Midjourney is already working on Orb, a project that focuses on 3D data capture for AI training. However, details about the hardware remain scarce.
At the beginning of January 2024, however, Nick St. Pierre – a creative director specializing in AI – tweeted that the company had established a hardware team. 
Pierre also mentioned that the company is working on multiple hardware projects this year, with potential launches anticipated as soon as next year.
Before Midjourney, Holz co-founded Leap Motion, a company that produced a sensor device for hand and finger motion input in computing – similar to what can be found with Apple’s Vision Pro.
In 2016, Leap Motion introduced software for hand tracking in virtual reality. In 2018, the company was nearly acquired by Apple itself, but the deal fell through. Leap Motion was finally acquired by British company Ultrahaptics in 2019 and both were rebranded as Ultraleap.

Hello reader,
The grass overseas has always seemed greener to me.
My mother has often told me that even when I was young, she knew I would leave Northern Ireland as soon as I could. The world has just always seemed too big and interesting to stay in “Our Wee Country.”
I recognize I come from a privileged position, as I can move anywhere I can find work. And I think it’s a privilege that should be extended to everyone – because why should your birthplace dictate what opportunities you can go after?
Malaysia’s sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional seems to be taking a similar approach as it’s going where it sees opportunity. In this case, it appears to be weighing up an investment in India’s Oyo, despite a national mandate to invest at home. But isn’t home where the opportunity is?
Today we look at:

Khazanah sets sights on overseas investments

Khazanah Nasional, Malaysia’s sovereign wealth fund, is reportedly in talks to lead a US$400 million funding round in India’s Oyo Hotels &amp; Homes.
The news confused some Malaysia-based investors and founders, as government-linked investment companies (GLICs) had been told to focus investments on local firms by Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.


Inside track: Officials working at GLICs told Tech in Asia that the report should have come as no surprise, despite the national mandate. They explained that finding quality investments in Malaysia was tough due to the country’s lack of early-stage startups.

Losses on lingerie: Khazanah’s first ecommerce investment in India in 2015 left the fund with egg on its face. The fund bet on Indian lingerie maker Zivame and later faced losses of US$20 million in 2018, according to then Economics Affairs Minister Mohamed Azmin Ali. However, its US$250 million injection into Alibaba in 2012 was a big hit, scoring returns of US$1.2 billion seven years later.

Teething problems: While Khazanah and other GLICs have made some progress in investing in local companies, fundamental problems remain. Insiders told Tech in Asia that Khazanah has been held back by two things: a lack of talent to properly evaluate startups as investments, and its board, made up of the prime minister and two or three other ministers and bureaucrats. This can inject a political element into where the fund makes its investments.

News Spotlight
A lift for laid-off Lazadans

Singapore’s Food, Drinks, and Allied Workers Union (FDAWU) has secured an enhanced support package and a training fund for recently laid-off Lazada employees.
The negotiations between the ecommerce platform and union were facilitated by the Ministry of Manpower.


Tight-lipped: In early January, Tech in Asia reported that Lazada was expected to let go up to 30% of its staff across different markets. In a joint statement announcing the agreement, Lazada and the FDAWU did not detail the enhanced support package due to confidentiality reasons.

More to be done: Alongside Lazada, the National Trades Union Congress’ (NTUC) Employment and Employability Institute will set up the training fund for the affected FDAWU members. Non-unionized general branch members of the NTUC who were also affected by the layoffs can also expect some support, but it’s unclear what exactly that will entail.

Tough decisions: The NTUC first expressed disappointment over the layoffs on January 5. “We understand that companies may from time to time need to restructure but retrenchment should always be the last resort,” said its secretary-general Ng Chee Meng.

Two-wheeler electric vehicles are part of India’s efforts to promote net zero among the country’s middle class. The local market for these vehicles is projected to reach US$750 million by 2025.
Amid the rising momentum, one of the players in the country’s two-wheeler EV sector, River, recently secured US$40 million in a series B funding round.
Yamaha Motor led the investment, with participation from investors such as Al-Futtaim Automotive, Lowercarbon Capital, Toyota Ventures, and Maniv Mobility.
With the fresh funds, River aims to expand its distribution and service network for electric scooters across India. The company will also use the funds for research and development of new products.
Founded in 2021 by Aravind Mani and Vipin George, River launched its first electric scooter named Indie in October 2023, which was developed and produced in Bengaluru. The company also opened its first store in the city last month.
“We have built a great base in R&amp;D and manufacturing over the last two years, and now it’s time to grow,” said Mani, who also serves as River’s CEO, in a statement.
This latest investment brings River’s total funds raised to US$68 million since March 2021. It last secured US$11 million in a series A round in 2022.
