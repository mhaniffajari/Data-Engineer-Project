# SETUP: Using this project, we have run past minor versions of dbt
# to generate each contracted version of `manifest.json`.

# Whenever we bump the manifest version, we should add a new entry for that version
# into `data`, generated from this same project, and update the CURRENT_EXPECTED_MANIFEST_VERSION.
# You can generate the manifest using the generate_latest_manifest() method below.

# TEST: Then, using the *current* version of dbt (this branch),
# we will perform a `--state` comparison against those older manifests.

# Some comparisons should succeed, where we expect backward/forward compatibility.

# Comparisons against older versions should fail, because the structure of the
# WritableManifest class has changed in ways that prevent successful deserialization
# of older JSON manifests.
